My name is Mudahogora Ernestine . I was born in Bugeserain Ntarama district . My father was called Karinamaryo Peter and my mother was called Mukagasisi Veronica . We were seven in my family but I am the only one who survived . To start with , I know we migrated to Bugesera but that was not our origin . Our origin was Ruhengeri . We migrated in 1959 escaping the Hutu persecutions . When we were young kids , we used to hear our father saying that there used to be a very big forest where they used to live . So he would tell us how it was not very easy for them while they were fleeing . They were lucky they managed to reach Bugesera . He used to tell us ... he was once the chief 's personnel assistant , [ this is what I used to hear him saying when we were young kids ] . So , on their way while coming they asked him , " Hey you ! What 's your name ? @" He replied them , "@ My name is Karinamaryo @" because that was his name . So Habyarimana 's soldiers asked him again , "@ Karinamaryo ? @" meaning ‘ the shrewd one ’ . They went on and said , "@ Can you imagine ? Listen to this guy . So go ahead and show us your shrewdness @"@ . <EOS>
So they started beating him yet he was already lame as a result of previous beatings . People used to tell us about those days but for us it was just History , we never thought of something like the genocide we saw would ever happen . Probably in the same way our children will be taking it as History . Later life went on as it used to be . We grew up until the 1990s...in 1992 in Bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the Hutu were burning the Tutsi 's properties . By then we resided in Ntarama , which was out of [ Ntarama ] town . So it started from the side of Ngenda and Gashora because many Hutus resided in those areas . The area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration . It was a place where they used to take all the Tutsis who had migrated . They used to construct houses close to each other ; the Tutsi , neighbouring each other in that area , inhabited almost all houses . <EOS>
The killings had not yet started in our neighbourhood . Instead , they started from the side of Mayange and Musenyi . Areas that had many Hutus ‘ Abamere ’ residing there . Some of the Hutus living there were locals and some had there . We were lucky they would just stop in Nyamata and did not reach our village . But we were well informed on what was going on and the people in the attacked areas would flee from their homes to our home village . Life went though it was so tough , we always used to hear rumours of Hutu burning Tutsi properties . <EOS>
In short , we grew up knowing that there is no sympathy between the Hutu and Tutsi . We grew up knowing that Hutus are enemies of Tutsis . In fact , our parents used to tell us , "@ Dear children , Hutu are bad people . Look at the kind of life we are living and yet we used to be rich . We used to own cattle and so many other things but now we are poor , we do not own anything . This is not the life we were meant to live . We are like this just because of the Hutu . @" We did n't have any hope of living with the Hutu in community ; I do n't know why maybe it was due to what every Government that was in power subjected us to . We could hardly believe it would one day come to an end . <EOS>
We always used to wonder how it would all and end and the final answer came in 1994 . We were at home on the 7th of April 1994 . At night we heard that the President 's helicopter had crashed . My brother came in screaming , "@ We are all dead . I heard that Habyarimana is dead . @" I was still very young ; I was n't mature enough to understand issues concerning the war . I carelessly said , " Oh , if he is dead then we are finally going to get some peace . @" He replied to me , "@ Those are your wishes . All I can assure you is we are going to die . @" We kind of joked about it . The following day came but we did n't have any problems until the night fell . The next day we started hearing terrible rumours of houses being burnt here and there . I think it was four days after the death of Habyarimana that the Tutsis living in Nyamata started fleeing ; you would hear people saying , "@ Listen ! Things are getting worse here ! We have met people fleeing their homes . @" I wondered why but I heard some people saying that because of the plane crash and Habyarimana 's death , there is no way there could be peace in the country . <EOS>
Well things went on the same way . To us it seemed like the war had started . But in reality , it had only started in Nyamata , Kayumba and on the side of Maranyundo . Ntarama , my home village , was only attacked later on , compared to the other villages in that area . People from Nyamata were fleeing to the families in Ntarama because perpetrators had not yet reached there ; I mean the strong perpetrators . It was only the Hutu perpetrators in the neighbourhood that were killing then . People started fleeing and hiding in churches as it used to be in 1992 expecting it to be the same . On their way they would meet others fleeing from the same place . Some would change their direction and go back with them , while others would ask , “ Where are you going ? ” The other group would reply , “ It 's hell there . We are fleeing . They have burnt the whole area . ” Therefore , some would go back while other would go ahead . <EOS>
People were confused ; they were moving up and down . They would accuse each other to be cowards . Some would go to Nyamata while others were coming to Ntarama . And things went on like that for a while . In Nyamata , things were getting worse as days went by . The Nyamata church witnessed horrible shootings and killings . The survivors ran back to where they had come from . All the people [ Tutsi ] in Nyamata and other areashad been killed . Therefore , they started attacking the remaining areas . <EOS>
So , they reached home ; I mean my parents ' home . By then several people had reached at home because ; we lived well somewhere like ... as one could be living over there ... it is a place called Kayenzi ; when you are crossing towards Nyamata . By then they had n't attacked us ; they could just pass by crossing over to Nyamata . So they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there . They decided to try there . My uncles and aunts with other neighbours were living across the valley so they came and scattered themselves in the neighbouring houses . They would spend one or two days then things would worsen again . One day , I do n't remember which day but it had been two weeks since we were in that situation and the Interahamwe [ perpetrators ] had finished all people in Nyamata . They had killed people in Kayumba forest and killed everyone who was in church . They had killed everywhere else and the next place was my home village . I remember some people saying , "@ The attackers have come through the coffee plantation @"@ , which was slightly below our home . So I was wondering , I could n't imagine things such as killings , I though they were impossible . People were screaming , "@ They have come . @" And then they took off to the Ntarama church through the forest . Those who were still able to defend themselves with bows and spears fought them . At times they were able to defeat the Interahamwe and they would get a rest and go back home . The Interahamwe realized that they were not going to defeat the resistors with no guns . They said there were certainly ‘ Inyenzi ’ among them [ the resistors ] . While fleeing , the resistors used to try and fight back the Interahamwe but they started loosing courage as they were seeing about ten , twenty of them being killed , they started scattering . The strong guys fled towards Gitarama and Kabwayi , there remained very few and helpless people . <EOS>
My brother was among those who managed to run . He came home and told us [ that is when we were still alive ] , "@ Now things are really bad . We are defeated . We can not defend ourselves anymore and they have killed most of us . @" He told us , "@ They have killed so and so and so and so , who were the strongest men amongst us . @" He went on and said , " Everyone should now find his own way . @" He said so while preparing to live . Then , I asked him , "@ Where are you going now ? @" He replied , "@ We are going to look for a safer place where to take refuge . @" I again asked , "@ Will you not be killed there ? @" He said he did n't know . He went on and said " Bye for now . If I happen to die ... and if I survive we shall meet again . @" That was the last words we heard from him . So he walked away and left us . Things had started getting worse on our side . We used to be comforted by the fact that they would fight them back but they had now left us all . At around the 10th or so everyone was minding his or her own life The day when all people went out of their homes , a group of attackers came from the coffee plantation that was in the valley below our home and everybody was gone . I was the only one left there . Thinking I could not die , I decided to stay there . And then my mum called me and told me that we were not going to die there alone that we should leave . However , some elderly men and women who were not capable of fleeing decided to stay and be killed there . <EOS>
We left running and reached a small forest that was slightly below our home . Then we heard the perpetrators in our cattle we had left home . They hacked them and the people we left home . I heard them hacking them [ the elderly people they had left home ] . We hid in a bush near home because they were already coming near us . First they hacked the men and meanwhile , we run to the sector 's offices at the Ntarama church . But even as we were running , we heard some of them behind us saying , "@ They passed here . There they are . @" And others entered the bush to search for us but luckily they found properties such as suitcases , bags and many others that people had hidden there . We heard them telling each other , "@ Hey ! I discovered some treasures here . @" So as they were concentrating on what they found we found a way to the sector in Ntarama at the church and that 's how we managed to survive that day . In fact , that was the day the war in Nyamata toughened because all the survivors fled to the schools . That is the day they killed my mum and dad and all the people who had hid home . They killed around 20 people . We preceded to the sector . When we reached at the sector ... at the school ... sorry , at Ntarama church . <EOS>
It had heavily rained . It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and it was getting dark . People were coming and going . Some were saying they were going to Kigali but they still would be killed on their way and the ones who had managed to survive would come back . Others went to the Ntarama church because there were some people who had been able to survive there for some days . In general , things were so scary . So I told my older sister whom we had run together , " Let 's not spend the night here , it does n't look safe here . How can we sleep here ? @" And then some policemen came and called some of the people who were there . They asked the people there , "@ What is the noise all about and why are you fleeing ? @" They replied , " We are fleeing from the Hutu . They want to kill us . @" Then the policemen said , "@ Calm down , it is over now . Gather up in one place there in the church so that we ensure your security . @" <EOS>
So again I told my sister , " Hope you have heard what the policemen said . I guess you can guess what will be next . You will see if those who will spend the night here will survive until tomorrow . I told her , "@ Let us go to the schools , we immediately left and went to the schools . Just after we left , they threw grenades at the Ntarama church . They killed everybody ; the survivors are handicapped today . Anyway , we continued and went to the school . At that time , the only safe hide out was at the school . For those who managed to survive Nyamata or anywhere else in the whole of Bugesera , the only hideout was at the school . We went and spent the night at the school . We used to spend the night there , and during the day we would go loitering in the swamps but we had never slept there because the Interahamwe used to go home at around 4 o'clock and we would go behind them and go back to the school . <EOS>
While we were at the school after 3 days , came a certain group of attackers called ‘ Simusiga ’ [ meaning I can not leave him [ the Tutsi ] behind ] . It was on the 15th of April 1994 . The group of attackers came in many buses . Sometimes they used to come and when they were pushed back , they would go back saying that the Inyenzi were in the swamp and that they had guns . Actually two of Habyarimana 's soldiers [ the Presidential Guard ] had come to kill us and two of the resistors took their guns and used them to defend themselves . Whenever the Interahamwe came towards the swamp they would hear the guns and then they would say there are Inyenzi in the swamps . So they went and called for the buses . You remember the attack of Nyanza ? The buses , which came are the one that came to kill in Bugesera . That was the day I was hacked . When those buses reached Nyanza , they found that they [ the other Interahamwe ] were killing people . Therefore they said , " Keep on finishing the ones ; we are going to reinforce the Bugesera people . The buses came straight to the school building where we were hiding , they really killed many people only few were left . But for us who were near the swamp , that is where they found us . Some old people committed suicide saying that they survived the machetes of 1959 and that the machetes of 1994 could not kill them . They dived into the water and were taken away . People who committed suicide were more than those who were hacked . Others said , "@ Let us die like men . Committing suicide is a sin @"@ . One would say , "@ lets me go and hide . @" <EOS>
That day I went and hid in the bush that was near the swamp . I ran into the bush and immediately the Interahamwe ran after me . That day it had not rained . At around mid @-@ day , when the sun was shining bright , the Interahamwe came and killed many people . Even my cousin who was slightly older than me . But we were not hiding together ; I do n't know where she was hiding just near by , we also lost her . I found out that they hacked me ; I did not know when I was hacked . But I guess I was hacked at around 4 o'clock or ehh ... at around mid @-@ day . That is when they hacked me . Then I touched myself and saw blood . In my heart , I was wondering if it was possible that they had cut me and I was still alive . I always used to imagine how they would one day bring a machete and hack me . I did not know how I would react . They hacked me on the exact day I had thought about it . I was n't sure I should hide in a sorghum plantation . I just kept on running . <EOS>
At some point , I penetrated another bush where the perpetrators found me and started to hack me . I finally left that bush at around 6.00 o'clock in the evening when the perpetrators were gone and the villagers going home . Maybe it was when fresh air [ the wind ] blew on me that I gained back my consciousness and heard people moving around . Unknowingly , I started calling . But maybe those people thought that I was with perpetrators . Instead of coming close to see , they ran away . And a certain person came and said , "@ Oh no , Mudahogora has been hacked look at how she is hurt ! @" At that time people were running for his or her own life . <EOS>
When people would see you in such condition ... You can imagine what I was looking like , considering the way you see me now with these scars . I looked like a dead body with blood all over in the face . Others would say , " She is taking her last breath she has no life in her . @" <EOS>
I was with my sister 's child who was 3 years old and we had hid together in the bush . When I opened my eyes , I saw the child seated besides me . But he was not hurt at all . Actually they did nothing to him although he later on died . I was the only one who had remained with him but I could n't help him to get something to eat . He developed anemia and died ; he was sitting with eyes wide open just besides me . I watched him for a while , wondering what would happen to him . By chance , a merciful woman who lived in that area came and put him on her back and carried him away . <EOS>
I stayed there alone ; everyone had gone . No one could bother to carry me out of there . I tried both legs and found that I had some little strength left in them but they were injured . I knew when the wounds are still fresh ; it was possible to move around . The only risk was that I could suddenly fall due to over bleeding . So I tried walking and it worked . You can guess that by then , the pain had not started yet so I started running following them . I was avoiding to be left in the bush alone , so I took off . The people I was meeting were wondering how far I would be able to run . <EOS>
Everybody run , I was left behind . I remembered that when the Interahamwe came back and found you still alive , they had to finish you . I survived that day . I pulled my self up to the school buildings but all my brothers had fled to Gitarama . I was left with my older sister , the second born in our family . The rest had been killed...my third brother as well . So at the school there were still some survivors . They had seen how intense the war had become and they said that we should start sleeping in the swamp because in the school we would be found out and killed . The often used to come to the school and break down the pots we were using for cooking and take the mattresses and everything . <EOS>
When we reached there , there is a certain uncle of mine who said , "@ Look how injured she is , we can n't live her alone here . Because once they find her here they will simply finish her up in torture . So let 's take her . @" We used to have some Hutu neighbours whose houses were in the centre in a place called Bisigara . When the war became tough , those people went to help their fellow Hutu and left their houses covered with banana leaves on the doors . So that when perpetrators came they would not destroy those houses . Then my uncle said that they should carry me to one house of their houses [ belonging to the Hutu ] where there was a banana leaf on the door , no one would enter there . He said God would take care of the rest . That is how it happened ; they took me there and the rest of the people in the school had all left and went to hide in those houses that were still remaining [ the houses with banana leaves ] . They used to sleep in those houses , although they were very scared that they might come and kill them . <EOS>
In that house there were other Tutsi who used to come and hide in it . They would spend the whole day in the swamp and the night in those houses . I was lucky I had other people with me . I used to spend the day alone in that house . One day , they went to the swamp and in the evening they came back with my brother . They used to hide during the day in the swamp , and in the evening , after the Interahamwe 's leaving , my borther would bring me some sweet potatoes in a small bucket . But he would go back after because he never used to sleep in those houses . He used to sleep in another place called Bitera . After a few days , they left and never came back . But within a short time , there came a certain Interahamwe who used to work as a gardener at home doing part @-@ time jobs . He married a lady in the neighbourhood . <EOS>
So he came in . I do n't know why he came ; maybe he had come to loot . Because he knew that house , he came with other people and I heard them hit the door . My heart was beating very fast out of panic . My wounds had started rotting and there was pus all over . I felt so much pain ; it was beyond death . I was feeling stiff . I just thought of how he was going to hack me inside those wounds . He pushed the door where I was then said , "@ Oh my ! That is how you are looking now ? @" <EOS>
Anyway I do not know the kind of God that worked wonders in him ; he never hurt me . Instead he went and brought me some juice . I could not hold anything . So , he held it for me and I swallowed big sips ; I had spent weeks without eating anything . Later he told me that he is going to get me some drugs . Three days after he left the RPF [ Inkotanyi ] troops came . I only saw him on that day , the people who inhabited that area too . Then I started wondering if maybe the people who used hide in that house saw the Interahamwe entering the house . In fact , when the Inkotanyi troops came , they first passed into the swamp and told them to cross over to Nyamata . That was the reason why they never came back to those houses . They immediately went where they were told to go . As they were living , they told the Inkotanyi that they were some of their people who are terribly injured but still alive . They told them we were hiding in those houses . Then the Inkotanyi said , "@ No , that is none of your business , it 's our work . Just do what we are asking you to do . @" Therefore , that is how they left ; I could n't see them anywhere that night . Then I said to myself , "@ All people have died . I am the only one remaining . @" <EOS>
So the next morning the wife of the gardener came to me and said , "@ Do you know what happened ? All the Interahamwe are gone and the Inkotanyi have come . @" I said , "@ Do n't say that ! Everybody has died and you are saying that the Interahamwe are gone . @" Then she explained to me , "@ No , they did not die . They just took them . @" Then she asked me if she should carry me to the roadside ... because there were other injured people , who were actually more injured than me [ on the road ] . She said , "@ You should join others and not remain behind alone . @" I accepted and she walked me to the road . I spent the night there but they did not come that night . However , they came the following morning at around 10.00 o'clock . Then they asked , "@ Is anybody in here ? @" That lady replied , "@ Yes . @" When they saw us they were very shocked at how injured we were . @" <EOS>
She ran away because her husband 's relatives wanted to kill her . Then all the Hutus had ran away towards Kibungo ... Kibungo sector ; I do n't know if you know it or hear about it . Therefore , that is when she came and asked me if I was aware of what had happened . Meanwhile , I thought everybody had died and that I was the only survivor . She asked me , "@ Why are you still here ? @" "@ What do you expect me to do ? @"@ , I replied Then she told me that the Inkotanyi took up the rest to Nyamata . "@ Nobody is remaining in this sector . Even the Interahamwe are running way . @" She assured me . Then I told her that I was not able to join them . She suggested to help me walk up to the road . "@ The Inkotanyi will never see you if you remain here @"@ , she said . It was in the evening beginning to get dark ; it was some minutes passed six p.m. Then she said , "@ I guess they will n't come at this time because it is late , but they may come in the morning . Make sure they find you there . @" Then she helped me walk up to a certain house . In that house I found several other kids , who were in the worst condition compared to me ; some were dying , others did n't have legs and could n't move . Others had started rotting from there . In brief , when I reached there , I seemed to be the strongest around . Yet I too was already desperate that my arms had started rotting ; they were weak , I could n't lift an arm to any angle . It took us about ... about four hours to get there . Then we heard people walking around , asking if there could be anybody inside the house . They hit the door and came in . They first saw me because I was the only one who was in better conditions than the others because my legs had not been hacked . Others were horribly injured . Some were hacked around the neck , on the legs , on the head and the arms as well . Two of them were dying due to weeks of hunger and thirst , since those dead bodies lying around . Then he asked if there was anybody who could try and join others . But later he realized that no one was able to walk . Then he asked me if I could try and walk but I said , "@ no I can n't @"@ . And then he sent that lady to Nyamata to bring some people and stretchers to carry us . But when she left , she did not come back . She was afraid of her husband ; he was a Hutu and a perpetrator . Actually she was praying she would find a way to join her people , she did not have anywhere to pass . <EOS>
The soldiers did not spend much time there because they were looking around for those who were seriously hurt and were unable to move , and that day we spent the night there . They were meant to help the people who were in the swamp , people were asking for water , but I was not of any help to them . The following day they fortunately came to rescue us starting from the badly hurt ones . They went picking up all the casualties , they gathered all of us and divided us into different groups according to our condition . They then carried us at Nyamata hospital where they were taking all casualties . When I arrived there at Nyamata , we found life had changed . You could not recognize anyone ; the only person I knew was my brother but he also later on joined the army . When Inkotanyi reached Nyamata all young men joined the army . <EOS>
I stayed in the Hospital , they treated me but I was in a lot of pain because my bone was badly broken , the sores were rotten they were about one month old so they had to clean it , give us medicine and dress the wounds . Then after two months we got well and I continued to live in Nyamata . So many people were passing by but I could not find any of my relatives , all my aunts who were there had been killed . I started thinking of what to do , and where to go . There was one lady I used to know , she was still with her mother and brother , and then she invited me to stay with her and said that they will see how things would turn out . <EOS>
We stayed together for a while then in July people started going back to their homes , I was asking myself what I would do next . I really needed to know news from my brother but found from people that he had joined the army because he was told that I was dead . But my aunt was also living there , my older sister used to live with her . She died before the war , and we all went to Rwampara to mourn her . The whole family came to bury Katumba , I was with my brother , but he went back and I stayed there . I went on Tuesday and the President died on Wednesday . I had just spent one night then the war started . The whole family was there , waiting to end the mourning ... So I decide to come to Kigali to see if there could be any survivor I can see since in Bugesera there was none . There was one man who had come from Bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at Rwampara , I found that one of my aunts was still there . That is when I started gaining some hope since at least I was getting someone to stay with . <EOS>
We stayed together until she died in the year 2000 . We lived together until that time and a few of my cousins were also there . I was able to find some people who had survived . My life went on like that . I think that is all about my life during Genocide . <EOS>
Can you continue telling us even the life after the Genocide and who did you live with ? <EOS>
When I went to see her , she had thought no one had survived . She was surprised to see me and although she saw how I had changed , she was happy that at least I was still alive . She asked me if there could be anybody else who survived and I told her that there was none . The time the Inkotanyi saved us . One of the soldiers said , "@ The Hutu do not really have any sham ; how could they dare hack a halfcaste person ! @" He said that after seeing how I was looking like ; my hair was overgrown . He could n't believe how they dare such crime . So I lived with my aunt who had a daughter . Her grandson who is a soldier later on came with his wife and we all stayed together . Then I went to live in Kacyiru together with my cousin 's spouse ; we met by chance and she told me that she did not know anyone in the family had survived and she could not continue to live alone . She asked me to go and live with her . At that time , people used to make decision at the spur of the moment . We went together but she got sick and died after some time . I then went back to Kimihurura to live with my aunt ; we later on shifted in the neighbourhood of ‘ Chez Lando ’ restaurant where she owned her own house . After sometime she also died and life went on ... I went to AVEGA and asked them for a house to live in , and I was lucky they gave me one . There were some children who were my relatives I brought in and we continued to live together up to now , that is how I am living . <EOS>
Did you continue to study after the Genocide ? <EOS>
After the war I did not continue to study . I spent most of my time at the hospital treating this hand as it was still paining me . Dr Nyaruhirira was on an attachment in South Africa . He came back and he is the one who treated me and I got well . Later on , I tried to run after the organization ‘ Kanyarwanda ’ , they were the ones who had taken me there and I was operated ; they changed the position of my arm bone it was not shaped like this . Then later on , those children had no one to look after them , so that is why I did not go back to school . <EOS>
Q ... <EOS>
Meanwhile , I got a job at "@ ACRG Mpore @" [ it is an association ] . I was earning some little money , it was enough for me to feed those children . Afterwards their uncle who came from abroad took them . Then I gave birth to my own child , she is now two years old . <EOS>
You have told us how you lived before the war , how you were treated in the society due to your ethnic or things like that ... what do you think is the difference between @: life before the war [ genocide ] and life after the war ? <EOS>
There is a difference . Because before the war people were scared . Wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation . Maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing . But in general , there is a big difference . Life nowadays is not the same as that before the war . <EOS>
Do you try to live with all types of people or do you feel closer to certain people ? Do believe you can live with all people or there are only a certain type of people you can live with . I mean people you can discuss the issues related to the genocide . Can you discuss genocide issues with anybody ? <EOS>
Of course not . Sincerely , you can not discuss genocide problems ... that problem ... a problem you share with someone else , you can not talk about it with someone you do n't share it . There are those you fell free with because you have the same problems , but ... for example @: the way I tell it to a survivor who was here in Rwanda is not the same as the way I tell it to a person who came from exile . I can tell my story to a survivor because I know we have something in common . It is like talking to someone you do n't share the same language , it is never the same as talking to that one you have it in common...this is just an example . <EOS>
What do you think about the families of those who murdered your family ? Do they try to show you any ... I am asking you this because I would like us to talk about unity and reconciliation . Is there any way you collaborate with the families of those who killed your people , to the extent where you can talk with them ? <EOS>
What do you mean by families of those people who killed mine ? I do n't know them . <EOS>
What do you think about unity and reconciliation ? <EOS>
I simply consider it as an impossible issue . How can one reconcile with a person who ... well , since there is no alternative , if he comes to you and ask for forgiveness you may forgive him . It is the same as those who say that , in Gacaca courts people admit their crimes and then are forgiven . But do you think they say it from the bottom of their hearts or is it so they may be forgiven ? That is why for me unity and reconciliation is impossible . <EOS>
There is a new Government policy of asking the survivors to go round in the prisons and sensitize the killers to admit what they did and report themselves . Do you support that idea ? <EOS>
Never , I can not handle it ! I can not manage to do that ; I am a 100 % against it . <EOS>
Let 's go back a bit before the genocide . Some people we met told us that there was an ethnic problem in schools , everywhere ; did you face the same problems ? <EOS>
Yes it was there and it was brought by the authorities . You could n't expect good result when you tell the Hutu to stand up and after Tutsi to do the same , for what purpose ? We were asking ourselves what was all that for ? And our parents used to tell us that they were survivors of Hutu persecutions in the previous years . They always used to complain about it . <EOS>
... did you see any changes after 1990 or were things the same ? <EOS>
That is when things got worse , the time the Inkotanyi attacked . That is the time people started joining Inkotanyi . I forgot to tell you that my brother had wanted to join the RPF , they caught him while he was in Ngenda and put him in prison after seriously striking him . For them joining the Inkotanyi was a big mistake and that would make them harass the families [ of the young people who would try to or manage to join the RPF ] . <EOS>
Was your family ever harassed ? <EOS>
He was not lucky ; he was caught among the ones who were confined for a long period . <EOS>
How was the situation at home after he was caught ? <EOS>
Of course it changed ; for days , soldiers kept coming home investigating on dad , saying that he is the one who had sent him . In our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by Tutsi , there was no Hutu among them . So these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things . Despite that , the genocide was later on generalized . <EOS>
Still in the 90s , political parties were created , such as CDR and MRND...did that affect you in your area or in your schools ? Could you explain to us ? <EOS>
Ça s'est passé comme partout , celui qui n'était pas dans le MRND était persécuté mais cela ne nous empêchait pas d' aller où l' on voulait . Même si on ne se sentait à l' aise nulle part , personne n'allait quand même là où il détestait . Mais après on se disait @: « Tant pis s'ils me tuent mais je ne serai pas membre de leur parti . » Tout ceci créait un mauvais vent . C'était ça le multipartisme , tous les partis étaient en conflit . It was similar everywhere . Those who were n't MRND members were persecuted but that did not stop us from being members of the parties we chose . Even though there was so much tension , we were not going to pretend and be where we hated to be . Our attitude was @: "@ If they are going to kill me because that , let it be so . @" There was a lot of tension . <EOS>
Going back to just after the genocide ... What do you think of the new program that releases prisoners who acknowledge their crimes and that reintegrates them in the society ? Do you think it will help in the process of unity and reconciliation ? <EOS>
When I think about that I find that it impossible . I think it will result into something worse . I do n't know if my opinion is similar to what others think . When I hear that I have goose pimples all over my body ; so I try to ignore it . Can you imagine someone who has killed your people coming to live with you ? Do you think it will be safe ? <EOS>
You told us that your dad was from Ruhengeri . Were they neighbours with your mum or your mum came from a different place ? <EOS>
They were all living together . In fact all the people of Ntarama were somehow related , they came together and lived together that way . <EOS>
Did they intermarry ? <EOS>
Yes , they came when they were grown @-@ ups . <EOS>
Do you know how they were killed ? <EOS>
Yes of course , I think I 've told you about it ... I partially said it . We were together at home and they told us to escape and leave them behind . They did not want us to die as handicapped people ... They wanted to stay...as soon as we left , the perpetrators came and started killing . We even heard them screaming from where we were . <EOS>
Did any of your brothers or sisters survive ? <EOS>
I lost two brothers in Kabgayi . Another one died at the front line and I remained with one ... We were two to survive . He died in the war in Congo . We had only seen each other twice . He was coming to see me when he died . He died straight away . The others were killed while looking for a place where to hide like everyone else . They were hacked to death . <EOS>
Did you manage to exhume and rebury your people in Ntarama ? <EOS>
I have never been there . The day they were burying them I was here . I knew my parents ' bodies were at home . I went there once to bury them and I was so surprised...it had been announced on the radio , it was in 1995 that people had gone to Ntarama for burials ... When I went to bury them , I did not find them there . People told me they had been told to gather all bodies and to put them together at Ntarama ... <EOS>
