My name is Odette Umulisa , daughter of Matthias Kamuhanda and of Yulida Nyiramatama . I am from Mabanza commune , in a place called Rubengera , in Rubengera sector , in Mataba cell . We were many in my family ... we were many . I had 4 brothers called Alfred , Edouard , Uwitonze and Shumbusho . Shumbusho is still alive today . I had one little sister called Ngirabakunzi . But she did n't ... no ne was ab ... she did n't survive . Only my brother Shumbusho , my mother and I survived in my family . My father also passed away . <EOS>
I would say it all started when I was still very young . I remember how when I was in primary school , they used to tell us to stand every year and then they 'd ask us to tell them about our ethnicity . I remember how the first time they told us to stand up , they told the Hutus to stand up and then the Tutsis , I was in Primary III and that was the first time I was seeing something like this . I did n't know what tribe I was and thus I remained seated . The rest stood up , first the group of the Hutus , then the Tutsis . Our teacher was also a neighbour and she knew my tribe as she knew my father ; he asked me why I did not stand up and I asked her why I should have stood up and she asked me @: "@ Do n't you know you 're Tutsi ? @" Then I stood up ; I remember how my friends started mocking me saying @: "@ So you 're also Tutsi ? @" That 's how I states learning things about ethnicity . <EOS>
I later on went home . I remember meeting dad on my way home . I was very sad and I asked him why my friends had laughed at me telling me I am a Tutsi . "@ What does being Tutsi mean ? @" I asked him . He told me @: "@ I do n't know how to explain that to you ... that 's just the way things are ... @" He told me he would one day explain to me as I needed to know that I was actually Tutsi . He said he also found things that way ... When I got home , I asked mother for more explanations . She then told me @: "@ In Rwanda , there are Twas , Hutus and Tutsis . This is not something that should make you feel sad or cry . You are Tutsi . @" She went ahead and told me about my grandfather whom I never met . She explained to me that the reason why I did n't meet him was because there were some bad people who believed the Tutsi was a bad person . She told me it was n't true and we are all the same and I should never believe such a thing . <EOS>
It went on like that and they used to tell us to stand up every year . I finally got used to it and stop feeling like being a Tutsi was an issue . I remember a conversation I had with mom while I was in primary IV . I wanted more explanations and she then told me what exactly happened to my grandfather . She told me how in 1959 , they came and took her dad , she was 16 and a mature person . She told me he was taken away together with other members of his family . She told me how she followed him to the car where they tied his hands and put him in with other people . She told me she followed that car throughout her neighbourhood as they were picking up everyone whose name was on their list . <EOS>
He told me about other members of her dad 's family who were taken away at thwat time as well . She told me how they never found out what exactly happened to her father but that he was taken by some Hutus secondary school students who told them how he was killed . She told me they threw them in a pit in Ruhengeri but I do n't know the exact location in Ruhengeri . Then came the multiparty system in 1990 . Things went wrong in our area . But I was n't there for long , I moved to Gisenyi where I lived with some of mother 's relatives . She is from Gisenyi . In Gisenyi , things were worse than in Kibuye . Maybe in Kibuye people acted as though everything was fine , but in Gisenyi , they were doing it in the open . They used to tell us that they 'd one day kill us . But I thought that was impossible . Mother had explained to me that my grandfather was killed because he was a Tutsi , saying he used to go the royal court but I did n't believe that was the reason he was killed . I felt like maybe there 's something else he did that made them kill him . I did n't believe that one could be killed just because they were Tutsi . But in 1990 , things were so bad in Gisenyi that I started seeing that it was true , the were killing the ‘ Abagogwes ' [ a Tutsi clan in the North of Rwanda ] ; so I could see where things were heading , I even realized that one day it would probably reach me or any other Tutsi . <EOS>
I left Gisenyi [ she starts crying ... ] and when to see my father after a long time . That was in 1992 ... I had n't seen him in a long time as I had been living with my mother 's relatives . I was a grown up and him and I had a serious conversation . He told me to visiting him as things were going to be very bad soon . "@ Maybe I will never see you again my daughter @" he said while I was about to leave . I told him @: "@ We will see each other again , dad ! The Inkotanyis are fighting now and hopefully they 'll win the war before anything wrong happens to us . @" I only went back home 5 months later and we would talk about what was going on . I talked with my brothers , the one who followed me was only a year younger than me . Edouard told me @: "@ Odette , things are going to be really bad around here and I want to leave . Since you live in Gisenyi , I 'd like you to get me a way of fleeing to Zaïre [ current Congo DRC ] because we will all be killed . @" I told him we were going to be okay but I promised him to look for a way as I had friends in Goma . "@ I 'll find you a way to reach Goma and then go to the battle field . Maybe one of us will survive that way @"@ , I said . <EOS>
He insisted that I assure him that I was going to do it for him and I promised I 'd do so . I went back to Gisenyi and there was a woman called Immaculée . I told her about my 2 young brothers , still strong , who needed to flee the country , I told her I needed her help . She told me she was going to help me do that . I told Edouard to get ready . I went back to Kibuye and told my dad about it , he said it would be great if it 's possible to get my brothers out of the country so that we would not all be killed . He was desperate , as though he already knew he was going to die . I was home on a Monday and I remember telling Edouard to get read and join me on Friday . That was in 1993 . He got ready and found me in Gisenyi with another young man who was his very good friend although he was Hutu . He said he 'd follow him in exile . He said he was not just going to watch them kill my brother , he said he did n't want to survive him . He was called Munyensanga . <EOS>
I remember how surprised I was when I saw Munyensanga , wondering if they were going to go together . I tried reasoning him saying that Edouard was fleeing because they were targeting us and we knew they 'd kill us even though it had n't happened yet . He said that if Edouard was going to leave , he 'd go with him . I went and talked to Immaculée and she told me everything was ready for them to leave on Saturday . A friend of mine called Alivera came and told me she did n't think it was a good idea to let them cross the border . She said that although Munyensanga had n't said exactly when she was leaving , she had told them she was fleeing with Edouard . She advised me not to let them go as they 'd know I sent my brother away with Munyensanga and they were going to kill me . "@ His family will not be happy to hear that you sent them to the Inkotanyis @"@ , she said . I ended up not sending Edouard , I was selfish and I sent him back to Kibuye . I told him it would be too dangerous for me when they find out . He begged me to take him to Immaculée but he refused . Edouard went back to Kibuye and looked for a way to leave from there but never succeeded . That was the last time I saw him , he went to Kayove after that , he was scared to go back home and he went to hide in Kavoye where mom is from , in a place called Nkurutu . He went to hide there and the war occurred before he went back home and that 's where he was killed . <EOS>
Later on , Munyensanga 's family found out I almost sent their son to the Inkotanyis , although it was n't really me who had wanted to send him , they put a lot of pressure on me . A military man who was from home got involved , they took me to the police station and questionned me about my involvement with the Inkotanyis . I told them I did n't know them and probably due to the fact that I was still very young , I was only 17 , they did n't keep me there for long . I was at the police station for only 3 days with other young people who were in school in Congo who had been arrested as well as many other people they had captured in Gisenyi . Among them was the Manager of Sulfo Gisenyi [ a cosmetic industry ] . I have met him , he 's still alive . He survived . They ended up releasing me and some of my friends . But in my mind I knew I was going to become some sort of an outcast after having been in jail . And that 's exactly what happened , I was no longer free to move around as I wanted to . Whenever I 'd reach a roadblock - Gisenyi was full of roadblocks then because things were very tensed , we were almost in 1994 - I 'd ... I decided to just remain inside the house . I never even went back home to see dad . I was too scared that Munyensanga 's family would harass me or that I 'd even be imprisoned for wanting to help Edouard flee . <EOS>
The tension continued in 1994 . The genocide started when I was away from home , I was in Kigali . I had been fleeing the war for sometime then as people knew I had wanted to send my brother in the Inkotanyis ' army and it was very bad being called an Inkotanyi then . I came to live with a lady called Maria who was a family friend . The war started while I was living at her house . When the war broke up , it was like a nightmare ... It was like a nightmare because even though they used to talk about it , I never thought it could actually happen ... I did n't know people could change and become wolves . Maria told me that the President had died the previous night and that the war had started . She told me that I needed to pack my things in the morning and leave her home . I asked why , what had happened ... "@ Do n't you know that the President died and was killed by the Tutsis ? So you need to get out of my house ! @" <EOS>
I begged her and told her that she was the only one who knew I was Tutsi because she knew my dad and that no one was going to find out unless she told them . I remember her younger sister 's child was at home and he @/@ she had a fine nose ... I remember telling her how my nose was n't even as fine as his or hers and nobody could think I am Tutsi unless she reported me . She refused and demanded that I leave her house . We were 3 ladies who were living with her , one of them was called Mélanie , she was married but I heard they were separated with her husband ... she was married to a white man . She had also come to visit him . There was also another lady called Maria ... She told me @: "@ Go ! @" I asked her where I should go and she told me I should just go but she told me I just needed to leave her house . She said if she kept me in her house , she 'd be taking the risk of being killed as well . There was nowhere to pass and I did n't even know Kigali well enough . <EOS>
She chased me and I remember heading to ... There was nowhere else to go and I went to hide in the toilets at her house , at the back side . I remember meeting a lady they were calling Mama Giramata there . She was surprised to see me and she said @: "@ So , you 're also a Tutsi ? @" "@ Yes ! @" I replied . Then I asked her if she thought they were really going to kill us . She told me that she knew I had a white boyfriend and I should start asking God for forgiveness if I had been involved in some sin . She said we were certainly going to die . <EOS>
She also suggested that I go and ask Jules to help me flee . But I felt like ... I do n't if it was due to my young age or if it was that I was n't very intelligent but I thought ... I told her I did n't want him and I 'd prefer that he takes me to my dad if he had the ability to do so because I really wanted to see dad and Edouard , I wanted to ask Edouard for forgiveness as I felt like I should have let him leave and even taken the risk to be killed for him to be saved . <EOS>
Where exactly where you in Kigali ? <EOS>
I was in Rugunga , in Kigali . That 's where I was when the war broke up . Mama Giramata told me @: "@ Do n't say you 're going to Kibuye ! Which way would you use ? Pray and ask God for forgiveness . I left her in the toilets , went and told Maria @: "@ Please Maria , do n't chase me ! Where will I go ? @" She said @: "@ I am from Doctor Jean 's house and they told me they 've killed them . So you and Mélanie should go to Doctor 's house and look of there 's anyone who survived . I was there and I saw blood but I was n't able to check inside if there 's any survivor . @" I think she lied to me and she had been too afraid to enter . I do n't think she entered . <EOS>
Mélanie and I went to Jean 's home , that 's when I understood that it was over . For the first time , I saw people who had been killed , everyone had been killed , even the children had been killed . I remember an 8 year old child who was laying next to his or her mother , I then understood that it was over . We got inside the house looking for something we could use to cover them but there 's nothing as everything had been looted . We left Jean 's house ... Mélanie was very scared , she told me she was n't sure she 'd survive or if I would neither . She asked me she wanted me to choose among her many clothes the ones I liked when we get home , she said I could wear them if I happened to survive . I laugh at myself whenever I remember that because when we got to Maria 's house , I went among her clothes and chose the nice ones and tied them into a shirt and we left . We went to a quarry that was in Rugunga . We used paths between houses and we passed dead bodies all over the place . Mélanie was a lot more afraid than I was . I felt I was strong . We went and sat there . <EOS>
In the evening , we left the place for Hélène 's house . Hélène was Maria 's younger sister . We begged her to hide us and she said she had no place where to hide us as everyone had become so wicked . She told us to go and sit in the kitchen . She took good care of us til evening then she told us to leave as she had no place where to hide us . She told Mélanie to go back to Maria since she 'd live with her for a long time and beg her again to hide us . We went back there but it was n't easy to find a way to use . We came out at the neighbours ' and found that they 'd already caught other people and they took Mélanie and I together with them . There were many other people I did n't know , I did n't know many people in that area as I had only been there for 3 days . The war started when I had been there for 3 days , I was just a visitor . They took us to the Kigali Sports Club [ Cercle Sportif de Kigali ] in Rugunga . There 's a woman who was with us whom I 'll always remember . She had a very small baby , about 3 months old . On our way , we met a friend of hers and she begged her to take the baby with her . She refused saying that she could n't take the baby as our last day had come [ the Tutsis ' last day ] . I also remember that Mélanie kept reassuring me all the way . They took us to a place that was kind of flat , the ‘ cercle ’ is actually kind of flat . <EOS>
They started to shoot , both children and adults were begging for pity in vain . Some children were asking for forgiveness and even promised never to be Tutsis again in vain . I was so frightened I fell down ! Many people fell on me , Mélanie included . But Mélanie did n't ... About an hour later , when everyone was dead , I heard Mélanie 's voice calling @: "@ Odette ! Odette ! Are you still alive ? » I replied that I was still alive . She helped me remove the corpses that were on top of me . She had been very wounded by the bullets . She got me out of there and said @: "@ We do n't have anywhere else to go and it 's almost morning and when it 's daytime , they 'll find out that we 're still alive . @" She suggested that we go backt o Hélène 's . We went back to Hélène 's house and entered the kitchen and sat there , they did n't used to lock . Mélanie was bleeding very much throughout and she was so frightened that she was trembling . We stayed there until Hélène came in the morning to make some tea . She was surprised to find us still alive . She asked us about the rest of the people and we told her everyone else had been killed . She said if we remained there , we 'd still be killed anyway . She said we should stay there until she came back and she went to look for someone who would agree to hide us . We ate . Mélanie was very tired . Hélène did n't find anyone willing to hide us . She told us to make the effort to go and sit in some bush at the querry despite the fact the Mélanie was so weak , until she finds a better place where to hide us . In the evening , she took us there . As we were sitting there , Mélanie told me she was very tired . <EOS>
She told me she wanted to go back to her home in Butare as she had no hope of living anyway . She said she could try and pretend to be a Hutu as she had a Hutu identity card , she thought she could say she 'd been wounded out of a mistake . Mélanie said goodbye and I never saw her again . I do n't know what happened to her after that . Hélène came back and found Mélanie had left . She took me to a certain lady in Rugunga , not far from where I was . The lady told me she was going to hide because Hélène asked her to do so , she said I was safe with her as she saw the Interahamwes regularly . There was another child hiding there , a very young child of about 7 years . It had been about 2 months since the war started ... sorry about 2 weeks . I had n't known her for long , I met her slightly before the war started . She was called Micheveux . <EOS>
I lived there with that child for about ... probably 3 weeks . The child 's family was living not far from there , they were stil alive but they knew their last day was n't far . One evening , Micheveux told me , "@ Ode , I am going to die . @" I asked her why she was saying that and who she thought could find us there and kill us . "@ I am smelling blood , I feel like I am smelling blood , I am going to die . @" I told her to calm down and that she was going to be okay . That evening , Micheveux went back to her home , the Interahamwes came and took them all . They were many children in that family , about 8 of them . Only one child survived . I continued hiding in the same house but at some point there started feeling like the war was never going to end and I represented a risk to their own lives as anyone who was found hiding a Tutsi person then would be tortured if not killed . Thérèse finally told me she could no longer hide me as people in the neighbourhood knew I was still alive . Therefore , they were looking for me . <EOS>
She told me I needed to find another place where to hide . I remember leaving her house one day in the morning , it was raining heavily and she told me to go back to Hélène 's house . Hélène told me that the fact she asked me to leave the day meant they 'd all seen me and they 'd soon be looking for me . It was too dangerous for her to hide in those conditions . She told me to go to the quarry , there was a man who was giving out identity cards for those who had lost theirs . She told me not to show him my ID and to just tell him that I was a Hutu and that I had lost my ID . I walked up in the day without trying to hide myself . When I reached Kiyovu , there was a roadblock ; it was raining heavily . They stopped me and asked me where I was from . I told them I lived at Maria 's and they said they did n't know me . I told me I had been sent and they said I was lying to them and I was a Tutsi . I denied it and told I was n't a Tutsi at all and it 's just that I had been sent . One of them had a gun . He told me @: "@ Listen ! Tell me the truth if you are a Tutsi . I promise not kill you if you acknowledge you are one . But if you say you 're a Hutu and I find out you are n't , I will n't have mercy on you ! @" He asked me for my ID and I got it out of my pocket and gave it to him . Then I said to him @: "@ I am sorry for lying to you , I am a Tutsi . But please have mercy on me as you 've just promised . @" <EOS>
He looked at it then said @: "@ You 're an Inyenzi , go and sit there ! @" I went and sat next to 3 young men and an old man who looked handsome . I do n't know but ... they used to say the Tutsis had a long nose , a long face and that 's the way he looked . He had all the Tutsi features they used to describe . I kept staring at him , hoping that he 'd ask them to have mercy on me but he did n't say anything . Then one of them ... the man with a gun moved backwards , I think he want to kill me because he stood behind me and loaded his gun . I was so terrified I did n't even ask ... I panicked . Then his friend said @: "@ Are you going to kill her here ? We do n't even have a hoe to bury her . If you kill her here , she 'll rot here and start smelling bad . Where will we put her ? @" He then said @: "@ Just leave her , there 's a car that went to Nyamirambo to bring Tutsis , the Presidential Guardians [ GP ] are the ones driving it . Let them come and take her with others . @" I just sat there in the rain . At some point , a passerby I had never met before . He knew that Interahamwe . He asked , "@ Why did you get that girl to sit there ? @" He replied to him that I was an Inyenzi . He was like , "@ You guys are actually killing everyone on the pretext that they are Inyenzis ! @" His reply was that what he meant was that I was a Tutsi and that they were expecting a car from Nyamirambo that will be having Tutsis in it and I would go with them . <EOS>
He came back to me and asked , "@ Where are you from ? @" I told him I am from Kibuye . He asked me where exactly in Kibuye and I replied , "@ In Rubengera . @" He then exclaimed , "@ Where in Rubengera ? Whose daughter are you ? Whose daughter are you ? @" I told him our place is called Ruvumbu , on your way to Mutaba . I told him that was called Matthias Kamuhanda . He asked me if I knew a Protestant pastor called Nzabahimana in Kibuye . I told him I knew him . He went to talk to his friend , I do n't know what he told him because they were n't near me . Then he came back and told me , "@ I asked him to let you go and so you can leave but do n't go where tou were going ... Where were you going by the way ? @" I explained to him that I was going to look for an identity card with a man who gives them out up there because I had been told that if I had one that said I was a Hutu , I would n't be killed . He told me that the person who told me that had lied to me and that the man would kill me . <EOS>
He told me to go back where I was coming from ... I went back to the quarry where Mélanie and I hid ourselves on the first day . I was in the same bush till evening then I went back to Hélène 's house to ask her to hide me once again or to help me get someone else to hide me . Hélène told me that she did n't have anyone or anywhere to send me to and that I was betrayed the day her own sister chased me out of her home . She said if her sister had kept me in her house , no one would have ever known my tribe . Then she said she was going to ask Thérèse to hide me yet again . Thérèse told her she could n't as her own mother was a Tutsi and her mom had her with a Congolese man and everyone knew that . Her other siblings had Tutsi fathers . She said she could n't take me in because if they found me in her house , they 'd kill us all . I went to Mama Olivier 's home , that 's where Hélène took me but again Mama Olivier was waiting for them to come and kill her as she was also a Tutsi . <EOS>
But she told me I could stay there with her and it was okay if they came and killed us together . I only stayed there for 3 days and then she asked one of her neighbours to kindly keep me because Mama Olivier herself was being hunted and they 'd certainly kill her if they found me in her house . She then took me to her friend 's home . I was there for about 2 days ... Hélène kept on pleading with Thérèse and she finally agreed to take me in with her again . By then , people in Rugunga had all been killed . Later on , the Inkotanyis kept on fighting and fighting . When they reached a place called Imburabuturo , people had toleave their homes for sometime . But when they came back to their homes , Thérèse told me that she was going to lock me in and if she ever came back , she would not keep me with her because things were really be bad then , she explained that they could even come on the next day searching in her house and find me there . I remember Hélène begging her to keep me with her and she said she had already helped me a lot despite the fact that she did n't know me and she could n't continue risking her life for me . She said she expected them to come soon and kill her siblings and her mother and she believed they 'd kill her as well . <EOS>
Then Hélène told me not to worry and that she was going to get someone else who could hide me . She left and came back saying that she found a benefactor old lady from Kibuye where I also come from and the latter understood my situation and she was willing to hide me . She directed me to that place , she told me to go and knock on the third gate . "@ She will hide you because I have already talked to her about you . @" When Thérèse came home , I told her to be patient with me as I had found someone else to hide me . I remember living Thérèse 's house at night . I went to Mama Sania the old lady 's house . But I did n't know the place very well and I knocked on someone else 's gate by mistake . They asked me where Iwas going and I told them I was looking for Mama Sania and he directed me properly . <EOS>
I went and knocked and they opened for me . I did n't know Mama Sania , the old lady and I mistakened her with the person who came to open for me . She told me she was n't the one and she went ahead and called her . The old lady came and asked me about myself , where I come from , ... Then she told me that despite the fact that she had promised Hélène to hide me earlier but she was not going to be able to as things had become really bad . She told me she was hiding many people in her home but she was n't sure they 'd still be alive the next day . I do n't know why despite all that I remained assured that I was going to survive . Bibi [ Mémé en Swahili ] then told me to leave her home . I told Mama Sania @: "@ Mama , have mercy on me and hide me please ! @" She refused and said I should leave . When she said so , I felt like it was over and I was going to die . But I was mostly sad that I was going to die without saying goodbye to my father and without asking Edouard to forgive me . I cried and then she asked me to come back . I was crying so much as I was leaving that she asked me to come back . She told me she was a Muslim , she believed in God and if she let me go and I got killed on the way , she believed God would ask her to give an account about me . She took me inside to a room inside her house and when I got in , I felt like the situation was hopeless ... I had been thinking that I was the only Tutsi that was still alive in Rwanda and then I found all these people who were hiding in that room . They were so many ! The one I always remember is a girl who was there . She never talked to me . They had really destroyed her , she had been raped and done her really bad things . There 's no other way to put it , she was rotten . She was bleeding daily . I tried talking to her in a way to reassure her that we were going to survive but she never used to reply . She had become numb . I prayed all the prayers I could think of asking God to heal her but ... she was in so much pain and she could n't eat . The old lady tried her best to help us but it was n't possible . <EOS>
Something that ... Something that really surprised me and made me wonder why people were so much against us is that one day Bibi went out , she used to walk around a lot . She met somebody who was dying of hunger . She brought him to us , the man was called Minani . We never used to get out . Bibi put the adults among us in charge of taking care of the injured and of the children . She brought the man called Minani and told me to take care of him . I approached him but he could n't talk as he was very hungry . I asked him his name and he said he was called Minani . I asked him where he was from and he told me he was a Burundian refugee , him and his family were being persecuted and he fled the war in Burundi . A few days later , when he started getting back some strength , he asked me how I got there and I told him I sought refuge there in an attempt to flee . He asked me if I was a Tutsi and I said "@ yes @"@ . His reply was that him on the other hand was Hutu and the fact that we had met in such a place was probably God 's way of showing us how we really have no reason to fight and that at the end of the day , we are all the same . <EOS>
I stayed at Mama Sania 's until the time the war was almost over . The Inkotanyis fought a lot and reached Kigali city and were not far from Rugunga . The war went on , there were gun shots all over the place and we fled the place as soon as we got a way out . At that time , there was no longer anyone asking for people 's identity cards and you could not tell who was a Hutu and who was a Tutsi , everyone was fleeing . We fled but the young girl I spoke about earlier was n't able to flee as her health state was critical . Later on , the Inkotanyis took us to Saint @-@ André [ a school in Kigali ] where they continued to protect us . Bibi remained behind with the casualties , among them was that girl . After the war , they told us all to go back home . When I got back , the girl was no longer there ... she passed away . Even Minani , they suffered so much . I think about them all whenever I remember the things that happened during the war , the hardships people went through ... the ones I myself experienced . I remember that girl and Mélanie more than my own siblings who passed away . I felt so bad especially because the girl and I never got to really talk . <EOS>
When the war stopped , I stayed at Mama Sania 's for a short time until the Inotanyis captured Kibuye as the war had n't yet stopped there . I knew I would one day go back there because I believed there had to be some survivors . I looked for a job in a European project , there were many of that kind at that time . I got a job and started working . Then I went home and there was no one , not even a single person and all the houses had been destroyed . The people I met told me how they were killed , that 's all told me . I came back to Kigali and went back to work . Then I was told that my aunts were still alive . I went to see them and found them , they married Hutu men . They told me that they had n't been able to help anyone survive , be it in my immediate family , be it in my dad 's bigger family but they said there could be some of my cousins and my little brother who survived although they did n't know exactly where they were . They told me Shumbusho was beaten and they left him thinking he was dead . They said someone told them he was in the Turquoise zone , among the children that were picked here and there . I asked the auntie who was saying it if she did n't know where he was and she said she did n't have a clue where he could be . I told my auntie called Chantal that I was going to leave my job and go to look for my uncle Mutabazi 's children as well as Shumbusho . I came back to Kigali and resigned , but my employers were very kind to me , they said they were n't going to let me resign but they were giving me some time off so I could look around for any potential survivor within my family . I first went to all orphanages looking for either Shumbusho , either Violette and Claudette , my uncle 's children . <EOS>
But I did n't see any of them for about 3 months ... for me 3 months seemed to be a very long time . I had given out my brother 's name and the organization Cocern in Gitarama told me they had a child called Shumbusho . I found very young children there . A one year old girl ran to me calling me ‘ mom ’ , she was called Mutoni . Maybe her mother and I looked alike , I do n't know what made her call me mom . The other children came to me , they thought she had found her mother . I explained to the ones who were old enough to understand that I was n't her mother . I carried her and headed towards the Management to find out if the child called Shumbusho was there . They asked me the names of the child 's parents . I told them father was called Matthias Kamuhanda and mother was called Yulida Nyiramatama . They went through the names of the children they knew and Shumbusho was a bright boy and he had given out those names , he was 7 . They told me he was alive but he had gone to school . It was a miracle and I felt like it was n't true even after they told me he was alive . I waited until noon when he came back from school . His school was n't far from the orphanage and he came at around 12 . When Shumbusho saw me , he became ... he was taken by surprise , he just stared at me , he did n't even come forward to say hi . I approached him and he looked so scared . <EOS>
The he asked , "@ You 're still alive ? @" I said yes . Then he asked me if there was any other survivor at home which I told him there was none . He asked me about Ngirabakunizi , our little sister because they followed each other . He asked again , "@ Even Ngirabakunzi is n't there ? @" I told him no , she was n't there either . He asked again , "@ Even dad ? @" I said yes , even him . He told me it was impossible , that dad was very strong and there was no way they could have killed him . "@ He must have fought and run . They did n't kill him @" he said . "@ No , dad is not alive . @" I told him . Then he run away . He run away from me very fast , he refused to approach me again ... I do n't know why ... maybe ... I do n't know why he did n't want to come near me . I never ask him about it . His guardians told me to go back home and leave him , they said it was still hard for him to accept it . I went back home and then I started working again . A nieghbour once came and told me Violette and Claudette were still alive as well . I was very happy and I felt like it was a miracle . I had some money and I remember going to buy beds and mattresses . I thanked Bibi for all she did for me and I told her I wanted to leave because I had found my younger brother and sisters and I did n't want to bother her with them . Bibi told me not to leave , she said she was going to take care of them just like she had been taking care of me . I insisted I wanted to leave and I asked her to help me find a house , I told her I could now afford paying a rent and taking care of them since I had a job . I told her she could continue helping me but I did n't want to continue bothering her . Bibi finally agreed to help me find a house . <EOS>
She got me a three bed roomed house . I had 3 beds made , one for Shumbusho as I intended to ask the people from the orphanage to give him to me and 2 others for Violette and Claudette . I got another leave and went to look for Violette and Claudette . I went back home to Kibuye and found out that the person who told me about them had lied to me . My aunt Chantal told me they killed them at the stadium . She told me she had not wanted to tell me about it as she could see how difficult it was for me . She said my uncle Mutabazi was injured at the stadium but left there while he was still alive . He went to her house and told her everyone was dead . He told her my dad got out of the stadium but they killed them all ... No one survived ! <EOS>
I still look at their mattresses today , I did n't use them ... Sometimes I feel like it is not true , as though they did n't die ... some days I feel like it 's impossible ... it 's impossible that so many people can die at the same time , as though they were maybe somewhere else but that they have n't died . But there 's nothing I can do about it , it is something I am starting to accept and I thank God that I have a good life today . I later on got married and I have 2 kids . Whenever I remember my siblings who died and even our neighbours , I feel very sad but when I look at my children , it gives me the desire to continue to live . They are my siblings and my children at the same time . <EOS>
Are you still with Shumbusho ? <EOS>
Yes , Shumbusho is still with me and I do my best to help him forget all the bad things he saw . But sometimes I get the impression that life is meaningless to him . Sometimes he looks so absent . But he is such a source of joy to me because I believe that even if our family was wiped out , God will give it back to us one day through Shumbusho . You 'd think dad called him Shumbusho ( meaning the substitute ) knowing that through him , we shall have a substitute to our family . <EOS>
How many children were you in your family ? <EOS>
We were ... the boys were 4 plus Shumbusho , that makes it 5 and my little sister Ngirabakunzi and I . <EOS>
Only you an Shumbusho survived ? <EOS>
Yes Shumbusho and I are the ones who survived . <EOS>
If we go back to 1994 ... can you remember exactly how you left Kibuye for Gisenyi ? Was it as a consequence of the war ? <EOS>
No , it was n't because of the war . I left home before the war started . I was brought up in Gisenyi because that 's where my mom was born . I was mainly brought up in her family . <EOS>
Did any of your neighbours in Gisenyi die when the Inkotanyis attacked in 1990 ? <EOS>
Not among our neighbours in Gisenyi . Not where I was living . But people I know of people who died in Kayove where mom was from . <EOS>
You told us your mom 's family and your cousins lived in Kayove . Who were you living with in Gisenyi ? <EOS>
I was living with mother 's cousin in Gisenyi . <EOS>
How did you end up in Kigali ? We did n't understand it well ... <EOS>
I had a white boyfriend . I used to come and visit him but I would also bring some things to sell . I would stay at Maria 's until I finish sellingmy things then I would go back home . <EOS>
Had you finished studying ? <EOS>
No , I had n't . I went back to school later on . <EOS>
You told us the war broke up when you had been in Kigali for 3 days , you also said that there 's a time you were with the child called Micheveux for about 2 weeks , I did n't quite undertand that part . <EOS>
Well , when I said 2 weeks , I also realized later on that I made a mistake . I spent about 2 weeks hiding together with Micheveux and that 's the time she one day told me she was convinced she was going to die . I asked her why and she told me she felt like she was smelling blood all over her body . I told her she was n't going to die , trying to reassure her . But it was as though she actually knew she was going to die because that 's the same day her whole family was taken away . Only a boy survived plus a girl who was in Butare . Michoveux died with them . <EOS>
Have you heard anything Giramata , the one you were hiding with at Maria 's ? <EOS>
Mama Giramata survived together with her husband and children . But I have never heard anything about Mélanie . I never saw her again after the day I was with her in the bush . <EOS>
Were Hélène and Maria sisters ? <EOS>
Yes Hélène was Maria 's younger sister . <EOS>
And Hélène kept on looking for ways to hide you ... <EOS>
Yes , she is the one who helped me to get all the people who hid me because I did n't know anyone else in Kigali apart from Hélène and her sister . Meaning that if Hélène did n't help me find all those people , I would not have survived . <EOS>
Did you feel like the times she 'd ask you to leave it was because maybe you were n't of any gain to her , maybe because you were n't giving her money or ... ? <EOS>
No , she did because she loved God , she did n't do it because I was giving her any money , not at all ! She used to tell me to leave as she went to look for someone who would be willing to hide me but it was not because she was ignoring or because I did n't have anything to give her . She did out of a good heart , I was n't even the only one she was helping . She used to take food to others in their hiding places , making sure her husband does n't see her doing so . <EOS>
Was she married ? <EOS>
Her husband was a killer . He killed some people . She even told me that if her husband had n't become a monster , she would have kept me in her home and that there was no point of keeping me there because he 's kill me ... I would n't survive even one night . Her husband used to spend all his time going to roadblocks and she did n't want to have my death on her conscience . If her husband had been a good man , she would have hidden me because it was on her heart . If everyone had been like Hélène and Mama Sania , the Tutsis in Rwanda would not have died and been wiped out . But Mama Sania is the one ... among all the people who hid me , she surpasses them all because she became like a parent to me . She told me , "@ Everything that 's said about the Tutsis and how wicked they are is not true , I am not a Tutsi and to the best of my knowledge , there 's no Tutsi blood in our family . But I know my father became rich thanks to a Tutsi , we lived a good life thanks to that Tutsi and for that reason , I can not harm a Tutsi . The Tutsi are not wicked , all this is only going to profit top leaders in the coutry . Do n't get discouraged to the point of asking God ... of saying that God ... @" Sometimes I 'd be so discouraged that I asked her what crime we committed , what sin the Tutsis committed to the point of becoming an outcast tribe . I felt I cursed .. I felt like we all were cursed . I did n't understand how God created us and could allow us to die like animals , even animals do n't die that way . Sometimes I do n't even how to put it . I used to tell her that God did n't exist but later on I asked God to forgive me because I know He is there and He is n't the one who made them such things . <EOS>
What about the child called Mutoni you met at the orphanage , did you see her again ? <EOS>
Umutoni , I looked for ... After I got my own house , I was planning to ask for her and raise her up together with Shumbusho since my cousins had also died . I felt I could afford taking care fo the 2 of them . I had started all the paper works in order to ask for her and Shumbusho , even Shumbusho was n't immediately given to me . They gave him to me when they were assured that I had the means to take care of him . As far as Umutoni is concerned , they told me relatives of her from Burundi went to ask for her . She was taken to the orphanage by a 12 year old girl , she had picked her among dead bodies . She was older and she is the one who told the people of the orphanage the names of Umutoni 's parents . <EOS>
Have you been able to bury in respect some of your people ? <EOS>
Yes , I buried Ngirabakunzi my little sister , Alfred and Uwitonze and our uncle Mutabazi . Because they ... Mutabazi was killed together with Uwitonze my 8 year old brother . We found them together . Alfred was killed near our home . I found their corpses and buried them . Dad was also killed near home , he was at the stadium but he managed to escape and then went back in Ruvumbu , our home area and that 's where he was killed . But I found out about it when he had already been taken to Bisesero with other corpses . Some people exhumed his body from where he was buried after being killed and took him to Bisesero . <EOS>
How did you manage to face life after the war after all the difficulties you went through plus the fact that Shumbusho was seriously disturbed by everything he had gone through ? How did you manage to face such a life ? <EOS>
It made me feel mature because it was as though I became Shumbusho 's mother , I started a new life ; I felt very responsible for him and I knew I 'd have to do everything I could to be able to raise him up and pay for his education . Besides , when I finished organizing myself and putting everything together , I found Cynthia , my cousin , the daughter of mom 's younger sister alive ! So I was living with both of them . I t was n't easy as Cynthia used to spend the whole night screaming , she still does it at times today . Even today she wakes up in the middle of the night saying , "@ Let 's flee , the Interahamwes are coming to kill us ... let 's flee , the Interahamwes are coming to kill us . @" So they 'd make a lot of noise in the night , even Shumbusho would join her . It was as though in their mind , they were still living in the war . They did n't believe it was over . I put Shumbusho in school but it was n't going to be possible for Cynthia to be away as she was in a very bad state . She went back to school later on . Shumbusho on the other hand ... I was trying my best to make my children happy . I would use my salary to shop and pay the rent ... I suddenly had all these responsibilities ... My reaction was n't to ... The life I lived then did n't quite match with my age ... I turned 18 during the war . I did n't think like an 18 year old person . I felt I needed to do all I could so that Shumbusho and Cynthia could study . That 's all I was concentrating on . <EOS>
How do you relate to the people who were once your neighbours in Kibuye , the people who were there when your parents and siblings were being killed and who are still there today ? How do you feel towards them ? <EOS>
I do n't know ... I do n't know if ... I think I no longer trust them because my dad was killed by a Hutu man who was a very good friend to him , such a good friend ... We could not hide ... You know how things are in the countryside ... Whenever the local wine had ripen it , we would n't hide from that man and dad could n't drink it without sharing it with him . They were like brothers , dad once told me that Karonkano 's father ... The man was called Karonkano , he later on acknowledged that he killed dad and asked for fogiveness but I never got to see him , he was imprisoned and he got sick in jail and also passed away . Karonkano was like my dad 's brother , dad once told me that Karonkano 's father and my grandfather had made a pact of blood . I asked him to explain to me what that meant and he said they drunk each other 's blood . Therefore , he said they were brothers and they could never betray each other . It is surprising to know that Karonkano is the one who went ahead and killed dad ... He was among the people who killed dad . He killed Alfred my brother and he did n't at least kill him in good way ... not that there are good deaths , but he did n't kill him completely . He hacked him on the head and on the back and was left agonizing near some hotels that are near our home ; at Kuryanyirakabano . He killed him , he hacked him and left him agonizing ... I was told that Alfred would ask the passersby - most of them were our neighbours - for water ... I think he was very thirsty and he bleeded a lot ... He was still young , he was 15 . He probably thought that despite the fact that they were Hutus , they could be goodhearted Hutus ... Nobody gave him water ! The thing that hurt me the most is that some of our neighbours came back and buried him alive ... So living with them ... I have to live with them since that 's how it needs to be so we can build the country ... But I can never trust the neighbours the way I used to , considering them as other human beings ; the thought seems impossible . I go home at times but there is so much fear in me even then . I feel as though they 'd also kill me if they had the opportunity . It 's impossible , I can not say that I could trust them again . Because if they were human beings , they would n't have killed children such as Ngirabakuniz , she was so young ! I was told that Ngirabakunzi kept telling them ... they told me that those who took her ... I was hurt so much to hear that she was killed by other children ! The oldest in the group that took her must have been about 13 . She was saying , "@ Please forgive me ! I am sorry that dad committed the crime of being a Tutsi , but I promise I will n't be a Tutsi anymore ! @" So I do n't think I can trust our neighbours again ! I will live with them because there 's nothing else I can do about it but I will n't trust them . That 's not possible ! <EOS>
Among the neighbours who killed your family , are there some who participated openly and never went to jail ? <EOS>
Yes there are ... In our areas ... most of them still do n't believe what they did was wrong an dhaven't come out in the open to tell the truth . I went there after the war and they told mehow my family was killed and who killed them . But when people started being arrested and the lawsuits started , they refused to testify . And when we would ask them about the previous times they said it , they 'd say they never said it . Some got arrested but others were never arrested . For example , among the children who killed Ngirabakunzi - one was mature enough - do you believe a 12 or 15 year old person who kills is still a child ? They arrested him and released him later on saying he is mentally disturbed , but I also think they released him because he was a child . But even the rest of the people who killed my family or neighbours were never arrested and those who were have been released . If I had known that they were going to release them , I would n't have wasted my time pursuing them . I would just have let them go . I would have let them go because this should be the time when ... they should be shameful of their deeds ... but when I see them , I am the one who is ashamed because they killed my family and others as well . Today I see them and I remember how I pursued them , wanting them to be arrested and I feel ashamed . I see them and I am so dishonored I could hide myself or I wish I could move to a place where I would n't be seeing them anymore ! It 's so shocking to run after somebody who killed your people so they can be imprisoned and then see them released ! Had I known it was going to be that way , I would n't have gotten involved . <EOS>
The politic of the government consists in releasing the people who have acknowledged their crimes so they can live with the Rwandan nation again and be united with them all over again . What do you think of that ? And how do you think things should be ? <EOS>
Personally , I can not say that ... I have lost so much because of those people . They took away my family and everyone else who lost his or her people lost in the same way . If my opinion is that they should be imprisoned and remain there - I have asked some people - and I believe that would be the right thing to do ... And that 's why I am saying that if I had known it from before , I would n't have spent so much time running after them for them to be put in jail . In jail , it is the government that feeds them . Not only did they kill my people - I 'd expect that their meals are expensive , their lives , their health , all that is costly - so the country is losing and it 's already lost anyway . So in my opinion , releasing them so that they can be working for the country is n't bad . There 's no other solution anyway . Because if I take the case of my home area in Kibuye , almost everyone in Rubengera killed ; even the one who did n't take a machete pointed at the place where a Tutsi was hiding , showing his or her friend . It reached a point where even children killed in Kibuye , a ten year old child or a seven year old one were busy looking for people in the bush . Meaning that all those people should be taken to jail which is impossible . How would the country develop if everyone is in jail ? That 's not possible . So we just have to accept , there 's no other solution . But it would be so much better if all of them would accept their crime and apologize . Not so much because they know acknowledging it and apologizing is a means of being in jail for a shorter time . I have a problem with it ! They teach them that if they accept their crimes , their punishment shall be reduced . One should first of all apologize from the heart , it should n't be because someone else has instilled it in one 's mind . They keep telling them how when they apologize even after killing many people , they 'll be in jail for a short time . It 's useless . <EOS>
The fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again . Are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ? It was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 . Meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong . So , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again . <EOS>
You said that imprisoning them is a waste for the country . Do you believe the country will gain when they are free ? Do you think it will be of any use for the country ? <EOS>
Putting them in jail in my opinion is ... a killer ... someone who killed infants , who got an infant , hit it on a wall and killed it ; who killed a mother with a shaped stick of wood ! Actually ... you 'd ... I do n't think they should even be imprisoned . I think they should die ... they should just die , they should be sentenced to death . But if almost all of them did that , what 's the point of imprisoning ? They should let them free so they can be seeing us on the streets ; they thought we would be wiped out ! They thought their children would be asking what a Tutsi was looking like . Let them see us ! One thing that hurts me is seeing a survivor becoming an alcoholic . We should n't turn into alcoholics or get discouraged . On the contrary , what happened should be a reason for us to stand up and develop ourselves as much as possible for those who have the means to attain that development and those who do not have comfortable life , they could approach their friends ... that 's all I can think of . <EOS>
What do you think of the lives of the survivors in this country ? <EOS>
About the survivors , let me start by talking about my personal experience . I am lucky to have a husband who gives me anything I want but there 's still nothing that gives me satisfaction here on earth . Nothing ! Be it the car I drive , the house in which I live ... at some point , my husband took me abroad in all the beautiful countries I had dreamt of visiting one day as a child . But it all turned out to be meaningless . I felt like I could have remained the way I had always been , I could have remained poor but with my siblings being with me . Have you ever had things and you have no one to share them with ? I am sharing my own experience . On the other hand , there are some who do not have a comfortable life , there are even others who are suffering from AIDS and who do not have any source of revenue . So I really wonder in what state the person who sleeps hungry is . I have a comfortable life , I never sleep hungry , I can eat anything I want and go anywhere I want whenever I want but I am never happy . I never go for more than a week without locking myself into the room to cry , asking God why my people died , why He allowed my dad to die without seeing my children ... And in my case , I am at ease , so I wonder how things are for those who do not have anything to eat at times . They are rotten , I do n't event think that they truly survived , they are still going through the sufferings , the pain . It 's all still present in their lives . Would say you survived if you were a parent without any child to keep you company ? When you get sick and there 's no one to take care of you , no one to bring for you food and yet you had children ? And the other thing that hurts me so much is that there are some people who believe that one only survived because they killed . But less people think that way today . Others say that if they did n't kill , they would n't have survived . They are killing us again and again whenever they say so ... it 's like driving the knife in the wound all over again ... Because when people ask you how you survived , saying that the fact that you survived shows that you ... that you also killed . They do not know God . You can not kill a people God created and wipe it out . So I am constantly sad , I am a very sorrowful person . Sometimes I am driving and ... there 's a time it happened to me but thanks God I was n't the one driving . I was in a cab and I remembered my people , I remember home , I remembered the way we were living despite the fact that we were poor , I felt like ... it was as though I lost conscience , I was lost ... When we reached the round about , I asked the taxi driver where he was taking me , I asked him where he was taking me since I had told him I was going to the gare ... Everyone was looking at me as if I was a mad woman , then I came back to my senses and realized we were at the round about . I believe I could have done something really bad if I was the one driving and maybe gotten myself into a terrible accident ! I always thank God that it did n't happen while I was driving . <EOS>
What I mean is that even though we survived , we all have something that was destroyed in our mind . There 's also ... it goes on . They should encourage us because when someone comes and asks you if you also killed , it is as though they were killing you once again . That 's all I can say . <EOS>
How do you feel about Gacaca , unity and reconciliation ? <EOS>
[ She laughs ... ] Unity and reconciliation ! Of course you can not tell people not to be united , because if you say so , you 'd be like the people who killed the Tutsis . You would n't be any different from them . On the other hand , would you dare tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed Alfred ? Would you tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed my father ? Yes , we have to live together in order to build the country but you can not tell me to reconcile with them . You would be asking for the impossible ! That 's just impossible ! <EOS>
