My name is Ruhurambuga Marcel . I was born in a place formerly called Mukingi commune , but now known as Ntenyo district in Gitarama district . We were eight brothers and sisters in my family . <EOS>
During the genocide four died , which means four others remained ; two sisters and two brothers died . And there are two two sisters and two brothers who survived in the whole family . The first born was a girl ; she was then married . Then the second and the third born were boys , I was the fifth born . Our first born was called Mukayiranga Rose and the second born was called Burabyo Gabriel ; he died in the genocide . The third born was called Rudahunga Michael ; he also died , then Mukakimenyi Marceline who died also . My father 's names were Hategekimana Gakuba . In brief , the genocide in the Gitarama area did not start in the last days . Because I remember how Habyarimana 's plane was crashed on the sixth at night , and we got the news in the morning of 7th . <EOS>
Our district was neighbouring that of Kabagali , previousily known as Masango . Many people used to pass by coming from Kibuye heading to Kabgayi . Sometimes they would pass by home and we would give them food . The massive killings in our region started on 21st of April . That was when the killings started and many people were fleeing from Kibuye . I remember some people used to go for patrols and some of them used to ask my elder bothers to join them in the tour of duty . Therefore , they would join them and make rounds . Later on , the people who used to call my brothers for patrols were mislead by the counsellors and the bergomaster who was called Nsabimana Basile and they stopped making patrols and started burning people 's homes instead . <EOS>
About my family , we lived in Rutagara sector in Bamagayo cell . We were the only Tutsis who lived in that cell ... my father was the only Tutsi who lived there . He was the only one who remained there in 1959 ; all his brothers fled but he remained there because he was studying . And then when he completed his studies he married and ended up the only Tutsi living in the area [ where we were born ] . The genocide started but our neighbours confused us ; during the 1959 war , when my dad came from school , he found when all his brothers had fled . Grandpapa was already dead ; that is what we have been told as their story . It was their Hutu neighbours who came and took him up ; they looked after him , built him a house , gave him back their cows and and when he reached time to marry , they got him a wife . In other words , they were like his parents or his only relatives . They were the closest people he had . He always used to invite them on all special occasions . After they married , they had eight children , still in the same cell . We neither had an uncle nor an aunt in that area . The closest relatives we had were in Gitarama towards the town called Karama in Shyogwe . Others lived in Kibungo where they resided after surviving the 1959 war . <EOS>
Therefore , when genocide started in 1994 , thing happened the usual way . Be it the hens we owned , be it the cattle , be it the rabbits , all our livestocks were taken by the neighburs as they normally did whenever there was a war . They gathered everything and said to us , "@ Do n't worry , nothing will happen to you . @" They divided our livestock between themselves ; some took two cows , others took three , others took goats and we saw them take everything with our own eyes . Some took hens ... they just took anything they came across . <EOS>
They moved us with the intention of hidding us but they were n't sincere . Tutsis would come from Kibuye fleeing towards Kabgayi and we would see them living but we stayed in our neighbours ' homes . Things continued like that until around the first dates of May . I remember a certain boy who was our neighbour but who had joined Habyarimana 's army , he had been shot on the elbow . His name was Shyaka the son of Nsengiyumva Innocent . And then he came and said , "@ You have n't yet killed Nicolas ? @" [ Nicolas was my father 's name ] they all went crazy , I think they killed him in the beginning of May . I do n't remember the day neither the date but he was the first to be killed . They got him but they first took all of us . By the way , I think I am mistaken ; that boy Shyaka found when my father had already been killed . Then he said , "@ How could you kill Nicolas and live his children ? @" <EOS>
He went on to say , "@ It 's impossible . @" In the beginning of May , they took all of us with dad , saying that they were taking us to the district , at Mukingi commune . At the commune they would put people in the buses and take them to Kabgayi , I do n't know what used to take place there at Kabgayi because I never went there . They took my dad and mum and my young brother who was called Serubibi Guido and my sister Mukakimenyi Marcelline . They took them saying that they were taking them to the District 's offices . Somewhere on the way , they put my mum aside . One of the militias made my young brother escape through the millet plantation that was around because he was aware of what was going to be done to those people . Later his companions looked for my brother , a certain man who was nicknamed Nangwahafi Samuel , his real name was Ntezimana Samuel , looked for my brother asking , "@ Where did Guido go ? Where is he ? @" But they never found him . <EOS>
They proceeded only with my father . My mother was left behind to die of sorrow . Then my father was handed to another gang of killers on Mwendo hill . And when he saw the perpetrators with machetes and clubs , he decided to run away . As he ran , the group that took him there acted as though they did not want to kill him . The other group ran after him and grabbed him . He could n't run very fast as he was tired and chased by many people at the same time . They lead him towards Kiryango River and when they reached there , his whole body was tied ; arms and legs were tightly tied and then they drowned him alive . It was the rainy season . It was raining heavily and water carried him as it flowed . His executioners cast stones on him , aiming his head and saying , "@ He knows how to swim , he may get out of the water . @" They did so until he died . <EOS>
About a week after my father 's death , that was when Shyaka , the soldier I was talking about came . He was the son of Nsengiyumva Innocent . He asked , "@ How could you kill Nicolas and leave his children ? Why did n't you eliminate them all ? @" By then I was in secondary [ form one ] . Then the killers added , "@ Especially his son who goes to school . He knows all the secrets of Inkotanyi . He is part of them . Therefore , he must be killed ! @" My older brother Burabyo Gabriel was hiding at Rusizana 's house . One night Rusizana bought my brother beer while he was supposedly hiding him . Gabriel took the beer and got drunk . Then Rusizana made him talk loudly . The gang of perpetrators , which worked with Shyaka climbed the fence and got inside . They go him and the last word I heard him saying was , "@ Rusizana , why did you betray me ? We fed on the same breast , how could do this to me ? @" From what I heard ; when my mum was breastfeeding Gabriel , Rusizana 's mother stopped breastfeeding him . Therefore , my mother would breastfeed both Rusizana and Gabriel at the same time . They shared the same breast , the way twins do . My brother was about 27 years . He first fought the killers but they stabbed him ; I heard him screaming . There was moonlight , so I quietly followed them , shifting from place to place to see how they would kill him . They killed him at a certain bush but I never went closer to the bush and I could n't see clearly although it was on moonlight . They killed him ; they finished him up . <EOS>
When we were exhuming and re @-@ burying his remains from that bush , I realized that they stoned him to death , because we found stones on top of his head and his skeleton was tied up with ropes . The following day at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon , I was attacked in my hide out at Munyawera 's home . There lived a man called Katabandama Eugene in the neighborhood but he did not know I was hiding around there . It was very cold ; I went and climbed their fence very slowly before they woke up . I went into an ‘ umuvure ’ [ a traditional thing used for making banana wine with the shape of a boat ] and entered in the cow 's manger in which I found kept manure and used it to cover myself . Maybe someone saw me . I do n't know what happened ; I just saw people searching in that house and later came to find me . I remember I was wearing a yellow dress ; so they took me out of the manger . It was Shyaka and a female Interahamwe called Mukakare , Shyaka 's brother called Aphrodis Munyanziza plus many others whose names I did n't know . <EOS>
They made me stand out of the manger and took my clothes off . However , they left me with my trousers and a shirt . My mother was also around but like in the previous instances , she was not harmed . She was just left to live in misery and trauma for loosing all her family . They took me ; whipping my legs all the way and took me to a place called Kabuga where I was subjected to the worst torture you can ever imagine . They beat me up , spat in my face , and forced me to move on my knees and elbows . In brief , they did everything they wished with me . Shyaka asked me where my brother Gabriel was and in response , I asked him if he did n't know where he had put him the previous night . "@ Listen to the way Tutsi are arrogant . @" He said then he kicked me on the chest . He laid me on the ground and hit me hard on the back . He grabbed me and hit every part of my body . <EOS>
I sat there and after a short while , a boy called Joseph the son of Murengerantwari came . It was his father Murengerantwari , who was hiding my cousin 's wife . My cousin was called Bihezande he was also killed . Then those perpetrators ordered Joseph to go and pick up the sorcerer that was hiding in their home . He went there and brought a lady with him . We were made to sit there and they hit us ... and around 7:00 p.m. They tied our arms on our backs . They used a piece of cloth that she would wrap on her head to tie her . As for me , they used the T @-@ shirt I was wearing and passed it on the chest and tied my arms behind . They took us to Mr. Silas ' ruined home and made us sit there near the septic tank , where people fleeing from Kibuye were thrown after being hacked . [ The same people I mentioned before . ] <EOS>
Those that they would ambush were taken there . I was the first one to be caught . I thought they were going to kill me . I was made to sit on top of the pit with my legs hanging over it ; I was tied up . However no one wanted to kill me , I had been in the same school with most of the perpetrators . Therefore , whoever they would tell to kill me would go back because I would look straight in his eyes . Then another group of Interahamwe came , Shyaka and Alex [ I do n't know his other name ] were among them . All I know about Alex is that he was a son to Muneza Yohana [ John ] . Then Alex asked , "@ Look at that cretin as tall as Rwigemera ! I will show you what I will do with him . @" It was late in the evening and it was dark ; one could n't see clearly . Then he got a hammer wanting to hit me on the head , somehow I moved the head and he hit on the neck . He hit me three times and I do n't know how I got into the pit . I do n't know if it is someone who pushed me there , or if I went in by myself . I only remember the moment when I gained conscious and found myself lying on my stomach in faeces @/ excrements . It was a latrine that had already been used . But the piece of cloth , which they had used to tie me , had loosened and my arms were like this ... I noticed that they had thrown bricks on me . Fortunately , the bricks fell on the side ; they did not hit me . I do n't know what they did to my sister @-@ in @-@ law , whom we were together , up there . But I guess they raped her and then she was dumped into the pit upside down while she was still tied up . All her bones at this level [ he shows ] were broken ; her pelvic bones were crashed . She was agonizing intensly in excrements . <EOS>
I tried to come out of the latrine by stepping on the bricks . I tried to take her out of it too and removed the piece of cloth that was tied on her . I tried to make her stand but she could n't because these bones [ he shows ] were crashed . She was screaming a lot ! I imagined ; "@ Someone screaming like this yet naked , no joints , the knee bones are crashed , nothing ... @" All her bones were crashed . I left her because I could see she had no life yet I was also dying myself . Then I started fighting to get out of the pit . It was a circular shaped pit and when I was almost reaching the top I slipped and fell back into the pit . I again tried to come out ; I stepped on the bricks that they had thrown in the pit and in the bricks , there was a stick pointing up . Therefore , I got support from that stick and came out . There was another stick that was hanging across the pit , I held it and finally got a way out of the pit . But when I fell back in the latrine for the second time , it was because all my clothes were wet . Therefore , I removed everything and remained only in my underwear . <EOS>
Did you fall back into it twice ? <EOS>
Yes , I feel into it twice . When I got on top , I was in dilemma , wondering where I should go . I started thinking about the way I could go back and save the woman that I had left inside the latrine . I thought of whom I could ask for help to save the lady . However , I could n't think of anybody who could respond positively to my request for help . While still thinking , I heard the same group of people who had dumped us in the latrine coming back . They were coming from a center called Kabuga , in Kanjevuba area area . They came up the hill and all of them were drunk . They were saying , "@ The people we dumped in the latrine must have died . @" They proceeded . The lady was still agonizing . Then they said , "@ We should suppress that pit after throwing about twenty more Tutsis . @" The pit latrine was about eight meters deep . <EOS>
If I consider the height of the pit , I would fall back into it after climbing up approximately half of it . Looking at the way I 'd fall into it , I 'd say it was about 6 to 8 meters long . The same perpetrators approached the pit with torches and lamps . When I heard them , I hid myself in Silas ' abandoned home . They lit their torches into the pit and said , "@ They have surely died . @" And then they went back to their homes . I watched them going to their homes but I can n't tell what time it was by then . However , it was around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m , about the time you hear small creatures murmuring . The time when everything is asleep , the time when even frogs can not croak . <EOS>
They went to their homes . Then I stood and asked myself if I knew where I was going . "@ What kind of a life is this ? Oh God , I wish I had died ! If they see me , will they kill me ? @" I asked myself . But I was freezing and the more the wind blew on my neck , the more the injury caused by the hammer would swell . My neck was swollen , almost to the size of my head . Then I started walking like this ... I wondered where to go ... I remembered a village called Buha where my friends whom we went to school together and with whom we used to play drum together during the holidays lived . They were called Karangwa and Rurangwa their father 's name was Ndongozi . But those boys had become terrible Interahamwes . But I still decided to go there because I thought that even if they went ahead and killed me , they would n't subject me to grave tortures before killing me . But in order to go to their home , I had to cross a river called Ruhondo . And when I reached the water , I first rolled into it so as to get rid of all the excrements and maggots . After a while I said to myself ... around that place there was a camp of Habyarinama 's soldiers in a place called Gafunzo . As I approached that area , I heard people shouting and smoking drugs . "@ These must be soldiers and they are going to kill me @"@ , I thought . Then I went back to our abandoned home where I found our dogs . When the dogs saw me , they tried to follow me but I chased them away and I passed though a nearby bush . Around there , lived a man called Pascal Kamonyo , whose wife was my godmother . And my sister called Mukaburabyo Pélagie had hid in their home . <EOS>
Therefore , I decided to go to them doubting if they would accept me in their home . As I was still knocking on the door ... My elder brother and my younger brother Serubibi Guido used to come to eat in the same home and after they would go back to their hidouts . But they had a special way of knocking in that home . Therefore , when I reached there , I knocked on the door but no one responded . I knocked and knocked but there was no response . It was becoming bright and morning was coming then my brother Rudahunga Michael saw me and he came towards me . He asked me , "@ How are you ! I thought they killed you , how did you escape them ? @" I started telling him what had happened but he stopped me because it was a long story . He took me to a man called Nzaramba whose wife was called Mujawimana Françoise , she worked at a certain hospital ; she was an assistant nurse . I spent there about three nights and she warmed water and washed me . She treated the injury that I had . I spent about three days there . <EOS>
That lady took me to her father 's place but I spent there a few days and then I thought of joining Ndongozi 's family ; the other friends of mine whom we went to the same school . By then my injury was getting better and the swelling was reducing . Therefore I crossed the river and went there . But instead of going to Mr. Ndongozi 's home , I went to his young brother 's home . He was called Ndanga Aloys and he was my dad 's friend ; him and my father had given each other cows . [ In the Rwandan culture , giving a cow to a person is a symbol of friendship and solidarity ] . However , I doubted if they would accept to hide me or if they would kill me . Fortunately they welcomed me in their home and I stayed there until ... it was towards the end of May . I stayed there and left the place when the whole family was preparing to flee . When the Inkotanyi captured Kabgayi ; that was on the 2nd of June in 1994 . They all fled . Then they asked me , "@ We are preparing to flee , should we live you in the house ? @" <EOS>
I told them it was okay . "@ Since you are living I will wait for darkness to fall then I will also go . @" That is what I told them . In the evening , on that particular day I left that house for Kamonyo Pascal 's home . My sister was hiding at his place and I was sure that my brothers Guido and Michael were still alive . Before they left , the people who had given me shelter told me , "@ Your fellows Inkotanyi captured Kabgayi and Ruhango . They advised me to go towards the areas the Inkotanyi had already captured . They warned me of all the places where I may find the Interahamwe and told me not to reach those places . After getting those important information , I decided to pass by and see my sister and brothers so that we should go all together . I found her and we spent the whole day together . Then around midday , Habyarimana 's soldiers came from Gafunzo to that home where we were and asked the old man , " We have heard that you keep cockroaches in your house . @" "@ How can I keep those cockroaches yet I 've heard that they slaughter people ? @" he replied them . We were terrified . <EOS>
I thought this time my end had come ! The old man was talking through the window as we were just behind the door . If they had tried to open the door or break it , they would have seen us . "@ We shall come back to verify . @" They said while living . When they left we got out and hid in a nearby plantation . I was waiting for the nightfall to tell my sister the information I got from the family where I was hiding concerning areas occupied by the Inkotanyi . Then in the evening we went back to Mr. Pascal to get some food . We ate and after eating , we started looking for my brother but he was nowhere to be found . We asked the old man to help us and get him for us but still he could n't see him . I told my sister , "@ You saw what took place during the day , we have to leave with our younger sister . @" She was about five years old then . She was also living in the same home . But the old man refused to let us take her . He said , "@ This is a very young girl , you can not handle her . I will stay with her and I will tell everyone that she is my granddaughter . No one will disturb her . @" Then I told my sister that we should go and if Michael was still alive , we would somehow meet . My sister and I left . But the young sister who was about 5 years old remained at Pascal 's place . She had been inside the house throughout , she never used to go out ; when we reached a certain place called Kigarama , she got very sick . I took her to a nearby home whose owner was called Ntakiyimana . <EOS>
What was she suffering from ? <EOS>
She suddenely shivered . I do n't know if it was malaria or something else . We spent two nights in that home . He was a good man and he even brought malaria tablets and some painkillers and gave them to my sister . After that , he directed us where to find the RPF members . Then we asked him if he knew where our brother could be hiding ; I thought he was hiding around that area since we could n't find him on the other side . Then he told us that , the boy we were talking about had been killed . I tried to argue that he could n't be dead because I had seen him the previous day . But the man described him for us and assured us that they killed him the day before and his body was thrown in the same latrine where I was once thrown . We were very sad . Then we left but that man also helped us by giving us proper directions to where the Inkotanyi were . My brother was also dumped in the pit upside down . We noticed it later after the Genocide , when we were exhuming his remains ; I identified his bones from the pair of trousers he was wearing during the genocide , and his legs were facing up . We spent two days in Ntakiyimana 's house then we left . <EOS>
We met the Inkotanyi at Kazinganyoni near Byimana . When we reached their roadblock , my sister got so scared , she thought the roadblock belonged to Habyarimana 's soldiers . But I convinced her that according to the directions we had been given , Habyarimana 's soldiers were not here . Then we proceeded and reached the roadblock . I can not tell where soldiers came from , they suddenly appeared and surrounded us . <EOS>
They asked us , "@ Who are you and where are you going ? @" We introduced ourselves and they started conversing with us . We told them all our experience and they really felt pity for us . Since then we lived with them and they took us to Byimana where we joined other people . Frankly speaking , I never expected to find any other family member alive apart from my sister and I. Even my mother ; though the killers used to live her to suffer the misery of loosing all her family members , I still thought they would kill her one day . After sometime our mother joined us at Byimana , our other sisters had been killed . One of my sisters was hiding at Mr. Rutwaza whose son Rusizana betrayed my brother Michel . The same Rusizana is the one who asked his father to send him a girl he was hiding in his house . Our last born remained at Pascal 's house and Pascal had promised never to leave the girl , "@ I will always flee with her . @" Later he was attacked but we had already left for Byimana . We had joined the Inkotanyi way before . <EOS>
When we reached Byimana [ my sister and I ] with the Inkotanyi , mum went to get the rest of the kids [ Mukakimenyi Marcelline and Ingabire Clemence . ] But they refused to give them to her ... And the Interahamwe attacked Pascal Kamonyo who had stayed with our young sister . They beat Pascal very badly . And when my sister realized the way they were beating the man , she ran away . She went to hide in the home where my elder sister was also hiding . It became very easy for the killers ; they found them and killed both of them at the same time . My mother continued to ask the killers for her children but all they did was laugh at her . None of us know how they died but what we learnt later is that they took them to Karambo towards Mutara and this is where all the children were killed , after killing them , they threw them in river Kiryango . The same river where my father was drowned . That is how they died . Now my other young brother is still alive and he is a student in the 5th year of secondary school . He is called Serubibi Guido . <EOS>
During the war , Serubibi hid at Mr. Gwiza Dionizi 's where he met many other boys [ tutsis ] who were planning to join the RPF troops . He insisted that he wanted to go with them but he was too young to join the army . They just went with him . We were living in Byimana and he was across in Gahengeri . Some day , those boys were walking around in Byimana and saw me by chance . They met my mum and sister and after confirming that we survived , they went and brought him to us . Since then we have been living together . I guess you can now tell how many we are now ; two of us had survived , [ my sister and I ] then we got our young brother , plus our mum . Therefore , we are four . Later we heard that our first @-@ born sister who was married survived . We met her in Kinazi when we were going to a place called Rwabusoro towards Bugesera . That 's how we survived . <EOS>
Q ... [ bad sound ] <EOS>
After they had invaded Mr Kamonyo 's home , our young sister ran away and went to the home where my older sister was hiding . But remember I told you that my sister was hiding in Rutwaza 's home yet his sons are the ones who killed my brother . They took him from his hide out in their home and hacked him to death . My mother pleaded with them to give back her our sisters but they refused and fled with them as they retreated from RPF soldiers . When they came back we were told that our two sisters had been killed but we do n't know how they were killed . <EOS>
What happened for your neighbours to betray you ? Because according to what you told us , they seemed to be like relatives . How did they change ? <EOS>
You see ... even though we had lived together like relatives , it happened that way because we had no alternative . There were no other people to live with . Otherwise we had somehow noticed that they [ Hutus ] were malicious earlier . There is a saying in Kinyarwanda , which says "@ You can never treat a leopard that has frightened you once before as a wild cat @" meaning that , once you are born with a weakness , you can never change . We lived with them because we had no other choice . But one could tell that they [ Hutus ] are bad . When the time for fleeing came ; it was too late to find somewhere to hide . But they assured us how they would hide us and our properties ... they later said , "@ We must kill you ! @" But even before , one could tell from the look on their faces that they were capable of killing us but we had no alternative and nowhere to flee to . However , they had n't been able to kill us because of the custom I told you . [ My father exchanging cows with them . ] Their sons who were young and strong supported and encouraged them to kill us . Most of their sons had tasted fresh blood ; they lived in Kigali and some of them were soldiers . Therefore , they went ahead and killed us also . <EOS>
Does it mean that you had already understood that they would kill you ? <EOS>
Yes , they had the desire to kill us before . They used to have some skirmishes with my father in the past ; it was clear that they envied my father for having a big land . But they were forgetting that my dad was n't born alone ; though he then lived there on his own , he had brothers who had fled . They would come and take part of our land without permission ; like the family I told you who were almost like our relatives , they had taken a portion of our land ! Several others had built on our land ; behind our home there was a family on our land , on both sides of our home there was another family , still on our land . Someone would just come and build on our land but there was nothing we could do because the government was not fair to the Tutsis . Therefore , we would just live together but it did n't mean that we were happy with each other . <EOS>
In 1994 in Gitarama there was a political party called MDR , how was your life then ? <EOS>
Well during the time of multi @-@ partyism in Gitarama , MDR was the mother party to all the others . It was the youth that got very involved . For us , I can say we were neutral because you could n't join MDR and you could n't also show , which political party you supported . We would just keep silent but the rest were so involved . People would rise flags for their parties ; like MDR , PSD but especially MDR would be present . We would just pretend to be absent ; that is what I would call it . <EOS>
Would n't they force you to join those parties ? <EOS>
No , they would just come to teach us and ask us , "@ Why are you not in any party ? @" but we would just tell them that we did n't belong to any party . They would come to us ... hope you know how people from Gitarama are hypocrits . They used to come to us and say things but they would n't force us . Force rose when they started hunting for Inkotanyi . They would go to a certain home and search everywhere looking for the Inkotayi . I remember in 1992 that 's when they came to search at home . There was a cousin who had come to visit us from Nyanza . So they came claiming that we were sheltering an Inkotanyi soldier but instead of searching they looked for our local brew and started drinking . And finally they left . <EOS>
Does that mean that between 1990 and 1994 they never tortured you , did they do anything bad to you ? <EOS>
Such things happened but we would take it lightly ; for example , stealing or cutting people 's banana plantations . But serious torture like beating a person and others ... well there used to be some moral torture like scaring people , nocking on the doors at night . Those are the things that they would do . But to us , it meant nothing . <EOS>
Is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ Tutsi ] ? <EOS>
No , there was n't any other problem . However , even what was done to us was due to out ethnic belonging [ Tutsi ] it was the Hutus who were doing that and we were the only Tutsis who lived there . All our neighbours were Hutus . Definitely one could tell they were the ones to do all those acts ! <EOS>
You told me that you come from Gitarama . Were you born there ? <EOS>
Yes , but while we lived in Mwendo , our home origin was in Karama . Our grandfather had shifted to Mwendo and we lived on his land . He had a very large land . The reason I am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone . He had few relatives and therefore seemed to own a big land . He was living there with a few of his relatives . <EOS>
You earlier talked about people who were fleeing from Kibuye towards Kabgayi . Would you please elaborate more about that ? <EOS>
The population fled Kibuye because their houses had earlier been burnt . They were chased from Kibuye . They used to pass through our home area while fleeing . We used to help them , as we knew we were related to some extent . We would give them food and all we could to help them . Then they would proceed to Kabgayi . Most of them would n't reach their destination because our neighbours had set roadblocks . They would kill them ; ladies would be raped and sometimes made sex slaves . In fact the killings had started and most people would not go beyond that roadblock ; they would be murdered and dumped into a deep pit that was in this area . Very few would reach Kabgayi . For example , there were many corpses in the pit where I had been dumped by the time we exhumed them . All the corpses were reburied together because we could n't tell their places of origin . Perhaps they were from Kibuye or areas around Kabagari . Most people were killed on the way , our neighbours killed them . And we know them [ the killers ] . <EOS>
Q ... <EOS>
I was very lucky to recognize my older brother thanks to his trousers . I reburied his remains at our home . I even saw my sister in law 's body , the one who had been thrown in the pit the time I was also dumped there . I recognized her thanks to her clothes too [ she was in her underwear ] we reburied her too . Others were buried together with the help of the local authorities . No one was left in the pit . <EOS>
How many corpses were exhumed from that pit ? <EOS>
In that pit ... while they were throwing us in the pit , the perpetrators would say they would cover it after adding more 20 people . Well I do n't know the exact number but I would think they were over thirty . <EOS>
How many people were in pit the time you exhumed them ? <EOS>
While exhuming ... We first found my older brother on top , then we found our sister in law . We found them before digging deep into it . So , we went to rebury them . I think they were about eighteen . There were more people in the next pit but I do n't know the exact number of people who were there . There was a certain man who was dumped into that second pit , he was called Sematetu and his wife cemented the pit . We just left it that way as we did n't wanted to break the cement . <EOS>
How many pits were there ? <EOS>
Two pits . <EOS>
What was the distance between the two pits ? <EOS>
About 300 meters . <EOS>
People in your area would kill some people and leave others . What was determing their choice ? <EOS>
They did not kill us because of the relationship between us ; they respected us . Even though we were the only [ Tutsi ] family in the area , they did n't take advantage of that . Fathers would warn their sons not to kill us because of a ritual pact of blood never to betray each other they had signed with our parents . So they would n't kill us although they had the intention to do so . Some of their sons became Interahamwe ; they even went for training and when they came back , they just wanted to finish us . Leaving us alive was partly due to the cowardice of Rwandans , the fear to be the one to start off the fire . They would say , "@ I can not be the one to kill them first @" due to historical reasons . But later , they were the ones to commit the terrible murders . <EOS>
But did you think their zeal to kill was normal ? <EOS>
Actually those who killed us were our neighbours and we knew them . Not only the killers , but also those who looted our properties . For example , I know who killed my elder brother . <EOS>
Where does your mother reside now ? <EOS>
Now she is living in ... at first we lived in Byimana centre . We no longer live there ; we shifted to a place called Imbare next to Shyogwe opposite to Kabgayi in AVEGA estate . She lives with my sister who lost her husband during the genocide . <EOS>
What does she do ? <EOS>
Nothing , she is illiterate . Before she was working in an orphanage looking after orphans but the orphanage closed and now she is just at home helping mum in the farm . <EOS>
How old were your parents then ? <EOS>
My father was born in 1935 that means that by then he was about 59 years old . While mum was born in 1944 . <EOS>
In which year were you born ? <EOS>
I was born in 1977 . Therefore , during the genocide I was about 16 years old . <EOS>
There 's this man , the soldier you told us about , did you know him ? How old was he ? <EOS>
He was about 21 years old . I guess he was born in 1974 . Maybe he was 20 years during the genocide since he was born in 1974 . <EOS>
Q ... <EOS>
We were neighbours . The distance between our homes was about 500 meters . Presently his father is under custody because he was involved in my older brother 's murder . He was participated in the murder of my brother , Shyaka , his older brother called Aphrodis Munyanziza , their younger brother called Mukaka Damascène and several others . All that man 's family and the soldier were there while my brother was being killed ; they all participated in his death . <EOS>
The time you were led to the pit , what was on your mind ? Tell us a bit of your experience . <EOS>
When they took me to the latrine hole , I thought my life was over . I had just seen and heard what they had done to my brother . When I was on top of the hole , I was curious about what heaven looked like , that 's all I could think of . I was wondering what took them so long to kill me . When he snatched a hammer , I thought he was going to smash my head and finish with me . Fortunately , I guess it was by Gods will ; he hit my neck instead of my head and that is how I survived . <EOS>
When you gained conscious did you manage to ... <EOS>
When I gained conscious and moved from the hole , I started thinking of where to go . I looked in the north and in the south and found no direction . I wished I had died ! I thought in case they came across me , they would do worse things than what they had done to me . I thought they would first amputate me or cut my ears or fingers off . Fortunately , they never caught me again . Otherwise , it would have been like dying twice . That is waht I can call it . <EOS>
You were so afraid that they would get you for the second time but you still followed them . Why were you following them ? <EOS>
I followed them because I wanted to see where they were going , in order to know where to pass . It was at night and they were drunk . After I verified that they had entered their homes , I found my way . In fact , I did n't have anywhere to go , I was just wandering around . That is why I followed them . <EOS>
Some people hid you , the home where you knocked and your brother was hiding ... Why were they different from others ? Why did they stand by you ? <EOS>
I can not tell . Maybe it was by God 's mercy . They really helped us yet we were n't friends . For example , that man I was talking about , Pascal ... he was my sister 's godfather . However , we were not so close to his family . We never expected him to help us the way he did . Surprisingly those who were supposed to help us , I mean our neighbours , those who seemed to be our relatives . They surely changed ! I would say they had always had a cruel nature , they were killers at heart and they had been pretending throughout . Maybe they had been sensitized to kill for ages but they had n't got courage to put it into practice . Once such a person gets someone to motivate him to killing , he hurries up into the action . The strangest thing is that the people we never expected to help us are the ones who did and those we thought would be the first ones to kill us were the ones to save us . I think it just depends on someone 's nature or personality . If not so , then it is by God 's power . I can not tell why they behaved like that . <EOS>
Then after the genocide you were fatherless ... <EOS>
After the genocide , I was left with my older sister ; our first @-@ born . And then I found my younger sister and brother . Since I am currently the oldest son in the family , I took upon myself all the family responsibilities yet I can not even fulfill their needs . As a result , I ended up growing up prematurely . Now I am considered as an old man at home ; I am the one who makes the decisions in the family . At my early age , I feel denied my freedom . I do n't find time to enjoy life like I should have at my age ; things like playing around with fellow teenagers or do other fun things . Instead I spend my entire time worrying about things that actually seem impossible to me , problems of which solutions are not easy to find . <EOS>
So , to you fis that an advantange or it is a disadvantage of the genocide ? <EOS>
They are genocide disadvantages because whenever I think about it ... for example when I am in class ; sometimes I am absent @-@ minded , busy thinking about my problems while others are concentrating . But if my older brother had survived , I would have relaxed a bit because he would be busy with family issues , as I also get busy with my studies . Not to mention if it was my father who had survived or any other older person in the family . I know everything is as a result of the genocide . I would have been able to use my time in class effectively rather than thinking about family problems while others are studying . But now I am failing to concentrate in class and in the end I will fail in school . At the same time , I can not find a solution to my problems ; I can not meet my family 's needs . Eeh ! Those are the consequences of the genocide that are affecting me . <EOS>
Do n't you get desperate at times ? <EOS>
I feel desperate but only for the time when I am thinking about my problems . But when I meet friends I forget about it . And then the feeling comes back during the holidays when I am at home seeing the situation in which my family is living . I get so desperate because I see everything yet I can not improve anything . <EOS>
Does it disturb you to the extent of spending sleepless nights or getting headaches ? <EOS>
Marcel <EOS>
Do you ever miss your childhood ? <EOS>
Do you ever miss your childhood ? <EOS>
What would you want to be in the future or what is your goal or wish in life ? <EOS>
What I wish , I do n't if I should call it a wish . Let me say first what makes me happy . Mostly it is to know that I have done something to help a genocide survivor . It may be giving advice or helping with something . However simple it may be , I am happy when I am the one who thought of helping and I actually did it ... I think I wish that all genocide survivors especially the young ones should be given the advantage of a scholarship because the old women who survived do not have much hope to live . They are desperate and sometimes miserable but for us who are still young we can go to school , we can exchange ideas with different people . Also the government should continue financing FARG so that those who were still kids when the genocide took place can continue their studies up to higher levels like we did . Maybe it 's difficult for us to adapt to this new life as we have the responsibility to take care of our young brothers and sisters . That 's when we can come together as genocide survivors and help each other in an association such as AERG where one gets advice , which helps me to fulfill my responsibilities of taking good care of my brothers and sisters . That 's what I wish for . I wish survivors would get a good life after their studies . After achieving that unity , then we would organize ourselves and plan to do something together ; that is if we have the necessary material [ financial support ] . <EOS>
What do you wish to do for your family ? <EOS>
What I can do for my family ? I am not sure , with the life I am leading now I can n't promise anything . I hope to first finish school then look for a job and that 's when I will be able to help . Otherwise if I start promising now , it might stress me or depress me yet I will n't loose anything if I wait until I finish my studies , start working and then help my family . <EOS>
What would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? What would you want them to know ? <EOS>
What would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? What would you want them to know ? <EOS>
When comparing the past to the present , what changes have you experienced in your personal life ? <EOS>
From what I see , there is a change in the leadership in Rwanda . There is a distinct change in leadership . During the former Government , there were several barriers ; it was a problem to get a school if you were a Tutsi , it was hard to study . But today people have proper access to schools . However , in the aspect of ideology for example ; things never changed at all . It is just because Rwandans never say the truth ; people can appear as lambs yet inside they are beasts . We live together but we do n't trust each other . But as far as freedom studying is concerned much has improved . There is also freedom of speech in our country . Nowadays , one can express his ideas with no fear , which is a great change compared to the past . <EOS>
What do you think about reconciliation , do you think it is possible in Rwanda ? <EOS>
Maybe reconciliation will be possible among our descendants if we will tell them the truth and show them the right path . However , reconciliation is impossible amongst us in this generation . I can give an example ; someone can assure you that he pleaded guilty and accepted what he did . But when you follow up the way he pleads guilty , you can hear him say things like @: so and so was killed by some attackers on such and such date , but I never participated in his murder . They always plead guilty but never accept their personal role . When someone is like that , it shows that he or she is more concerned about politics but do not really want to show his or her role . Then if such a person came to me asking for forgiveness , it would be impossible for me to forgive him or her . They treat us like a...I think reconciliation in our generation is very difficult . <EOS>
What can you tell people who do n't agree that genocide happened in Rwanda ? <EOS>
People who do n't agree that there was genocide in Rwanda ? It depends on the context in which they deny it ; some people pretend not to know what happened , while others really do n't know what happened . But to those who intentionally deny the genocide , all I can do for them is to take him to places like Ntarama , Bisesero , Nyamata and other places such as Gikongoro , which have genocide memorial sites . And then after I would ask them only a single question @: "@ What do you think was the cause of their death ? Was it a thunder that killed these people and brought them here ? Were they strong winds ? Were they floods ? Or did they commit suicide ? @" Then I would wait to hear their answer . They would n't get any answer especially when they are Rwandans . But if it is a foreigner , I guess he would be surprised and just keep quiet . <EOS>
To someone who is still young , what do genocide memorial sites mean ? <EOS>
Memorial sites are very good . Because they are basics for our history . They will help us never forget what took place in Rwanda . You have just asked me the question " What can you tell a person who does n't agree that genocide happened in Rwanda ? @" I guess you heard that the answer was based on the memorial sites ; I told you that I would take such people to the memorial sites and ask them if those people committed suicide or if the bones are for decoration . These memorial sites will be there for years and years . Our children will see them ; Historians all over the world can come for their research and see what happened . Therefore , memorial sites to me as part of the young generation , especially as a genocide survivor , are there to remind us and make us never forget what happened . <EOS>
It seems like you are fighting against forgetting about the genocide . What would "@ forgetting @" mean to you ? Why are you really against forgetting ? <EOS>
Listen ... what it means to me , when you forget things especially bad things that happened to you , it means that what happened meant nothing to you . If you can forget your father 's death , your mother 's death , and your relative 's death , deaths that caused agony to the whole country [ Rwanda ] , and rub out all your beloved ones from your brain yet you were left alone in this world , without anyone to talk to or to run to , to me that would be an unforgivable sin . <EOS>
What can you tell those who do n't know Rwanda ? <EOS>
What can you tell those who do n't know Rwanda ? <EOS>
I would like to ask you something that I forgot to ask you before . How do you feel whenever you pass by the pit latrine you were dumped or how do you feel when you think about it ? <EOS>
Whenever I pass there , I change a bit and behave differently . I feel strange . It is as though I loose my humanity . However , I do n't have a cruel heart , the heart to kill . I do n't feel like talking to anyone . I just say a prayer , no matter how short it is , I just say one word of thanksgiving to the Lord . But in case I see someone related to the militias at that time , I become aggressive . Sometimes I think of doing something horrible but because it is n't my nature I just get over it . Whenever I reach there , I remember all the bad things that happened to me and then I feel like doing some horrible acts but I just ignore that feeling because I naturally do n't have that nature . I can never do that ... <EOS>
And what do you think about the other lady ; your cousin 's wife ? <EOS>
I normally do n't talk about that issue . In all the testimonies that I gave out , I never talked about her because I always get shocked when I remember her . I always believe that I could have done something for her but I failed to it . The way I left the pit is the way I would have got her out . Then maybe she would have been treated or something else would have been done ... but that is not what I did . There was n't anybody to help me ; maybe if I had got someone , I would have asked him to help me save the lady . Most of the time , I dream about her and my young sister ; I always see their images . Even my two young sisters whom we do n't know how they were killed . I always remember them . Last time when we were exhuming my brother 's remaining , we almost lost his bones among other bones [ mixed with my sister in law 's bones ] but I separated them immediately . Now we reburied them separately but next to one another . At least now when I plant flowers on their graves , I feel better . <EOS>
Is this your first time to give a testimony ? <EOS>
It is not my first time . Besides telling it to my friends , I have given a testimony twice before . The first time it was at Byimana where we were exhuming remainings of people . Many people were killed in that area and now we constructed a memorial site there on the behalf of the district . I gave out my testimony the day we reburied them . This is the second time . <EOS>
The first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ? <EOS>
The first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ? <EOS>
How do you feel now as you talk about it ? <EOS>
Whatever the case , when I tell my testimony ... especially when I know that I am telling to someone I trust , someone who is willing to listen to me , I feel like I have given out part of my burden to be carried by someone else . It is like someone who comes from doing sports sweating , and then he rests a bit and takes shower , then he is given something to eat . He will find it so sweet and tasty . In comparison to my story , when I give out my testimony instead of keeping everything to myself , I feel like I have shared it with someone . It is like some one has helped me to carry my burden and I feel it reducing inside my heart . At such times , I even sleep peacefully . <EOS>
Apart from here , do you normally have people you share this with ? <EOS>
Maybe a fellow survivor ; it is the only person we share the same problems but I can not tell it to any other person . And it can only happen when we talk and find ourselves with common challenges . For example the members of AERG ; we sit with them and talk like friends . Freddy can testify this . The first time we met ... we talked and we were free as though we were from the same family . But telling it to other people or to those who committed the genocide seems too hard for me . <EOS>
To you what does the term "@ survivor @" mean ? <EOS>
What message can you give to the foreigners or Rwandans of today or in the future ? <EOS>
The message I can give them ... I would like to give a message to especially Rwandans who do n't know Rwanda . Because telling a Rwandan about genocide is not very difficult . Although they ignore it [ genocide ] , they know about it . But foreigners especially white people take things lightly . They do n't consider this the way they are . But in actual sense , they shy away from the truth . Because they had cameras and some of them participated in the genocide . For example the Belgians and those UN soldiers of UNAMIR together with others , they had all the information . All I can tell them is ; when we say this , it is not a form of enjoying life . When we say this ... consider the time I have spent here ! I am a student , I am surposed to be in class now with other students . I had to spend my time here instead of learning extra chapters in class ! I know it is very important to give out my testimony so that the whole world especially the foreigners would see it . I think the genocide that took place in Rwanda should be given its value . Although there is nothing they can do to help us as Rwandans , they should just believe that there was genocide in Rwanda and give it its value . When we spend days talking about the genocide , we do n't say it for sale . President Paul Kagame once talked about it . He said ; " Those who say that we sell genocide , I wish they tell me how much is a kilogram or a litter of blood . @" <EOS>
The genocide we talk about is the genocide that hurt us . What I am saying today , if you asked me to repeat it in two years time , I would say the same story . Even in three years time , it will still remain the same story . This implies that it [ genocide ] affected me in some ways . Even at this moment as I am talking about it , there is something changing in my brain . In fact , it is like pausing the progress of my life to go though the past . Sometimes I think it affects the body system . I guess that is the testimony I would give to them . To give value to the genocide that took place in Rwanda ! To give value to the survivors and Rwandans in general ! <EOS>
To you , what 's the importance of remembering and giving value to genocide ? What would you wish to be remembered forever ? <EOS>
What I wish to be remembered is the massive innocent people that were killed . Now they would be helping the counntry and our country would develop like other countries . Therefore , forgeting the genocide is a big mistake . Once you forget the genocide it seems like you do n't value Human Rights . Because you can never obey Human Rights yet you do n't accept so and so as a human being . Therefore , considering genocide means considering people as human beings and not animals . And respecting people as human beings . That is all I can say . <EOS>
Do you want to add on anything ? We still have twenty @-@ six minutes extra . <EOS>
The additional information I have is for those who do n't know this country , a testimony to people who do n't acknowledge that there was genocide in Rwanda . What I can add on , I would first go back to the case of the survivors especially the youth because the old ones are too miserable to listen to this . But young people especially the survivors I would give them my testimony saying that , "@ They should never despair . @" We can not change the past . I am not saying that we forget and reconciliate . But we should not be taken up by out past . But it does n't mean that we should forget the genocide , instead we should always think about it because it makes us strong . Remembering gives us power to fight against any other thing that would ever cause another genocide in Rwanda . We are the ones to give genocide its value . If we do n't value it , no one else will . If we do n't give out these testimonies , no one else will give them out . If we do n't fight for the construction of memorial sites , no one will ever stand up for their constuction . It is our task to stand up for our rights . We should get our freedom of living . To live again . This is the testimony I can give to the youth survivors . Thanks . <EOS>
