Today is 23rd of March 2007 . We are at Kacyiru together with Father Muzungu Bernardini where we are going to have a conversation on history . Father Bernardini Muzungu can you start by introducing yourself . <EOS>
Like you already said , I am called Bernardin Muzungu and I am a Dominican father I live here in Kacyiru . I was born back home on a hill called Buhoro in Nyaruguru , I was born in 1932 . <EOS>
I got here amongst the Dominican fathers through the lengthy journey of schooling starting from Kibeho , in the elementary school in Kabgayi , being part of the Dominicans made me go to countries Abroad , France , Sweden , England , Canada . <EOS>
I will stop there for now , I returned in 1972 finding problems which we will talk about and which we know about the war . I went to Burundi and Congo . In 1994 after the war had ended Here is when I returned , and now I am here , I have said this in a few words , that is how I am I think that is enough so that I can be in position for what lies ahead , for the answers I might have to the questions you will ask me <EOS>
Honourable Father , what existed here before the reign of kings ? <EOS>
You have begun well , that is a very important question having the first point to what I am going to say , the history of the world and that of Rwanda like I will talk about here , is got from things I read but in brief because often when we are asked you find someone Just merely speak <EOS>
I want to tell those who will be able to hear me that what I am talking about comes from three chapters of the history of Rwanda . I will start from the first chapter , and what happened before that . The history of Rwanda we know , in French it is math , archaeology and fossils that scholars found on earth that told them the history before man could write , I think that you all heard about it . <EOS>
The first human on earth in the bible is called Adam and also Eva , they say that they were in Africa , which is very close to here , our home , I will start from here . These therefore are the things We find in those fossils . <EOS>
And the other chapter in which we find history especially us Rwandans is the one which our forefathers told us , I think we all know that we find stories and many other things , names of hills but usually the source of these stories or way through which we get these ideas Of Rwandans and their true history which is with evidence are three <EOS>
The first are poems , I think you have all heard that poems exist and that they existed starting with Queen Nyirarumaga in the 16th century . Then there is the second one , royal secrets , royal secrets also Are things which started long ago with Gihanga . <EOS>
the royal secret keeper of the ancient Basinga clan who was called Rubunga who was the one who brought royal secrets to the Banyiginya clan and told them to Gihanga , which resulted in that Ritual of continuing to teach the royal secret keepers during the reign of the Banyiginya clan . <EOS>
What existed before kingdoms in this country ? Coming back to the scholars who base their research on fossil findings say our country , our region and Africa is where they all claim without doubt that the first human being was discovered here . <EOS>
This made them explore this place because of the fossils which revealed how the first human beings were . There reached a time when explorers came to Rwanda and Burundi . <EOS>
There is a book they wrote especially one written by a lady calley Marie Claude Van Grunderbeek , the explorer wrote a book called the first iron Rwanda therefore has good things but I will only talk about one . <EOS>
She says that in the 7th century BC , here in Rwanda , there were three kinds of people who practiced three activities @: there were people who used to hunt in the forests , there were people were cattle keepers , there were also people who were cultivators , in fact if you look carefully because there was a forest in our region , I think also in many other regions at the beginning , the first people To practice an activity , I think , were hunters . <EOS>
and you often hear that ancient human beings including the king used to hunt . There was also if you analyse the period when the forest reduced is when cattle came , like they say , when cattle graze . The thick forest is destroyed and then demolished . <EOS>
then the hoe followed , if you observe , I will come back to it , is when they begun to come up with names we are used to now like Hutu , TUTSI and Twa you see that those they called the Twa were hunters . <EOS>
those who bred and herded cattle were called the TUTSI , those who were cultivators were called the Hutu but you realize they were one people . We shall later come to see how the error of calling it Tribes came to be . <EOS>
Those are the people we know of and what existed before the time of kings , in brief that is what one can say and I think that is enough so that we continue our journey of the questions you are going to ask me <EOS>
Let me quickly ask a question , you have told us that those who were hunters were called the BATWA while others were called the Hutu and others were called the TUTSI . What made them for example the people who bred became called the TUTSI , what was considered so as to call the tribe that bred cattle the TUTSI ? <EOS>
as well as one who hunted to be a Twa ? there are things we know of which are also spoken of which may not be well known or came from the history which people do n't know well and say that those three groups of people you have told us about did not reach Rwanda at the same time there are those who say that the TUTSI came last and others who say that the Hutu reached first . Is that right ? Can you tell us something about that but starting with the question of naming , What was the reason behind it ? <EOS>
I will come to that , we shall talk about it . There is a man called Speak who brought that theory of tribes , if you are patient we shall get to it in a little while , but rather the question is how the cultivators or the breeders or the hunters came to be called tribes , If you can be patient , I will explain it to you . <EOS>
I said that they were just natives , and it is archaeology because no one saw them . It is archaeology giving an example as to why they say what they say like what we see here if we can maybe say like archaeologists who found blacksmiths . Here in this book , there are photos of hummers and small rocks , I think if it were visible one could see that there are small ropes here and pots . <EOS>
They found that the clay which the pots were made out of had cow dung , after , that dung was taken and carbon dated . <EOS>
they found that that dung was from a cow dating to that time around the 7th century . You see that they are things they based on , it 's not to say that they were called the Twa or the TUTSI by anyone or where they came from . Those assumptions that they came from somewhere else tells you that where the first person Came from , he can not say any other place <EOS>
When they say that the first human being was from Africa , close to here , the assumption that they came from somewhere else is a misunderstanding , they did not Come from anywhere , instead they came from here to other places and those who migrated were coming from here . <EOS>
To say therefore that the Hutu , TUTSI and Twa are tribes , I will explain it to you in a while and where it came from , now let us only say that where archaeologists found cow dung were cattle keepers , the hoe was also discovered . They were found in the ground and they found them not to be present day hoes but those of long ago , so there was also cultivation , there were cows , they also found jaws of cows . <EOS>
try to look closely when you are in the National museum of Butare , there is a jaw of a cow of that time which was measured . you see then that things to do with the problem of tribes , which I will answer later if you can be patient , are things which honestly came later , they came later and not at the time which people think , it is in the 7th century BC , a long time ago , they too did not know yet , saying that they lived in Ethiopia , which Ethiopia at that time did not yet have people who travelled . <EOS>
In reference to those people you have told us who were cultivators while others were live stock keepers and others who were potters , what were their cultural similarities so as to know how the inhabitants of Rwanda were related at that time . <EOS>
I beg your pardon ? <EOS>
During the reign of Gihanga , the kingdom if Rwanda had been established , what can you tell us About the way of life of the Rwandan society ? <EOS>
We shall add the second one later . Let us start with the way of life in Rwanda then the leadership of the settlement . <EOS>
The father has just finished telling us about the way of life in this region we are living in , the time before history . <EOS>
in the way of life that was discussed , we started with what he called fossils because of the second question we are going to ask him , we are now going to ask him a question in relation to the time Rwanda started to be known as Rwanda , when it started to have rulers who had their way of ruling , while ruling their people . Father , can you tell us the history of Rwanda starting from the time of king Gihanga ? <EOS>
Thank you , Gihanga , being the first king of Rwanda does not mean that Rwanda started with Gihanga . Our land like we know it from the history of Rwanda which Our forefathers tell us , I am not making up this history because I was not there . I think this is something we need to let people know , this history of Rwanda is recorded , the important history like I was saying a while ago , let me repeat it in brief , it is written in three places . <EOS>
poems truly are the first source , in the royal secrets , the royal secret keepers especially speak of how the leadership of the country is , I will come back to it in a little while of course , there were also riddles and family lineages of the kings and how they succeeded each other like the queens and the tribes of Rwanda which were called also went succeeding each other on the throne <EOS>
It started therefore like we said a while ago that here in Rwanda , they found a long time ago , before Jesus , hunters , livestock keepers and cultivators . After some time they came together and became many , then they ruled so as to live together , if one is to explain it properly , one can start from how the society of Rwanda started , I will also add on how It came to give birth to a kingdom . <EOS>
that is ok. A family as we know it is a man or a boy and a girl who come together and give birth to children . While the Rwandan family is still small , be it three people that is man , woman and children before they are married is called a home , that you know . After the homes have become many to the level of grandparents , they are called households after the households had become many and populated , one would go and live over there on the hill . <EOS>
you all know that the children , on the hill , would settle next to him as he went on taking over . Hills while he still had strength . <EOS>
and get his own portion of land . When the houses become many , they were then called clans , those clans would have an area in which they lived and also ruled , protecting their land and property , later it came to be called a kingdom , that is how kingdoms came about . <EOS>
Later on after the kingdoms had become numerous with clans , I think you know about kingdoms made up of clans we hear about them , we find them especially in this book by father Kagame , it is the one I wanted to show you called Inganji Karinga , It is where he showed us where the Banyiginya clan begun their reign with Gihanga , it is in this book that we are told the kingdoms which were in Our region , which was later called Rwanda . <EOS>
the kingdoms that existed around the time of Gihanga , in the Baziga clan which we now call Bubari is in the nation park , also in Ndowra was the reign of the Bashambo , you realize that it is the kingdom of the Bashambo it was over there in Kibungo , Gisaka , of the Bagesera , here in Nduga , there were the Babanda and here where we are seated also Were others and in many other places . <EOS>
Gihanga begun his rule by trying to bring together all those small kingdoms made up of clans , he started by working together with others but you realize they begun from a home to household to clans , a clan does not mean what we term it as that is to say Hutu and Tutsi , tribe meant what is called clans , those were tribes . This has led me to show you another book which talks about it clearly . <EOS>
As you can see this book which is called ‘ Les Clans of Rwanda ’ was written by a white man called Marcel Bertefert . What is good about this book is that he did research in every prefecture in the country and he found they were similar to names of clans , the word tribe in French is clans , 19 clans . In those clans therefore there is what we called tribes which is false , there are The Hutu , Tutsi and Twa in every tribe . <EOS>
What are the clans therefore ? Giving an example , the banyiginya , that is a clan , amongst the Banyiginya , there are the Twa , Tutsi and Hutu . What are clans ? there are the Bega , amongst the Bega , there are the Hutu , Tutsi and Twa . The Basinga is a clan made up of Hutu , Tutsi and Twa . There is no tribe without those two parts . I have not yet spoken on the Hutu and Tutsi , I will talk about it in reference to a man named Speak but that has nothing to do with talking about blood clans . <EOS>
that is how it was . a family had a head , a parent those heads of every family , family in this case means household , in the clan they were ruled by their leader who headed the whole family and was called the king , the king is to say the popular one in ancient Kinyarwanda , to be famous is like being popular . later the king of the Banyiginya who was called Mukobanya , Kigeli Mukobanya the 1st . <EOS>
he gained the wisdom of never again sharing with children , before they used to go together and they would be Let 's say like the Basinga or especially like in Gisaka . In Gisaka is where it took long to be part of Rwanda because it became part of Rwanda during the reign of Rwabugiri the 3rd . Mukobanya is the one who started conquering countries and colonizing them by putting his own rulers , he went bringing things together , that is what gave birth to Rwanda . <EOS>
before they were just small kingdoms , Rwanda was only made up of the Banyiginya but it was not a kingdom when it had just annexed others , Rwanda existed but together with others relatives , and came together with others . Mukobanya is the one who worked together with others to get things for himself . <EOS>
That is where the word to escape from Rwanda originated from and he then established the Rwanda of Gasabo . When you see the way I put together a society and kingdom...it begun as a society , society came from home and as it grew to become a large kingdom , it became many small kingdoms , the banyiginya came and Brought together those small kingdoms after winning them in battle and made them a united kingdom . <EOS>
Mukobana is the one who brought that ideology of one nation , he established a government of course , I can not go through the whole government except that there was a king who ruled together with those he shared with the leadership . There were the commanders of the army guarded the whole country . <EOS>
but concerning the country 's wealth , there were heads of wealth , that is to say those who looked after the resources , there were also cultivators who headed all cultivators who was known as the head of the land . There were three branches of government , they did not put a government for hunters , often they all were hunters especially in the royals who hunted more than others , potters also moulded of course but that did not mean that they were leaders . <EOS>
and those who were potters . That was the government . I will talk about how it later came to be removed , later when white men came , they removed that government which was of three branches and made it one , they became chiefs , assistant chiefs and others but that is something else . That is what I can say on how the government of that time was there was something similar to democracy because the king , after they had One government when the Banyiginya clan had conquered , that is Nganji Karinga . <EOS>
After the Banyiginyahad conqured other kingdoms , of all those kings that existed , after Inganji Karinga had conqured others , they looked for a way of woking together with societies which were strong , there were societies called Ibibanda , Ibibanda are the ones who give birth to the royal family . In the ancient royal family to be honest , the king came from the Banyiginya clan but had queens who resembled , the queen With whom he shared the throne had a clan from which she came from . <EOS>
Let me give you an example on queens starting from there , at the beginning I said that the first keeper of rayal secrets was from the Musinga clan , it therefore resulted in the queens sharing the throne with the would be Banyiginya clan . The first ten queens were from the Basinga clan who included Nyamususa the wife of Gihanga Ngoma Ijana . They were succeded by the Bega clan because something happened that seemed to be a mistake , which was called Rukumbi first rescued ... and therefore In order to punish her , they removed their queens from the throne . <EOS>
sFrom Rukumbi therefore , from Ruganzu Bwimba , the Basinga clan never ever became queens exept Nyirarumaga who we shall talk about her , is the only one who became queen , a queen who was ahelper because the mother of Ruganzu had died . You see then that The king was from the Banyiginya clan , queens were from the Bibanda clan , there were 10 from the Basingwa clan . <EOS>
From the Bega clan there were 10 and after there came the Bakono clan , then the Baha clan , then the Bagesere clan , then the first from the muzigaba clan was a true Muzigaba , it was a way in which they included something similar to democracy of today . You see therefore , I can not say it in many words but the ancient rule had something similar to democracy , there was unity , there was especially in the general leadership of the army which one may call administration of today , it is like the government of today but there is a government concerning three resources of the country , livestock breeders and cultivators . <EOS>
That is what came to give birth to the words that clans are not calms because nobody was only a cultivator , nobody was only a livestock breeder , no society was only made up of livestock breeders and another made up of cultivators only , that is a lie , we were related and one would become a cultivator and another a livestock breeder . In a few words I think I can stop There and maybe you can ask me anything on that . <EOS>
You have just finished telling us about the way of life in the Rwandan society and you went on to tell us a bit about the governance . I want us to therefore go deeper into the way of governance of the country . You told as that governance result from people coming together coming from families to the households which came together . <EOS>
And they became clans . <EOS>
And they became clans , you told us that the Banyiginya clan was the clan from which Rwanda came from but there were other clans in this region , and many other kingdoms here . I want you to tell us how that kingdom of the Banyiginya , that kingdom of the Banyiginya , how it went in building Rwanda . Did it go capturing other kingdoms , how did they capture them ? those who were captured , how were they captured ? What would those that were captured give to be part of Rwanda ? <EOS>
But we will not make it long , it is in brief . Speaking in a few words , if I talk about how they went about with it , often they went to war , you know that long ago in Rwanda , there was something called an army , they were called an army and they came times of war <EOS>
all Rwandans were part of the , army when they heard that Rwanda had existed for long , the first weakness is that it all depended on the army . The army had heads of government . Every Rwandan belonged to a certain group of the army , therefore had many responsibilities but the most important was to fight for the country but there were many other things like dance , like doing all other duties , But they included fighting for the country . <EOS>
be it to stand for it or save it when it has been attacked . If you take a close look what the Banyiginya were better at than others was the wisdom of knowing how to safe guard the country and how to fight . They went therefore capturing small kingdoms while adding them to others and maybe they had better leadership like sharing and interacting , so how did they rule so as to govern them ? first of all is that they would go and remove them from leadership but Share with them . <EOS>
they would share with them and put in place appropriate ministries which were organized . I can not say How of course , let 's say they put in place a ministry for army basing on how it is in the whole kingdom . The Rwandans used to teach how to fight , I think even now it is still in our blood , they used to breed livestock , they really knew how to breed cows in that up to now some still do , maybe things to do with cultivating were few but they had it too <EOS>
when the Rwandans would go to war they would bring crops which they had gotten from other places , they told us of how sweet potatoes came , how they introduced peas . I think most of the things resulted from their leadership which better than others at conquering . I can not explain it all without Spending the whole day because there are other things which follow and require a lot of time <EOS>
The next question is on the history during the colonial time but before we go to the colonial time , there is a question I wanted to ask which I feel lays ground for the next question of the colonialists . History tells us that Rwanda probably begun <EOS>
from Rwagasabo which was one hill . The hill of Gasabo , is there something you can tell us about it . The white man found extending to Rwicanzizu , Rwanda had grown big and extended to Masisi , it was very large . I therefore want that maybe we first answer the question of Rwanda 's history , there reached a time of colonialists in 1897. can you tell us how Rwanda was changing And developing , as new people came , how far had Rwanda reached ? <EOS>
I think it is better for us to have a few questions because we have a long way to go . Let us talk about things like the conquests of Rwanda , is to say that I had to start because they begun around ... how they were and things would be going too far ? Let this be an opportunity for Mr to tell you about this book I have so far told you about three books about clans , this book ‘ L' histoire du Rwanda Precolonial ’ , I wrote it a few years ago in 2003 , that is where I compared many things which are not even in this one of Kagame . <EOS>
If you take time and look at what went on , there is a way the Banyiginya clan had their way of life and their knowledge in what they called Royal secrets , what you can call the constitution today , look at ‘ Constitutionnel ’ , is a book I am writing now which is about to come out . If you read that book you find the laws they went by so as to safe guard , stand for and save the kingdom , to save in terms of capturing other kingdoms , in terms of Supporting it and also culturally . <EOS>
All that is in what they called the path , there were 18 paths , royal secrets are in those 18 I am telling you , there are 10 to do with wealth . Let 's say for example rain , when the rain became too much , there was a path of Kivu , the path of Kivu was a way the king had to do rituals so as stop the rain , there was also the path of Rukungungu when there was death as a result of too much sun shine , they would find a way in which the king would have a ritual to bring down rain , they had a way of praying to God and the rain would stop Every time there was a problem . <EOS>
The king had a way of solving it . Most of it concerns the wealth of Rwanda , there was also the path of war , a path of Muryamo , and also there was in those royal secrets let us say laws , laws they followed so as to fight against attacks on the country or to find a way of benefiting Rwanda in every way , that included the way how the kings succeeded each other , that is what I told you , it is too lengthy for one to tell it all unless One gets a book and reads it . <EOS>
Let us talk about kings , kings had a way in which their names reflected their responsibilities . There were two kings , one was called Kigeli and the other Mibambwe , there duty mainly was to conquer for Rwanda . That was Kigeli 's duty , whenever he was on the throne , he had to conquer for Rwanda and his son too who was succeeded by the one called Yuhi , Yuhi was one who brought peace and security and he was also involved in thing to do with activities and all others which involved resting and others . There were others for milk , the ones called Kirima and Mutara brought plenty to the kingdom , that is why Mutara is place of cows , that is where that name came from . <EOS>
That leads us to things concerning how the kingdom had to move forward . You were asking how kings Let 's say amongst those kings who went far in what you were saying to benefited Rwanda . First there were those called Ruganzu , they were to be fighters of Ruganzu , the first was Ruganzu Mpimba and Ruganzu Ndoli . That name was removed from the history because those who were named after it ... it made them lose their lives . One was Mutabazi Ruganzu Mpimba and another was killed , Ruganzu Ndoli and they were removed because it was cursed . <EOS>
There remained the one that was Kigeli 's last first name , those were the ones who especially Kigeli the second Nyamuheshera , Nyamuheshera is the one who went far up to Rwacanzige but the other is Ruganzu , Ruganzu Ndoli is the one had many things and reached as far as Congo . <EOS>
he is the one who reached Bukavu , he reached far but he went intending to fighting then the Bashi who were also called the Banyabungo long ago . There was Yari Gahima , he is the one who conquered those areas and others , therefore you see that if one starts to talk about everyone and what they did , it will be lengthy , I can not say it all , but you realize that they had that plan of conquering for Rwanda and that is what it means , even when you look at their chronicles and think about their names , that is how they were and that is how it is in the plans . Let 's say the name Rwanda , Kigali and Gasabo , those names are similar and all have that program . Rwanda means a country without boundaries , one can ask you that how is the Rwanda abroad ? <EOS>
Anda in Kinyarwanda means a world without boundaries . Kigali means large , without boundaries , it is one Kigali , that is what they name it . You have known that the first capital here was Kigali , Rwoya which was found in at the ends of Kigali above in the ground in the woods above there . Gasabo of course is a churn of Rwanda , of milk , it 's like saying it charns Rwanda , it 's what churns milk for Rwanda . Over there in Muhazi you see that it is its tributaries . <EOS>
Thank you , continuing with our conversation with father Muzungu , we have finished talking about . I can not say that we have finished because were are following our program , we seemed to be talking about Rwanda in the time of colonialists . Can you tell us about Rwanda In colonization in the time white men reached Rwanda . <EOS>
That 's a good question , it 's in line with what we were saying , in the same way I will divide it into two parts , that concerning how locals of Rwanda were colonised and how the colonialists took over power in Rwanda , I think that 's better . Let me start with the locals of Rwanda , how were they colonized ? that 's where our problems started because the white man came with foreign ideology <EOS>
There was a British man called Captain John Honing Speak who came to our Africa around this area in Ethiopia and even reached Uganda , then saw people of the Hima tribe , Babito tribe and then reached here and saw the Rwandans especially the Tutsi who of course looked like the Hima who were cattle keepers . After seeing this he thought that the Tutsi were not Rwandans but from up there in Ethiopia , from the Bagara , that they looked like the Bagara who were the cattle keepers and drunk milk <EOS>
Milk has an effect on one who takes it . He brought about the mentality that Rwandase were not the same , that some that is the Tusti came from up there and that the Hutu are like the other Africans from around , he brought about that mentality they are not from around this area , he gave us that mentality , we all thought were from around here without discriminating that this is an African or a Kenyan or Tanzanian or Abisinya <EOS>
He brought that . Other priests and white men with whom he was believed him and when he went back to his home he wrote a book talking about that trip he took to Africa and in the 9th chapter of that book talked about Rwanda in other words his discoveries here in Africa called AUX SOURCE € S DU NIL in French , a book was written in France called Aux Sources du Nil <EOS>
Here I have a book by a white man called Alexander Arnold , a white priest , he wrote this book called LES PERES BLANCS AUX SOURCES DU NIL ; he is one of the people who took on Speak 's ideology and he made it a rule , Speak said that it was just a thought but those that copied it believed that the Tutsi were not real Africans and that they came from up there <EOS>
there is another book by Albert Pages entitled ‘ AU ROYAUME HAMITE AU CENTRE DE L' AFRIQUE ’ , that is where they all support ‘ Au Royaume Hamite au Centre de L' Afrique . ’ that is where I said that the Himites of here or the reign of the Banyiginya or Rwanda of the Tutsi but I honestly do not think it 's the Tutsi but Rwandans . <EOS>
That it the Hamites who made it up , and the rest followed suit and they used that ideology to divide us into tribes , books that were written especially on Rwanda are many . Another was one written by Rochanoine de l' Axge , you will hear about it , they might also used it as reference . Whoever wrote this book said that Rwanda has 3 tribes that 's how they started . <EOS>
Among the 3 tribes were the Twa , the Hutu and the Tutsi , it must have been him who brought that ideology that they do not come from the same place , and they forgot that since the 7th century they lived here and the first were the cattle keepers , one can say that the Tutsi are the cattle keepers , those who were called the Hutu were cultivators and the Twa hunters , this is what Speak said and everyone followed this <EOS>
It was followed by everyone else . When colonialists came , there came another problem , colonialist of two different kinds @: there came those whom I call of the trouser , that is to say civilians but there were also of the dress that is the priests . They came in collaboration with the priests and wanted them to help the rule Africa properly , tell us about these people and the African we can use . And others said "@ is that what is difficult ? We shall help you <EOS>
there are people , the Tustsi who have acknowleged that they are a tribe that was made up by someone , join hands with the Tutsi , they know how to govern so asks them your helpers . @" that 's when there came a change in the leadership in 1926 and 1927 of a resident called Mortohani , he removed the deputy chiefs of before who were the Germans , that time that man dismissed 30 Twa deputy chiefs , that time leaders were not supposed to be Hutu or Twa , so in that reform the Twa chiefs were dismissed and their list can be found at Shyorongi <EOS>
And dismissed all Hutu and even Tutsi who were short , and only the tall Tutsi were left saying that they were the only ones who knew how to govern . <EOS>
And can help the white man to govern and they will be rewarded with wealth a live comfortably . They were helped in this by the priests because the priests were put in place to educate the Africans , to treat them and they were the ones who initiated any form of development like building houses , they were the ones while building their quarters who brought bricks and they were the ones who started road construction . The priests were able to help because they were the ones who brought Christianity and started teaching families about it . In their teachings they started up leadership schools , until it got to a time when the colonialists would take over leadership since they were always on the side lines <EOS>
How do you think they made the locals leaders and how did the Rwandans react to this ? that 's what I want to tell . First of all they removed the Rwandan form of governance , where by the king was the over all ruler of the country , they removed the king and replaced by Leopold who was a white man , and they would continuously refer to him as the king ignoring our king . The leaders became servants so that they could show that it is that and those who were doubting stop doubting . <EOS>
the king who was there was Musinga and when he did not agree with them they chased him away and he died in Congo where they sent him after they realised that Kmememba where they had sent him at first was n't far enough and he died at Moba <EOS>
They replaced him with his son Rudahigwa , who had to agree that he was to be governed by the white man and was thus baptised . The priest Classy had a role to play in chasing away Musinga and putting in place Rudahigwa , he had a big role to play even in consoling the Tutsi at that time who were only top officials . <EOS>
That is when they came up with identification papers . <EOS>
they wrote that a person was either Hutu , Tutsi or Twa , you could find that a Tutsi with ten cows was Tutsi but one with less than ten was made a Hutu and those with non were Twa . Those then became tribes , and it run in ones blood , let me say . So what was just an activity became a tribe , that is how it came about , then the leadership became like that . They became our leaders and that is when things changed , they gave power to some yet in the past we all used to share power , it is written and I can show you the book right now . <EOS>
Those who rejected it , who were Twa assistant chiefs are known , I can show you their names . The Hutu were also many and we know them , the important rulers of the king , Bisangwabyarugombibituri were Hutu , and the Twa were also ... , I think you heard about it . The second thing I want to remind you of is that in the Rwandan culture , I child takes up the clan of the father and not the mother 's but if you make it tribes , the child honestly had to take up the mother 's tribe as well . They would have been another tribe called Ibyima for those born into two different tribes <EOS>
those who inter married , the children they gave birth to are supposed to be having a name like half cast , in fact in recent times during the first republics , they said that it was a problem and they said that there were the Husi tribe and things like that but we have lived for all these years with only Hutu , Tutsi and Twa and those who intermarried knew that they were intermarrying but it meant nothing because they thought it did not mean blood line tribes , that is truly evident , no one ever took on their mother 's tribe yet she too gives them blood . You see , to put in place the malice tribes was for what ? What the colonialists brought is that malice to change Rwandans who were from the same womb . <EOS>
and they said that they were tribes that had no relation and then it came to exist on the royal throne , and they became enemies because they are the ones who brought not sharing of power . Before they used to share but they gave it to some , it was written and we shall talk about it in a while that those they gave power came to reject it because they used to say that did not share with others . The way the ancient leadership was , they used to share things , there was something which people do not like called Ubuhake . Ubuhake is something people despised later on , work was introduced by the white man ; the whip and the prison too . <EOS>
Ubuhake existed , it was not a bad thing , it was similar to how one goes to ask for a job today . When you go to ask for a job in the government , is that serving ? if you are lucky you get to be a servant , no one ever got beaten for it and neither did anyone ever say that come and serve me , a servant would do it if they wanted to . Long ago in ancient Kinyarwanda , Ubuhake was like a ladder one would climb so as to reach those who were superior to him . what would your superior help you with ? the money of that time was cows , what did he have that you did not ? <EOS>
he could support you and fight for you . Long ago , there was not yet any kind of leadership that could speak for all people , your boss or superior would save you and could even fight for you when treated unfairly . Ubuhake therefore was a good thing at that time , the money of that time was cows and everyone including the king used to serve , even Karinga , that is what they said , the rich were the ones who were befriended because they had what was worth serving for , if you do not own anything , you can not be served <EOS>
another thing is every rich person was supposed to have a stepping stone even Rudahigwa used in Rwabutogo , everyone had someone to befriend . As we say a servant of God you 're a servant to one who is higher than you , everyone has a person who he is higher than , just like when one fails to get a job , a jobless person is like . Honestly , Ubuhake , dictatorship and whipping are not the same thing , you can ask about it if you wish but those are things the white man brought . <EOS>
And favouritism is one of the reasons as to why there are those who killed others , also it is to say that there are tribes that have nothing in common . The first and most important thing is obviously to make us their slaves , they came and took our power and made us dogs . They sent away the king and those who remained would be whipped while they were naked , they would make them lie down and whip them with no clothes on , annoying humiliation . They use to respect women but they would also tell them to kneel down and slap them , is that human ? that is what one can speak about the colonialists <EOS>
I will talk about how they came and what resulted from it , the riots of 1959 I even have a book that talks about it here . In a few words and maybe you can ask some questions but this is how I can say it . <EOS>
I would like to ask you a question , there are many people who follow laws that are not comprehensive or that do not exist or they confuse themselves about certain things because they do not understand . The king Musinga was exiled in Kamemba because he did not agree with the white man and after that as you told us they sent him into exile in Moba in Congo . It 's clear that there were some things that they did not agree on . <EOS>
it 's possible that there is a time that they told him to do this and that and he did not understand how that would help the Rwandans that he governed . Can you explain to clearly the differences Musinga had with the White men to the extent that they sent him into exile <EOS>
I think it 's a bit clear although I think the first and most important thing is that Musinga was accustomed to being king , so to say that from today on wards you are not a king , you are a slave is not an easy thing . He did not therefore take it very well because he did not agree to it to . It 's understandable because you can not have been a leader of a country and then be told that you are not , there is no way you can agree . That distressed him and he did not agree , secondly they wanted Musinga to be Baptised and yet he was accustomed to our beliefs in God and they said that it 's nonsense . <EOS>
And go to church , he could not understand that because it was not his faith and indeed that religion of God had no fault and they removed it and up to now it makes no sense . Even I as a preist I 'm one of the people who fought this . They came and said that our faith was based on idolatry and wrote about this in a book called "@ God is our father @" fighting this . They came and changed the name of God and said that it was "@ mungu @"@ . We fought against this and won , "@ mungu @" was removed and reinstated "@ imana @" and showed that we black people had a religion ; they used to say that we did no religion until we affirmed this to the Pope and the acknowlged that Africanas had a religion . <EOS>
After writting the book , "@ God is our father @" where at taught at the university in Kinshasa , I asked the students and found out that all the blacks in Africa especially in the Sahara belive that there is something that created heaven and earth and they give several names but we called it God and we have this in common ; we did not worship idols . That distressed Musinga because they insulted him and told him that he worshiped idols but a wise man like Musinga could not accept this , I wanted to say that they kept the truth from him because he could not accept this and even his son merely took it because he believed that if he did not accept it he would end up like his father <EOS>
On merely accepting this , the first thing he did was to be baptised , and accepted that Rwanda should worship Jesus , I 'm not saying that I 'm against it but that was Musinga 's biggest crime , his removal from power and forcing the white mans religion that he did n't understand on him and calling him a fool , he was n't a fool he had his own God and honestly it was a true God and Jesus did not come , instead came saying that I have not come to remove but instead I have come to affirm it . I wrote a book later , "@ I did not come to abolish but to affirm @" I did not come to remove what God had put in the hearts of your fore fathers and what they knew but I have come to fulfill it . <EOS>
You see Musinga was a victim of the truth , and that he was wise amd he was a man of honest character , colonialists came saying that we were stupid and had no brains , that we were animals and that was hard for him to accept and that was his crime . that 's what I think , other things maight have been because they wanted one who was easy going , baptized and willing to learn the white man 's things but he was old and they found that they could not get along with him . <EOS>
If you take a look at africa , Rwanda and burundi were not the only countries that were colonised , other countries too were colonised . But you find that it was especially Rwanda and burundi that had problems because even though the white man came , Rwandans had away of ruling eachother , they had away of life and I ask myself , what made it possible for the white man to divide or to come up with with tribes amongst Rwandans so as to divide them into pieces or like you said use the Tutsi to rule for them . <EOS>
So why did they choose theTutsi because yuo realise that the most of the problems we have today are from the colonial time because the white man made up somethings to help them with their plans but why did it happen in our countries ? the example I can give on only Rwanda and burundi is that we were the only ones who had good leadership and they saw that they could not just penetrate us like in other countries . <EOS>
I would have answered that later because we shall come to things of 1939 . <EOS>
Our misunderstandings are those things that came to be but I will come back to that problem in a while . Honestly , if you take a close look at where they came up with tribes like you have said clearly , they came up with these tribes elsewhere but the problem became more complicated in the time they wanted independence . That is why I was proposing to talk about it later because they came up with tribes here but they came up with other things elsewhere . <EOS>
But they made up all these things so as to not grant independence , you will ask me that question in a while , instead you can ask me another question on the colonialists . There is another common question concerning the priest you categorize amongst the colonialists and things like that . There is another question concerning the Catholic church <EOS>
We were talking about the colonial period , we were talking about the leadership in Rwanda , what it was capable of and how it benefited the countrymen , I think that is what you told us . And even now when you tale a close look you realise that in that time there were two parts , the catholic church , the priests seemed to also be involved in those things together with those white men who came . I think you can explain that to us as well . Those white men who included the first missionaries , are they the ones who helped so as to achieve the goals the priest had of changing the beliefs of people and baptising them ? <EOS>
If you look closely you realise that along the way the catholic church or should I say the priest did not behave propery because they evidently showed crookedness , what was meant to be teaching people the word of God became politics and things did not go well . I do not know what you can tell us in regards to the priest and church . <EOS>
So as to simplify things , let us talk about it all , let 's talk about thing in 1959 because it is like talking about all these things because we shall mix things up and you will find that it is tiring . That is where we come to the priests and colonialists and ourmiunderstandings with them , It is Speak 's ideologies and what I said before about befriending but that is something they needed to use . <EOS>
they knew that they were telling lies but they honestly did not want to leave this place , they did not want to grant us independance , those are the things that became difficult as they tried not to grant independence . I think if one is to talk about that , there are many thinga that are part of it . <EOS>
The little you have told us on the colonial period , there is a question we want you to answer on the catholic church . We shall talk about the riots of 1959 and the protests . There are those who call it riots , others call it a social revolution while others call it something else . Tell us about it and those who had an active role in it . who did it ? , what was their goal ? Who were they ? <EOS>
Yes , this is the of end result of all the questions . The problem became evident the day that Africa got tired of being a slave , the time it wanted independence and stop being slaves . Many people now know the history of Africa and even read about it , that is an easy thing to talk about today . <EOS>
In the Berlin Conference , that is where the white man claimed Africa as their land to do with it what ever they wanted , they especially needed raw materials for their factories so as to make machines and every thing else that they would use . They found that Africa had most of the things they could use and they decided on how they will share the world and africa was part of it . So the colonialists came here with priests and all the archaeologists and wrote the lengthy history of the colonialist which you all know . <EOS>
There reached a time when Africa seemed to be courageous and decided that enough was enough . There was the ordinary colonisation like ours , where they were not harsh but there are those they would take abroad like to America , Asia , what they call slavery . We were lucky to have a man called Rwabugiri who they named Makare bwana Mukare who resisted and fought , but later they came . <EOS>
. In the period around 1960 , I think the first country to gain its independence was Ghana . The white man tried to find away of not granting independance , those who wanted independence started coming together and forming political parties , they were called nationalists . Most of us know that they included Nkrumah , Jommo Kenyatta , there was the king of Ethiopia Haile Sellassie . Close here we had Rudahigwa , Lumumba , Rwagasore , you know all the names . <EOS>
Often , so as to not grant idependance to africans , the white man used fellow africans and that they were good and promised to help them if they fought those dogs that were trying to wrong them . They formed political parties to help the colonialists saying that they did not need independance , saying that since Africans eat and are fed , what is the use of independence ? this is when the white man tried to find away of dividing them , blacks who wanted independence and who fought against it . <EOS>
So as to achieve their goals , they would look for a reason in every country ; at times they used religion as a way to divide people . let 's give an example of sudan where there were Arabs and blacks , Angola where it was political , that is Socialists and Nationalists . So they based on religion so as to divide the citizens , or tribes like here . They usually wanted places where it was easy to divide the people basing on their tribes and they would also have a side that could overpower the other from which they could get a majority because they always wanted to divide people . <EOS>
Into two parts because when you do this with tribes , for example if there are ten religions , there is no way you can divide them into two . They always looked for away of having two factions because no one can fight if they are many factions . They looked for something to divide the country men into two , they call it dual . Here they found that it was easier to use tribes even though they are three . They put one aside say that it meant nothing so they left the Twa alone , they considered the Hutu and Tutsi and gave one side arms and told them to fight eachother . There are places where they used religion like in Sudan . The white man always wanted something that divided the country men into two opposing sides of which they would chose one side to help them . <EOS>
That is the reason as to why they came up with tribes because it was easier . The Hutu were the majority because the poor are always the majority , if you look closesly , the Hutu , Tutsi and Twa were cartegories of wealth , and the very poor were the Twa , and those who were average were mostly leaders and they were called the Hutu , those who were very rich but few were the Tutsi . That is what they did but if there had been an easier way of dividing them into two , they would have use it . If they had found that regions were easier , that is what they would have done . Like in Sudan that is how they divided blacks and Arabs . <EOS>
It is not that they prefered the HHHutu , it 's because it was easier to divide the Tutsi and Hutu . It is evident that they came looking for those who could help then rule . They are the ones who broght the division between those who know how to rule and those who do not . The Hutu were cartegorised as dogs that did not know how to rule who were fools and had no brains , ugly and like pigs , they just ate what ever they were given . The Tutsi were the good looking ones who had brains and knew how to rule . Then those they had given power , including Rudahigwa who had collaborated , was a Christian and not been like his father , who was the first to arise among those who wanted independence . <EOS>
when he went abroad and saw what was there , the gained courage and decided that he would go to the U.N.O and ask that his country be given independance , when he gained the wisdom of seeking independance , they felt like , "@ you dog , we made you important and now this ? @"@ , "@ wait and see ! . @" they came and said that the children of the Hutu , were treated unjustly , first of all they are the knowledgable ones , they are well behaved , this country belong to them , they are the majority and that those dogs are not even true Rwandans . They needed that theory of Speak which said that they were tall , light skinned . The white men said that that is what they saw . <EOS>
They said that the county belonged to the Hutu and they said nothing about the Twa . Since they wanted independence , the white man said that the Hutu should expel the colonialists starting with the first ones who were the Tutsi , and they said that the river Nyabarongo was a short cut to sending the Tutsi back to where they came from , and that they would go after them . That gave birth to a very bad problem which got worse . <EOS>
There is a book called ‘ Mission au Rwanda , ' which was written by a white man called colonel Guy Logest who was Flemish , I know him , he was here in kigali . He came from Congo in 1959 for the first time , he was made the resident special . He removed all the leadership that was there and was colonial . He came with orders to remove those dogs who were the Tutsi and were not even Rwandans from power and put the Hutu . <EOS>
He therefore came and removed the Tutsi without any reason and put the Hutu nad he begun to burn <EOS>
This white man burnt my home in Buhoro , white men without any black are the ones who came to burn my home with shooting , what they say as 1959 ... <EOS>
In 1959 , they jokingly put things doing what they were donig , you know what was done , they killed people , burnt and chased people away ... most of these things were done by the colonialists . Kayibanda was put in place by the colonialists , I will not waste time telling you who started the parties , I will talk about the priests because they are the ones who taught about political parties . <EOS>
Let us talk about what was called Mayaga in 1959 , I talked about the main cause , the white man bitterly hated independence while they were ruling , when the king they had put asked for independence , instead of giving power to the leaders they had chosen who were the Tutsi , they found that there was no way of refusing to give them their independence without putting them against each other using tribes which they had named Hutu , Tutsi and Twa . They called them different tribes which were against each other . They also said that every bad thing that happened in Rwanda especially during their time was caused by the Tutsi be it the caining of offenders . All those things that happened because of the colonialists were blamed on the Tutsi . <EOS>
We saw that if the Tutsi had had bad leadership , they would have removed them . Instead they removed the king and put their oun king , Rudahigwa without following the Rwandan way of leadership . He was not a king who ruled , he was a worker like others headed by the administration , the name they gave him was ‘ Mwami ’ , and there was ‘ umwami ’ and ‘ mwami ’ . In fact as we were praying in the church we would say that let us pray for our king Leopord . <EOS>
We did not say that let us pray for our king Rudahigwa , we use to say that let 's pray for our king Leopord the 2nd . When it reached the time that the leaders wanted independence , they gave it to those who were not asking for it , PARMEHUTU , they forged elections for political parties and voted and built the republic of Kayibanda . The first government which they put place was made up of Hutu , Tutsi and white men and Parmehutu . What followed in that period were governments which had the mentality that the country belonged to the Hutu who were called Parmehutu and their followers . <EOS>
It resulted in the Tutsi being considered as bad and colonialists who should be killed . Those who were able to flee fled , you know that that is when refugees , burning and killing came into existence , saying that the Tutsi were foreigners . It followed in schools and places of work and it resulted in the Tutsi feeling as thoughthey were not at home . One can say that this did not get them anywhere , one can go through all these early governments of the republic if you wish that we continue . <EOS>
In the history of 1959 that you have told us , there is a man who is often talked about who maight have played a role called Peraudin . <EOS>
Peraudin was my bishop when I was a priest , he is the one who ordeined me . Father Peraudin was my superior in Nyakibanda , what I mean is that I know him . Let me not only talk about Pedoli but the catholic church . The role of the catholic church in all these things especially to with divisionism that happened amongst the Rwandans which they called tribes . I think that is better because it would be an exageration if I only spoke of Pelodi because he was not the only one involved . I told you a little while ago that the idea of there being three different tribes was written in books by the first priests . I showed them to you , one is by Pages , another is by Arnold . <EOS>
The other is ... , the other I said is by father Classe . The major role he played is saying that the Tutsi were good at leadership and the fact that he was close to king Rudahigwa . He is the one who caused the king to leave queen Kankazi . Rudahigwa remained in Nyanza but in order for the queen not to stay involved in leadership of her husband , they built for her a palece in Shyongwe close to father Classe for him to guard her from infecting her son with old ideologies . They used to say that father Classe was a friend of the Tutsi while it seemed like Peraudin was a father to the Hutu <EOS>
They based this in the letter he wrote during the fast saying that ... , love and many other things but when one is talking about the role of someone , he must speak things which are clear and honest . What I can honestly say is that Pelodi was considered to be on that side because he opposed father Classe . They say that there was a priest for the Tutsi and a priest for the Hutu but they did what they felt like , that is what I always say . I heard them say that in the time of father Peraudin , he was told by the colonialists that the Rwandans were going to gain independence and the Tutsi had been removed , like you see it 's over so chose to help Tutsis , rather help the Hutu and leave out the Tutsi . <EOS>
He was told to help the Hutu and not to give the leadersip of Rwanda to the Tutsi so as to make it suitable for you . Some say that he chose what was on mode like the Rwandans say ... that is what he did , I can not judge him because I 'm not God . However what I see that is true without deffending only Peraudin , it 's the fact that it happened when they are many priests who were working together with colonialists thinking that if they grant them independence they will expel the colonialists as well as the missionaries , you see that had that ideology in that it was even said at that time and it is written . <EOS>
It reached a point where RUNAR members and even the Tutsi , if someone tries to make sense out of it they seemed to dislike the church , the white people , the colonialists and the communist church . There was a time when it was said that priests were part of it and some of them were mentioned but Peraudin is not everyone and I can n't say that he the one who incited them . But they some who really played a role in that probably . When they talk about the catholic church in general , I think someone can think of it in two ways , it 's better . When we talk about the catholic church , you all know ; the catholic church is a community of those who are baptized and bileive in Jesus Christ and follow tha gospel , and they headed by the Pope who replaced Peter and other apostles who came after the 12 disciples of Jesus . <EOS>
The catholic church is all those who are baptized , we shall come back to that in a little while but it started from there because the genocide started from bringing hatred amongst the people . The Genocide was conceived in 1994 , it actually started in 1959 and they went on practicing it to the end . In all those times they went on saying those things , they were people of the church who wronged it . Talking about the church in general while mentioning people we know such as the leaders , whoever is called a Christian , baptized and goes to church I can call him a member of the church . In the beginning let 's start with Kayibanda to make it easy . <EOS>
Kayibanda , besides being a Christian , he was a brother , he was close to being a priest . So you can also include him amongst those members who wronged the church . Habyarimana was also a seminerian and he also had sisters who were nuns . His father was a catechist , he was from Uganda in Bufumbira and he come with priests from Rwaza , they even came to inaugurate the diocese of Rambura and then he joined the seminary . So if we said that the church wronged , Jesus would be inclusive . I just wanted to say that some members of the church are bad , indeed they did some things that brought divisions and they even got to a point of planning the Genocide . So in the group of ... Even priests are included . <EOS>
Let 's say if I give you an example maybe you can n't differentiate it from the Genocide , this had started way before the Genocide . You know that there are priests who were found guilty . I wanted to mention a few name because I can n't mention those who were not found guilty because it would be wrong . You see I did n't want to sound sure about Peraudin , and I even know other priests , I know them myself but I 'm not in position to mention any before evidence is revealed like before Arusha confirms that he destroyed his church when he was the priest in charge ... you heard of nuns who are jailed in Belgium , there are priests who are in jail , I can n't accuse him but there those I know myself who even wanted to have me killed . <EOS>
But I can not mention him because he is not yet found guilty , you may say I 'm telling lies . Let 's say like in churches , the role of the catholic church I 'm telling you that is obvious and makes me sad and I even say it . Tell me , even if someone said it and repeated it , I mentioned it earlier and explained it on the radio . let 's talk about what happened in Rwanda like during the time when the laws of PARMEHUTU that talked about what agreed on . let 's talk about the time the Radio gave confirmation that there is an enemy with a name . Let 's say like there is a bishop Focas , you heard of him NIKWIZE he said that a Tutsi is naturally bad and he knows that character is created by God and no one disagreed amongst those bishops disagreed with him so that he says , one with whom we share God we do n't share a word , it 's exaggerating . <EOS>
I was a refugee for 27 years , bishops used to write in books saying that there is no more room in Rwanda , that those who left should look for room outside the country . You know that every has has right in his or her country , in fact if the country has nowhere to settle its people , it looks for a solution . You would hear radio stations like RTLM saying such things like while people are listening . <EOS>
Priests would lead mass and though they had heard these things , none of them would speak against it in what they taught by saying that those things are not possible , let us rise up and tell the government that what it is doing is not right , Because were believe in God , we reject those things or maybe write a book against what Kangura had written or even write to the president and say that radio station is causing division , you should silence it . These things did not happen , like me saying that it is a bad thing or the church . But you see that I have not said the catholic church only , I 'm saying the church as a whole , those who speak for the church should have , at a certain point said no. <EOS>
when you take a close look , they were small writings but nothing solid reflecting that the catholic church or Christians that a particular mission or that priests or Christians had a meeting or a walk to show that priest , Christians or other people manifested it , no one went and stood up against what they had previously heard on the radio . What I am saying is that the catholic church and their leadership were not brave . Jesus would whip those who made the house of God unholy , in fact they killed people from churches and we simply kept quiet and run away . <EOS>
I am not saying that there are no people in the church that were holy , they are there including amongst the bishops , there are those who rejected it and it 's there in what I write . There are those who clearly said it like bishop Bigirumwami and many others but in general that is what I despise . There are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where I always say we failed including myself because I am a catholic and a bishop . <EOS>
We failed , we could have been like saint Peter and cried that we have failed in our place . I once spoke on the radio when we were being asked , I said that if someone...meaning the catholic church ... They killed people while we were watching and what did we do ? If you fail to fight it until maybe it even kills you , the one who left you with his cow , whenever he sees you and you run away , will never leave with others again . At least he says you are useless , let 's not say anything more . This is where I can say the role of the catholic church was and it was something which was openly rebuked . <EOS>
After that period of riots we talked about in 1959 , it resulted into many things . One of the results were republics , we know the first and second republics . Those two republics existed from 1961 to 1994. we want you to tell us about those republics not like people who read about it in history but saw it with their eyes . <EOS>
I will speak of it in a few words because we all know about it now . The first republic honestly seemed to continue with the programs of the colonialists . Let 's talk about Kayibanda , he cause divisionism among the Rwandans which gave birth to refugees like I said , it gave birth to tribalism in schools and at work places , and even in 1972 when Habyarimana wanted to over throw Kayibanda and he told lies that the Tutsi had again rioted but the truth is that he had made it up so as to find a way of overthrowing him . When Habyarimana came in , what he added was tribalism and regional discrimination . The other thing he added was the planning of the genocide . <EOS>
They used to go killing people here and there and there is a way they referred to them , I will talk about it in a few minutes , what did they mean by the cockroaches are coming ? they started killing people here and there and you could see that they are training to see it if can be possible , if there is someone who could do it without fear , if it would have no consequences or if it can actually happen . How I can say in few words then , at first both republicans followed the plan of colonialists and fulfilled it and went on towards Genocide . It means to separate Rwandans , a Tutsi is not Rwandan and that he has to die . And then they came up with a way of talking about him , the way he is , that he is bad , in all the ways they painted him to be a bad person and they taught it to others and it went into all kind of teachings that we know but they come to make it understandable that he does n't deserve to live . Basically I can say that that 's where it reached in few words . <EOS>
I have a question on the republics , When you look at the first republic and the one of Kayibanda . Kayibanda was given power by the Belgian colonialists . Kyibanda was there for some time then Habyarimana toppled him . Then the only thing I want here as someone who was there but when I look at this and the life in the genocide of 1994 , there is a way Kayibanda was given the power but he would rule with them but when Habyarimana come to power , when he toppled it . He had lived with French people . There are two things ; Belgians look like the people who created that thing of hatred among Rwandese , conflicts started and people started fighting each other . <EOS>
Then after the republic of Kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the Belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in Rwanda and then Habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the French who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 . In a way , up to today you see how the French were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the Belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all . Is there anything you can say about that ? <EOS>
That 's really a good question because I used to think about it a lot . It 's true after the Belgians were defeated during colonialism ; it was taken away from them , the white leaders left . The French wanted to take over . Basically they did n't want to give it all up . <EOS>
Even if the French have many tricks , all the countries they colonised they gave them up without truly giving them up . They put something which seemed like their hand that was always there . They looked for something the Belgians seemed to have failed at , that is how I view it . But the French people worked together with Habyarimana and even others . Truly French people , the way it is , are wise who are generous . When Belgians granted independence it looked like they have given it out and nothing behind it but there would be something that would keep them around , they used the black leaders or the ones from Asia because there are leaders but they were still there too . Here and in Burundi and in Congo as well . Because Belgium is a small country when they granted it they meant it but the French were thought that you can n't just let them go just like that yet Congo has riches . <EOS>
They came and replaced them , the French wanted a way of replacing Belgians because of the French language so as to add them on other French countries . So let 's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by French long ago . it 's like they replaced Belgians so that they do n't just let us go . It 's as if they replaced them yet they had n't agreed on it . They did n't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that . Actually whenever we disagree with the French , Belgians do n't mind it , it makes them come back saying they got they took their place . I guess that 's how I understand , it I did n't really think much about it . Belgians left but the French refused since they did not go anywhere at all , instead they said this time since Belgians are leaving . Let 's put that little thing back in our pockets . Basically the francophone 's . They told Habyarimana that first all you are still young , it 's French language now . <EOS>
They got close to him and convienced himto come . They told him not to worry that they were bringing wisdom and they were going to fight against the Tutsi , they are the ones who do n't want to grant independence and there is nothing else , it was easy . Habyarimana as well had nothing against them because he used to say that you are nice people , we speak French . I think it 's because French people replaced Belgians and made us francophones . Habyarimana was pleased with them and they would give him all he needed , that 's how I understand it . <EOS>
There is something else that people say so often about Kayibanda . The fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not Rwandese and killing Rwandans meant nothing to him . Then he used it to bring conflicts among the Hutu and Tutsi with the help of the white man . Kayibanda was really not Rwandan . <EOS>
Well , they are two things , saying that he is not Rwandans , I will answer it but saying that he made it up I think I 've just talked about it , we heard where saying that they is not Rwandans came from , he is not the one who started it . Kayibanda did n't start it , he also found it like that and he accepted it , that the Tutsi are not human beings . Kayibanda , if am not mistaken , his father was Nkangura who came from Bukavu and he even came with his brother ; basically there were two men one called Nkangura and his brother the father to Rwagasana . They came this side during the time of King Musinga and they became servants and even Nkangura , the dad of Kayibanda became a servant of a man called Birasabyakanyemera , chief Birasa was still a young man . He became his servant and he served him , he served him when he was in Nyanza school . After Birasa took his portion in Kamonyi , he came with Nkangura over there . I think that 's when Kayibanda was born . <EOS>
Then the time Birasa went to become a chief in Nyambiriri community is when his father and Kayibanda also went to Ndiza , and Kayibanda joined the seminary . But then what 's true is that Kayibanda 's father himself was coming from Mushi . So to say that he fought and hated Tutsis just because he was not Rwandan , probably meant that he was actually not Tutsi <EOS>
He was neither Tutsi nor Hutu because he was not Rwandan . To start conficts among themselves , with help of white people , I think it was fine with him . <EOS>
It was fine with him but , he was n't going to say it because it would not be easy to say he was a foreigner and he is bringing conflicts . Maybe he is the one who would be the one to say that you are not Rwandan too however , he was supposed to hide that I think . Maybe he did n't mind it but I do n't think the fact that he was from Bukavu was enough for him . <EOS>
that 's what I 'm saying . I am saying that he felt like first of all he was not Hutu neither was he Tutsi . To create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all Rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him . <EOS>
No , it 's not him . If you want you can say it but I think it 's not the important thing really , it 's not important . I guess Tutsi , let me tell you the good reason especially why he disliked the Tutsi . His dad came and served Birasa , maybe he was mistreated , it 's possible that he has something against the Tutsi who disrespected him , maybe the Tutsi who his chief or his master , I do n't know . Another thing , there is something that made Kayibanda hate the Tutsi , only that you do n't know but he suffered from something , I know he had bad background in the school , he suffered from ............... , you can imagine ...... the hatred of Tutsis had it 's origin . He was sick of ........ , then that sickness of ..... in school but that one I 'm not sure if it was supposed to be mentioned here . He used to fall sick of ..... but then really it 's not something good . <EOS>
What I know is that in school , the priest , the bishops , I am a priest so I know Peraudin it 's like I was his boss some time back . He really did n't like being disrespected . So to say that the Tutsi used to be disrespectful is something that was common in the time of colonialism , they spread it all over that the Tutsi were disrespectful , so he did n't like it . That 's why he created conflicts among them , saying he is not part of them and they are actually not even his brothers , so let them all die . Any way , if you want you can even say that with Habyarimana , those issues are mentioned . He is also a foreigner if you do n't know , he is a mufumbira . Did you know the meaning of the word mufumbira , do you know that the kitchen helpers who are cooks are called the bafumbira . It started with his father , he came from the Bufumbira land and came as a cook of the priests , it went on and that 's how they called them Bafumbira . They are helpers called Bafumbiras from Bufumbira . If you want you can also say that brought conflicts among Rwandans because he 's not Rwandan but that would be exaggerating . He actually brought conflicts so he can have the power , no one can say that he did because he did n't go against the killings among Rwandans . I too can n't tell if that 's the true reason . I can n't confirm that . <EOS>
I think you can go on telling us about the attacks of the refugees . The ones who died because of being called their agents , how did it go ? I think even that would be part of it , truly , the Genocide of 1994 itself ... <EOS>
some of the causes of the genocide , leaving out the white man because it 's something that someone can add , it seems like the trigger were the attacks of the refugees , the attacks of the refugees started with the Nyenzi who I think came as a number of times especially in 1963 , that came up to Kanzenze terrorising and then the people from here started ..... every Tutsi , that 's a long story and I think repeating it would be hard , I think other refugees that attacked ....... Who were strong were Inkotanyi , I will talk about it hurriedly because we shall talk about it again . <EOS>
The time Inkotanyi was scary especially for the people from around here . They fought at the border , they were pushed back the first time in 1990 , and then there came agents . Every Tutsi was called an agent and some would be put together over there in Nyamirambo , you can see that all this contributed to the eruption of the Genocide . I can remember a priest who once found me in Kinshasa , I do n't remember the year but it was before genocide and after 1990 , he told me that , tell your relative , s as if they are under my control , not to attack because if they do , no single Tutsi will be found in Rwanda , so I said that those who are out of the country should stop trying to come back home so that the ones who decided to stay in the country will not get killed . <EOS>
Honestly , the leaders of here felt that it was a big crime to keep refugees out . There is no other way , those who are in the country will be eliminated but then they could n't even eliminate them properly saying that they leave them to consume their property and maybe they should n't have any part in power and so they pursued them . If they shared with them a little and let them eat their part they would n't have been refugees . So when they heated up , like a threat to those leaders of MRND and the political parties that used to help them , and again because they were segregationists , that generated multiple political parties . <EOS>
He wanted a government based on multiple political parties which scared MRND even more , that 's also something someone should add on , multiple political parties together with the refugees became new refugees of Inkotanyi . <EOS>
Fighting tribalism seemed to the be the cause of the war or the Inkotanyi.....and other political parties and MRND with its descendant CDR got scared when they found out there was no other way but to get rid of all those who disagree with them , I think this should be mentioned as well ...... of Arusha that time Inkotanyi realized it could not work out , they did n't have mercy and they kept on killing here and there ; they kept on moving forward untill they were close to here , that 's how we know it . Afterwards the white men said that , those Inkotanyi are unstoppable and you can no longer chase them away , they have reached at the entrance of Kigali so you should agree with each other . <EOS>
I think that that is when Habyarimana and his followers and the other political parties that had the same ideology of sharing the power went to the peace talk of Arusha , as whole planning of genocide went on slowly by slowly up to the time it was triggered , it reached a point where Habyarimana accepted but you could see that he did n't really accept , they said it and he said it in writings , others said that they were going to plan a genocide and then you could see them sign papers without meaning it . <EOS>
They signed without signing ; basically you find that Arusha is the one that pushed the trigger ..... so the plane of Habyarimana which was blown up I really do n't know who did it wish he could be known but I wanted that instead of the refugees that wanted to go back in the country and it could n't happen and they applied force then they looked for a way force should not be used and they started peace talk which also reached a point and they rejected it saying that they can n't share with refugees , we can n't share with Inkotanyi so let 's look for a way of defeating them .... With those who help them and their agents . But its starting point then is cause even the others who help them are these political parties . <EOS>
.... but the trigger of it all is the pretext of the plane of Habyarimana , I do n't know who did it but whoever it is must have been the one who wanted to bust the first bullet of the genocide ... <EOS>
I think that there if there is any other problem , I think even if someone can be can be cutting short the reason for the beginning of genocide I think , maybe you come to talk about those who wanted it and those who did n't want it . So you can understand who wanted it . Who are those who wanted it ? they are SDR members , in real sense they are the ones who wanted all that in all times the ones who were behind him , who actually helped him were colonialists . <EOS>
They are maybe few from before who helped him but mostly the last ones as in those French people we mentioned before who had read it from the time of Kayibanda so that they can go on with their colonialism . This also they are the ones who helped them , they wanted to it is obvious . The ones who did n't want to came to an understanding as well , they some who died for that . They are generally all Tutsis and also someone can include those who were against it in that time of looking for leadership in the leaders of political parties ......... if you look at the first night , they started with people like Agath who are the ones that died first . <EOS>
So I wanted to ... <EOS>
I can maybe ask you a small thing that you can tell us about or maybe as someone who did analysis on that and tried to see the difference between the genocide and others that happened before because when you look clearly you find that the killings that took place in 1962 and 1959 are very different from what happened in 1994 because people would just flee to some government institution , to places where you find churches . People would say that let 's run to the leadership , nothing will happen to us and that 's what really happened , people ran to where they could find the leadership and to churches , some of them survived . <EOS>
Just recently when the Genocide of 1994 , happened people thought that maybe they can run to places where they ran to the other time thinking they could be rescued from there but that 's not what happened , maybe the example I can give would be like places where you find churches , am talking about Christians of those churches cause people ran to them because they even used to pray from there then instead sometimes they would decide to kill them and people would die from there , what can you say about this ? <EOS>
What I can say about it is very easy , that 's what happens when someone is starting something , earlier I mentioned that ... From 1959 , there were preparations leading to that . One who discerns would sense that it was leading to nowhere else but to that . It was very clear that someone would tell where it was going to . It was all from his speech that he had just pronounced saying that the Tutsi are the enemy of the state . A priest says that Tutsis are bad in general yet he knows that man was created by God . <EOS>
They would say that he is an Ethiopian and the short cut is through the river Nyabarongo , and no one made a sound . Condemning things , what was left was to check if it 's really possible . <EOS>
..... They tried fighting back to see if really would n't work out the first time they started . When Kayibanda had just started they got them out and made them shift .... He started by trying to make an area for the Tutsi only .... And Hutu , he did n't know that it would be possible to kill them and it 's true it would n't be possible if Logist had n't come and white man had n't stood up because they knew that it was possible . They went on planning it slowly by slowly and even the people who thought it was horrible started doing it , actually that 's what happens ; what someone was terrified of goes on finding it normal and one could think that maybe when you do it you will be struck by thunder and when you do it nothing happens . <EOS>
Little by little they killed people and got stronger in 1973 , that 's when people gave it all up to god and evidently fled like the seminary of Nyundo that was all chased and had to flee , it was the first time , and was forbidden , the nuns fled , they were chased and for the first time they butchered people . They dared to butcher people in their homes . There are priests who were killed in Kabwayi . Kayibanda and bishop Peraudain were in the junior seminary , you understand that these are things that were coming little by little and people were getting used to it , whatever someone was terrified of finds that it is no longer terrifying . Slowly it reached a point where by even after doing something horrible , one says that is what they always say ..... <EOS>
Like the ending to the other bad saying ; the more they shed blood , the more you get used to it and become fearless , when one gets so used to killing , it reaches a point where he is used to blood and he becomes like an animal , it 's high time ..... <EOS>
... just wanted to ask you a question as we come to the end , genocide has just happened and come to an end it 's understandable that the Rwandan community was divided into parts , the ones who killed and the ones who survived . There was a serious problem for the people who were normally living together and then today there is Gacaca of unity and reconciliation . Gacaca can give something that can maybe make people reconcile because in that case there would be telling the truth but me the question I have here , I can say that long ago , people like you who lived in earlier years than ours of today ... Rwandese who practiced it , now I wanted you to try and compare the Gacaca of that time and that of today , do you really think that Gacaca is the solution for Rwandese to such a problem and can they live together like a Rwandan community as a whole again ? <EOS>
Traditional courts ( Gacaca ) of long ago and the ones of today can n't be the same because genocide ideology never existed then . What existed similar to Gacaca , there used to be a meeting .... Let 's say like a judgement of the communities . <EOS>
Earlier I told you that long ago Rwandese used to live in communities , families , tribes and the country and in every community there used to be leaders and important members of that community , during that time in case something like a crime would have happened , if was within the community they gathered and the one who has committed a crime would be put out in public and would confess or they would report him , he would be penalized accordingly , in case of a crime committed by an other community , Let 's say someone was killed that 's when it would like Gacaca of today , it was called "@ inzigo @" during that time they would be a revenge . That was the law and the victimized community would revenge according to this law . <EOS>
One by one but there times they would have mercy and revenge on bananas meaning ... They would cut it down and then it replaces someone but the family that killed would ask for forgiveness and ... and then the other law if revenging by killing the family in the name of revenging for theirs , they take it to the bananas so you can understand that long time many of those things existed , to punish crime and the criminal and forgiveness existed and these two still exist up to today . Gacaca firstly has a fact that they should not go easy on them as in not praising them like they used to do before . <EOS>
Bad people the bad has to be punished that 's why I hear that Gacaca to punish is really necessary so the fact that it does n't have it has to punish ... to kill ... not killing people ... basically to remove death penalty then they come to remove it and it 's removed completely is it really removed in the senate ? that 's exactly what I 'm talking about it 's being removed ..... it 's not yet over but it 's on it 's way of being removed completely ... Rwandese who died are more than one million so if they undertake that idea of saying that people can revenge the law that says that if one 's family is killed then that person kills too in revenges .... More than two or three millions . <EOS>
Then you would understand that Rwandese were about to be eliminated , it 's then necessary that whatever case they should look for something that can replace the repeated so there is no other way actually you find that it 's the right solution it 's as well the one that is possible because you can n't say that you are going to kill them , they can not let you , like that the war could erupt again and more people than the first ones would be killed it 's not even something to be done at all maybe someone can say that the way it is done is not sufficient enough . <EOS>
Maybe among the given punishments then I am one of the people who had the idea or were influential long time when they were still thinking of how it can happen especially .... They is some small journal I write that had that discussion it 's even written if they are all the same you have to remember to divide them into levels the first level .... People put it in their heads and comply with it looking for a way they can work with everyone whoever does n't is forced to comply with it they say it to him we 've said the way people managed to say and to confess that they are Christians or they are generally caring , to know that people accepted to kill others with machetes in churches . <EOS>
Why do n't I put it in God 's hands to handle things that are not supposed to even be thought about , I also said that it was mostly caused by training , there was fear it reached a pointed people were hopeless , they once told me that someone said that they were condemned that all along they were condemned .... that they will die it 's wasting time .... You were condemned you will die they were condemned it 's already done just like the way Long time a king would condemn someone with his parent to be killed saying that they have been condemned to death with his relatives <EOS>
It got a point and they said that it 's over for any Tutsi , that he should die , I have forgotten......where were we ? <EOS>
We were on Gacaca comparing the Gacaca before and that of today , if it 's true that Gacaca will be productive and make the Rwandan community rebuild itself <EOS>
yes....you understand old time things are not the same so we can say that would it be possible ? To reconcile then we can even say punishing first all even punishing itself involves those People you hear it sometimes , it includes punishing and reconciling ... there some people who have that thing of saying that Gacaca does n't punish the ones who caused it are not punished that 's the problem , the fact that I was talking about . I had forgotten about the levels of leadership that I was actually part of the ..... levels of leadership is what I had forgotten just ... are the ones who were used . <EOS>
Who are those who caused it they are the ones on top .... Who punished Habyarimana maybe whoever that warned him is the one who punished but they are many who followed it closely Let 's say the ones who helped them I 'm not saying their names so they do n't think I need anything from them , I do n't need anything from them but .... Those who helped them are known and they are mentioned in the news papers <EOS>
Those who helped interahamwe and the ones who helped in the killings are known many are not punished they are far they have means sometimes you hear Arusha many of those are not even seen Kabuga and the others are in France and they can n't be reached they are the ones who started it and they even sensitized the churches they some of them that I 've mentioned .... those who sensitized it that I 've mentioned some of them even wrote it in the books they taught it to children in schools saying that a Tutsi is bad all those are the ones who deserve to be punished more than the others where will they get from ? But you understand that it 's hard whatever the case I will chose the lesser evil . <EOS>
Gacaca is the only possible and good solution rather to reconcile is understandable .... Then to say something is to say that when you say that all Hutus killed even me sometimes I say it once in while there are times I say it thinking it 's just a saying .... Us who are going there we stand up confessing that we are Hutus and we refuse to be painted black us we are going to have a group of Hutus that confesses that they do n't agree with that and we separate ourselves from it and we are against it the people who betrayed us messed up our name <EOS>
... there is a time when I also...Genocide had occurred and survivors ... people got problems like you said , we are going to talk about these things ... <EOS>
Justice is what I wish for ... but what is painful is that they do not have the mentality that , we are Hutu , Genocide is not about tribes ... those who caused the killings are nowhere to be found ... they have not yet been caught , and those who are there ... Rwanda is not powerful , there are people who immediately ... There was also fear that if you do n't go to the barrier you will die with him , those are also in jail . I can not say that it is unfair but it is close to unfairness , but it was included by Gacaca , it ... Simplifying is part of it ... those are the ones who should be pardoned ... they caused us to hate each other and be divided , that is still a long way because it is one 's mentality..in his mind and remove that ideology . <EOS>
There are those it will n't come out of , I do not know yet what caused it , why is there a Hutu who was made to feel that his purpose is that a Tutsi should not live ? <EOS>
... it is useless to him , how will Gacaca rehabilitate him so as for him to feel that he was poisoned , I do not know how Gacaca can undo this because they taught them that bad people...There is a person born in Kajogera who used to terrorize ... <EOS>
You were telling us about Gacaca <EOS>
Gacaca will be better and it will arrive at the desired goal <EOS>
Honestly Gacaca was the best prescription <EOS>
And it 's the best , they are some things that will not be possible or that will be difficult <EOS>
But this will be solved with time continues to teach . <EOS>
And to feel that it 's not important as even to those who have will die in it , that 's where the hatred and the poison <EOS>
Come from...by speaking it kept spreading that which they had put in people 's heads <EOS>
That their enemy......is a Tutsi is poison in that to convince him that it 's not true , he will not accept <EOS>
Because he feels that the Genocide can not happen , and that feeling remains in him <EOS>
That state of heart will not be attained very soon by the Gacaca , it will come with time , people and so on <EOS>
Like the story goes , that he who time leaves behind ... <EOS>
Those generations were taught to kill for a long time <EOS>
I think it changing because now those that are being born today are being taught good things and those that were taught bad things are growing old <EOS>
I would thus like to ask the last question then we shall wind up , that 's all we will need . After the genocide <EOS>
Of 1994 , everyone who was present <EOS>
Who is alive today wishes to live in a Rwanda that is harmonious without any divisionism <EOS>
No one would like to be part of any killing like that <EOS>
I would thus like to know that if the Rwanda of tomorrow or its children being born today <EOS>
Will develop or become a Rwanda that 's doing well without any segregation . What message can you give those children <EOS>
Since they are the future of Rwanda on how they will be able to build a Rwanda that is not characterised by any form of segregation <EOS>
There is no message I can give that you do not know about , what I see is that we should follow what we are taught <EOS>
By our leaders that says that we have the same origin and are related so we should be one <EOS>
And we get the satisfaction that we deserve , most of the time that stuff about segregation was said those who did not share <EOS>
And called each other greedy <EOS>
Honestly , it is all just talk that we are related and al created by one God , especially the Christians who are many like I was saying <EOS>
Many of those that believed in God committed crimes , <EOS>
It 's to love each other , there is no other message I can give <EOS>
And to follow what encourages us to have the same vision......I have finished <EOS>
It 's education that most important and that 's where people are taught unity <EOS>
And whoever does n't understand , they help him understand , those that do not understand...that 's what I can call it <EOS>
Thank you <EOS>
