My name is Clémence Uwamahoro . I was born in Kibuye in a district , which was called Mabaza in sector called Rubengera , in Kibagiro cell . I am 21 years old . Well about the testimony of my life before the war , I was with my parents , my relatives , and my family at large . Then time came for me to start studying . The war started while I was in primary four and from then , we started having hardships in our studies . We would be asked about our ethics , they would come and say , "@ Tutsis stand there and Hutus stand here . @" But on my side , I never knew any thing . I remember sometimes they would ask me and I would tell them that , "@ my family belongs to Abanyiginya ... @" [ a clan ] I could n't understand what they meant . But my teacher knew my dad , so he would go and ask my father and then he would know it from there . Otherwise , all the time he asked me , I never used to reply him a single word . Because in my home , they never used to brief us about where to stand in case they asked for Tutsi or Hutus to stand @-@ up . Therefore , things continued like that and it never took long , I shifted from the first class to the second class to the third up the fourth . I remember it was in the first term in April . I remember one time when Habyarimana had died ; he died on the 6th of April 1994 . But on the 7th that is when I knew that he was died yet others knew it earlier . We were seated outside the house with several other people who were wondering about the president 's death . And after some time , we saw across in Mushubati and other areas , houses burning . We were many people seated outside . And , immediately we saw a very big group of attackers coming from Bandamiko they were the Bakiga , who lived just across . They were with a certain man who was called Fayineto ; he was our neighbour . He was introducing them the areas , which were mainly occopied by Tutsis . They passed in the midst of our group and said , "@ there is a big number of Tutsis living in this area ! It is only the Tutsis covering this hill . Therefore , once you are done with those areas in the valley , you will come and do a good job here . @" <EOS>
Then they said , "@ it must be the Tutsis who killed our president . Therefore , they must n't live . @" Then the former burgomaster of Mabana district ; Mr. Bagirishema Ignace came . He was moving in a car speaking loudly using a microphone , he was saying that , "@ all Tutsis wherever they are should come up at the district 's offices in oder for them to ensure all the Tutsi 's security at once . @" Because they had started burning from all sides except our home village . However they would begin from the valley and come up to the hill slowly by slowly . They had burned all those ends of Mushubati , Gihara sector , and they were proceeding towards Rubengera . Therefore , after realising that houses were being burnt , yet someone was anouncing that all Tutsis should seek refugee at the district 's offices where they would offer security services to all of them . We all went to the district ; my father , my mother and families all of us we left for the district . When we reached there , there were many people , it was on the 7th of April . Morning come , which was on the 8th of April 1994 but people continued coming in big numbers . Then Bagirishema the burgomaster went on and said , "@ since several people are still coming , yet the Bakiga are coming from up there with a plan of killing you from here . I guess the best idea is to carry your properties and babies , and help those who can not walk , up to the stadium . Since it is a big place and well fenced , it will be easy to protect you as required . @" Truly at the district it was not secure because it was an open place with people coming in big numbers , others were on the road ; some would come with all their belongings ... So he said that we had to go to the stadium where we would all be protected . Geneerally it was the safer place where no one would attack us and be able to do any harm to us . <EOS>
As soon as he had finished saying so ... people were still coming in big numbers and others were leaving . We were seven children and home ; two girls and five boys . I was the fourth born , the first three were boys . So one of them said ... he was called Epa ... Epaphrodite Dushimimena . He was a bit old ; he was in senior four [ secondary ] . He said ... but dad had told us that , we should all go to Kibuye because there was no other alternative . @" Then Epa said , "@ I will n't go to Kibuye to wait for death like a dog , follow all these people ... I have to go back home and rather die there than taking a journey to Kibuye . @" So , he refused going and went back home . Then my other brother called Aimable with Pacific whom I followed , they followed him and they were taken to ... there was a certain man who was a family friend . He was related to the burgomaster and they were living in the same gate . That is where they were taken . Then my sister and I , we were taken to ... there also another lady , to whom my mum was a godmother . At times we would live together . We were taken to her home and we stayed there . the remaining two who were the youngest , stayed with mum and went to the stadium with her . <EOS>
After we left , they also left and when they got there we were informed . The other one went back to the abandoned home ; it was already demolished though they had n't burnt it . We stayed there and we did n't what had happened . We thought that those who went to Kibuye are going to be protected and after some time , we would join up again . Because they had sent us in a home that was well off ; ‘ people who were related to the burgomaster ! ’ we thought we were really safe . <EOS>
So , we stayed there on the 8th/04/1994 . And , in the evening uncle Gasasira brought all the cows , which were at home in that home where we were . Then he went back . But before he left , he told us that , "@ several people are still coming in Kibuye but they are all worried because there is a rumor that they are going to kill them . There is a possibility that we will never see each other again . @" Be said bye to us and left . We stayed there and suddenly there came a group of attackers saying [ they were singing ] ; we have wiped away all the people who were in the stadium in Kibuye . They are all finished . Maybe those who remained in their home areas are the ones who have survived and we have to search for them seriously . We shall use dogs to hunt them so that no one stays behind . @" Apparently those who went to Kibuye were the old people and they had killed all of them . They had set roadblocks on every entrance and exit of the stadium . No one was able to get out ; whoever would need to pass they would hack him or her . After hearing that ... since I was the eldest to my sister whom we were together , I realized things had worsened . Then I wondered , " since they have killed them , where are we left ? @" <EOS>
Then , the owner of the home where we were living . After hearing that he said , "@ all in all they will come back for you @" his name was Munyagishari . He continued , "@ Among the people who are most wanted in Rubengera , there are three men . Those three must die ; "@ Gahizi is among them . @" my father , he was called Gahizi Evariste . Then he went on mentioning the names ; "@ Karungu is one of them and Leonard . @" Leonard was my father 's colleague ; they were teachers in Mushubati . "@ Whatever it takes , they must die . They will even come to kill you in my eyes . @" He told us . We could n't understand what he was taking about . Therefore , we sat outside with other kids . When we had that all those who went to Kibuye were killed , we knew that we are the next to be killed . And , whenever we would try to enter in the house , that man would tell us that , "@ remain outside because they will come to check in the house . And in case they found you inside they would kill me not leaving you , and demolish my house . Therefore , keep on playing with other kids outside they will n't know you . @" And then certain group of attackers went to Karungu 's home . Karungu had also refused to leave his home so he remained there in Ndara where he lived just across a place called Gacaca . And when that group past , there was some lady called Seseko , who knew our family . Then she said , "@ the man who lived here was a good friend to Gahizi . He used to look after his children and now I guess his children are in his home . @" As soon as she had said so , they past where we were seated with other kids . Then she said , "@ this kid resembles the mother so much ; she ressembles Dativa . @" Then she came close to me and said , "@ show me your hands ... smile for me ... @" she said that Tutsis have a dark gum , long fingers , their ribs have a special shape ... the she asked me , "@ you must be Gahizi 's child , do you disagree ? I just kept quiet . "@ Look the way she is proud ... anyway , let 's go to work first ... @" it was a very big attack of about thirty people . I only knew Seseko plus a another man who was called Byiringiro ; he lived in Kigabiro . Those are the people who seemed to be so active and they were the leaders of the whole group . Then they said that , "@ let 's go , we shall work on you when we come back . @" Therefore , they continued their journey towards Karungu 's home as we stayed there . <EOS>
Therefore , when Munyagishari heard that , they would come back and destroy his house just because of gahizi 's children [ us ] , whom is keeping , he told us that , "@ find a way of leaving this place and go somewhere else . Look your father is dead , your mother is dead too , your brothers none is alive ... @" It was around the 10th of Apri 1994 . Then we left his home after telling us those words . I told my young sister that , "@ let us just take the road and go because there is no where else we can hide . @" Where could we hide ? "@ dad I dead , mum is dead , no one is alive . Are we going to stay with this people ? can we live with them ? @" in my whole life , it was my first time to feel a lot of pain within me . I never knew how to cry neither did I know malice . Generally , I never knew ‘ suffer ’ I just got confused . <EOS>
So , we took our way towards Kibuye , hoping that maybe we would meet the killers so that they kill us too . When we reached at the road , we met the burgomaster Bagirishema . He was driving and inside the car , there were out two brothers . When we saw them ... [ The car just passed us ] we tried to stop them but the car proceeded towards Kibuye . We already knew that all people who went to Kibuye were dead , so we stayed wondering , " he knows that people in Kibuye died , so where is he taking them ? @" that is how they were taken ; the car continued and disappeared while we were watching helplessly . He drove to the stadium and we stayed there but we just watched him taking them . Then we said , "@ Epa must have died yet he was our elder brother . There is no way he may have survived yet the whole place was burnt . Mum and dad with others went to Kibuye . they are all died . Now they have taken Aimable and Ibi . We are left only the two of us . @" we did n't know what to do . When we reached in that man 's home we rested . And , after some time ... about two days later without anybody coming to search . They were going around killing here and there . Then , there came a certain man in that group of attackers but I never knew him before . He said , "@ we are informed that there Gahizi 's cows here and his two children . We must kill them and if not , we shall take the cows and eat them . @" then he replied them , "@ these kids are not Gahizi 's . They are my in @-@ law daughters . [ The kids of the brother of my wife ] . @" Then they said , "@ it that is true ... ? Well if it is true that they are your in @-@ law daughters , it means that they are children of your wife 's brother . Then your wife too must die . @" <EOS>
They went on , "@ They have something in common and it shows . Look at them ! There is no way you can lie that they belong to you . And , if they belong to your wife 's brother , it means that your wife is a Tutsi though we thought she was a Hutu . Therefore , she must die together with them . Because there is no Tutsi entitled to survive from this land . Then that man imagined and said , "@ impossible ! You can not kill my wife . It is impossible , how can you kill my wife ? She is not a Tutsi . Maybe it is just something that occurred in a family where she is related to the father of these kids . @" Then they called his wife and asked her , "@ how are you related to these kids ? @" She said , "@ they are my nieces . @" Then they angrily left . While leaving they said , "@ we shall come back for you . @" As they had just left ... meanwhile , that man told them that , "@ at least take the cows and maybe if you are to come back , we should talk about other thinks but do n't kill the kids or my wife . I will tell you the truth . @" Then , in a small distance , there were other attackers in the coffee plantation . Therefore , they came at once and took the cows . One of the cows was very aggressive yet it was the fattest of all . So , as they would try to take it out , it would act violently trying to kill them . So it ran and how they killed it , one would hack at the neck and another on would cut the tail , till when some of them aimed from in front of it and hacked it 's cloven hoof . Then the cow could n't move anymore ; it fell down . And after it fell down , how they slaughtered it ... it horrible ; one would cut the leg and go . And , the other one would take off the head and go , another one would take the other leg , until when the skin was left on the floor . <EOS>
When I saw all that , I said to myself , "@ this is how I will die . After killing this cow , I am the one who is left . @" After taking the cow , they said that , they should n't find us in that home when they come back . They had taken one cow out of the five that were there . "@ if we find then here , we shall slaughter them in your presence . @" They warned him . my sister told me that , "@ look at how we are going to die ! @" so we left ... he told us [ the man were we were living ] "@ please help me and leave this place . Look for somewhere else to go because I do n't wish to ... you have seen how they have killed that cow . Definitely that is how they will kill you . So please I do n't want you to die from here . They would rather kill you from where I can not see you than in my presence . @" <EOS>
Therefore we left very sure that we were going to Kibuye . We were ready to go to the stadium walking . Saying that if we met some perpetrator , then he would kill us and end the story like it happened to others ; we had forgotten about their stories , we had that they died and it was over . We were left no where . So we went through some place called Gacaca ... in Gacaca . There was a short cut to the main road . Then we saw a group of attackers who were coming from ... they coming saying that , "@ even those who had remained we have completed them . @" one would say , "@ I have killed the family of so and so . I looked for them and killed them because they are the ones I never liked most . We never used to talk and heart was never happy with them . @" <EOS>
Then another one said the same story . And then another man said , "@ in Gahizi 's family though I never saw many of the members ; I did n't see Gahizi . But the wife died . That is the only family I killed . @" he was imitating how he hit them using a club , saying how he was cutting them with knives . "@ But I did n't see all their kids . @" he added . When I had him saying that , I told my sister that , "@ I do n't know your idea but I suggest we sit here so that they find us and kill us from here . Hope you can here that they are very many and there is nothing left . We are not even left anywhere . @" Across the road there was a sorghum plantation , we were still in the shortcut almost getting to the main road . As soon as I heard them saying those words , heart charged ... I can not explain how I felt . It was beyond my understanding . Then I said , "@ I am going to sit here . Let them kill me from here , I will n't walk anymore . They should find me here and kill me . @" It was around 1:00 ... "@ I can not continue walking , how can one land in a group of such people ? @" I would imagine them killing us like they killed the other cow ; cutting a finger , a leg ... I said , "@ I will not move further . @" Then I sat down . I sat in the sorghum plantation next to the road . Then I laid down , "@ if they find me lying then may mistake me to be a corpse . @" I imagined . I decided that it was better to lie on road maybe one would hit me accidentally and then I would rest . Because I would imagine living alone in this world and I would find it very hard to understand . I got confused with a lot of sorrows . Then my sister told me that , "@ let me tell you ... @" she was called Dudu as nickname but her true name is Uwumukiza Grace . She said , "@ listen , Clemence . If you decided to stay here , I will not stay here with you . @" She is so brave . She told me that , "@ I have accepted dead , I will meet them and proceed to the stadium . Perhaps I would meet there at least one person from home then we would continue together . But you with your cowardliness ... I can not stay with you because I can not die seated just watching . <EOS>
So , I sat and imagined , "@ well , I am incapable of landing in a group of those people . @" I was tall and slim . My sister was fat and short . And , wherever I would pass they would shout at me saying , "@ look at that snake ... @" all kids we would met they would say the same thing . But my sister they would n't recognize her . Therefore I asked her , "@ did you hear what those kids said ? They said that , [ look at that snake , where is it heading at this time ? And now you are telling me that we go and meet those people , how do you think they are going to kill us ? And in case they killed me first , how will you handle it ? Definitely you will dye of sorrows . I will stay here . @" It was in the sorghum plantation . Then I decided to lay in the way so that they come and step on me or hit me at once rather than being killed with torture . Therefore , I came down the hill and laid in the way . Then she said , "@ bye ... I can not dye just seated here . @" Immediately she left . That was the last time I saw her , [ it was around the 12th April in 1994 ... until towards the end of September , that is when I saw her again ] She just left me and said that she could not sit and wait for her death . <EOS>
I laid in the road . I guess there is a way that one dies due to fear , to the extent of not feeling anything though being hurt to death . Because you are already dead . Therefore , I laid down and I was taken by sleep . By the time I woke @-@ up it was about 6:00 p.m. in the dark . I looked around and found out that I was in the sorghum plantation on the road . "@ how is it possible ! @" I wondered . I looked around but I could n't see Doudou . "@ This is my death . @" I looked at the place where I was and compared it with the life I led before ... I sat there till around 6:30 p.m. it was in dark . I started imagining my childhood life , my school life , and how far I had reached . Eh ! My father , My mother , my brothers and my young sisters , all I have lost them . I imagined all that and got confused . I started searching my family members but all of them were killed . I was left alone . So I could n't understand it . Then I woke up and asked myself , "@ what can I do ? @" I thought about going to the stadium but it was impossible , then I thought bout going back to the other family where they had chased me but still it seemed impossible . Then I said , "@ I wish dogs would come and eat me , because I would die and there would be nothing much left to worry about . @" I failed to find a decision . Later I decided to follow some small route that was in the sorghum plantation . I was hoping that I would attackers , who would be looking for survivors to kill them so , they would kill me . I decided to keep walking aimlessly , wherever night would find me , I would sleep there . I did n't want to hide myself anymore . <EOS>
Then I stood up and started moving . I walk a distance of about a kilometer ; I would walk though ways where I would meet people hunting others . Because I wanted to die . I did n't want to people to ever see me in exile . While I was still moving , I met a certain man called Alexis . He was teaching me in place of my mother because ; my mum had injured her leg . Therefore , he replaced my mum . So when we met I told him that , "@ please help me and kill me . @" I pleaded . Then he said that , "@ how can I kill you ? I killed too many people and I will kill more but I can not kill Dative 's child . @" But I insisted , "@ please kill me . My mum and dad are dead ; all my three brothers are dead , and my young sister desperately went to attackers now they killed her . I am the only one left and I am left nowhere . So please , if you like me , do me a favor and kill me . @" We had met from somewhere in the sorghum plantation . And he was holding a glittering knife , which was dropping blood . It seemed like he was coming from killing someone . But I kept on asking him to kill me in fact we fought for the knife . I begged him ; "@ I am left no where , please kill me . This is the worst death . The best you can do for me is to kill me . @" Then he said , "@ sincerely Bebe ! I like you and I used to like your parents . But I can not kill you though I killed so many people , and I am still killing others . The people I have killed are uncountable and I will kill other more . But I can not kill you because I can be accused of your blood . I knelt down and begged him again ; "@ you would be of much help to me if you killed me . Please I am begging you . There is nothing I can offer but God would reward you for that . @" He looked at me and said , "@ no ! I would never commit such a sin . @" "@ But you already committed it , because you killed others . But now I am begging you to do it for me . @" I said to him . then he said that instead of killing you , "@ let me show you . @" But I told him that , "@ wherever you may take me , it would be the worst death for me . The best you can do for me is to do something that would end my story . Because surviving alone in this world ... look I will never stay there where you are going to take me . @" <EOS>
He took me to his home . They were living in Gacaca and when his mother saw me , she shouted and said , "@ look at the other snake ! Where are you taking such people ? Just do me a favor and take her out of here ; I do n't want her here ... I do n't want her ... not at all . @" Their home was situated just above the road and then , a group of attackers was coming from the other side [ below ] of the road . Then she said , "@ let me call them . They will kill her and she will be a gone story . I can not let my house accommodate such a snake . @" Then he held his knife on his mother and asked her , "@ mother , you know that you produced me , is n't it ? I am your first born . But as I killed so many people , I will kill several others . And you can be among them . Watch this kid as you watch yourself . The day I will hear that she died , that is when you will follow her . @" The old lady said , "@ you rather kill me but I can not live in the same house with a snake . Impossible ... how can a person live with a snake ? @" the old lady rolled herself down . The son warned her , "@ I will kill you ! I will kill you myself . @" "@ You rather kill me but it is impossible . @" Immediately she rushed to the door and shouted for help , "@ help me ... help me . I am attacked by snakes . @" As the neighbors were still preparing to intervene , the son grabbed her and held her mouth and then pushed her under the bed . "@ Can you hear me ? I said I will kill you . @" He told the mother but she refused , "@ maybe you kill me but it is impossible . Do you want the Interahanwe to come and demolish my house and kill her and then kill me later ? Will it help you to remain alone in this world ? @" then the son told her that , "@ those are totally different stories . You are talking about me staying alone ? Besides giving bath to me , there is no other relationship that is between you and me . I am just warning you about that kid , and if you make any other noise ... @" he went on , "@ anyway , I will cut off your arm , then your leg ... you will die in slowly when you can not even call them anymore . @" Immediately he removed his knife from it 's pocket and held her like this ... he was going to cut her leg then she screamed , "@ please forgive me ! @" <EOS>
The attackers were still looking for that person [ me ] , but they did n't find anyone . Therefore , they proceeded . In was the same night and they never used to search a lot at night . Therefore , in the morning , Alexis had of course left for work . When he came back he told his sister who was called Therese ; she never used to go out of the house because she looked like the Tutsi . She was tall and slim and wherever she would pass they would attempt killing her . They would let her go after mentioning her brother because he was known as a colleague whom they worked together . So she would come home after they released her . Then the brother told her , "@ Therese , you have to stay with this kid . She should never fail to get water for bathing or food to eat . You should be together wherever you may be . @" Her sister agreed . She took me to the bedroom , washed me , and gave me food to eat . Then I slept . At around 11:00 o'clock , the other old woman came [ the one whom we first lived together ] she coming looking for us from every where because she was told that , "@ Gahizi 's children died from some place . @" She heard it from the people who passed us from where we were seated . They imagined we later died . Therefore , those people went straight to that old lady [ the mother to Munyagishali ] and told her that , "@ the other kids who were here , must have died . Because we saw them while we were passing by and in a few minutes we saw one lying down and the other one disappeared . Maybe she died somewhere else . @" <EOS>
They directed her very well and so , she came in the other sorghum plantation . She came looking just ahead of the road , where we were sitting but she did n't find us there . Then she started asking people around , "@ did you hear some two kids screaming while they were killed or you did n't ? Then someone told her that , "@ Alexis took her , we saw her in his home . But the other one we saw her going towards the attackers who were coming from the stadium . So , we do n't know what followed next . @" then she came at Alexis ' home because knew each other . She asked and Alexis ' sister said that I was there . Then she said that , "@ she is mine , she was given to me . Unless things change , otherwise the situation had improved . @" But in reality things had just started , it was in the initial phase of killings . Therefore , we went back together . But I had separated with my sister and we had never seen each other again . <EOS>
Then they took the cow outside , hacking it . They never used slaughter cows , they would kill it in a way that would let you think that ; if they got you , they would kill you more painful than a cow . If someone can kill a cow like that ; "@ hacking off the neck and another one cutting off the tail or any other part that appears close to him ! @" Then one would imagine , "@ what about me as a human being and yet the target ? @" One would imagine how she or he is going to die , and then she @/@ he would get confused . After they took the cow ... it was mooing all the way . I constantly heard it up to the time it disappeared completely . It mooed in pain ; they would hack it like this ... they would just hack . They would n't lay it down for slaughter and remove the skin first , never ! They would only hack anywhere no matter which part it was . If one hacked at the head , then he would take it like that while it was dripping blood . If another one hacked off the leg , then he would take it like that with its skin on . In order to make it lay down , they would hack its hoof joints ; they would hack one by one until when it could n't move any further and then fall down . So , they took that cow and told him , " we are still not convinced . We shall come back so that you explain to us the history . Because if you agreed to keep Gahizi 's kids , there must be another connection between you and him . Of course your connection can not be based on nothing . @" But the old man denied , "@ there is no relationship at all . The kids who were here left , and they were here as kids of the neighborhood . @" Then they said , "@ wait , we shall come back and talk about it and the day we will find anything here , you will be in trouble . We shall demolish your house and kill you with your wife . Because apparently it is explanatory that you are supporting them . @" <EOS>
Then the man told me that , "@ young girl , get out of my house . When he told me like that ... it was about the 20th ... Then I said , "@ fine . @" <EOS>
The 20th of April ... ? <EOS>
Yes. 20th of April 1994 . That time things were hot even in May . "@ Get out of my house and find somewhere else to go . Somewhere very far from here . Never think about coming back here . @" <EOS>
A certain man held me by the hand and said , " come here , you must die like others . @" there was a way they used to shout when they saw a person . And then all of a sudden I had people shouting . When I reached at the road , I realized that it was n't me instead , it was another man who was called Rukemasibe . He was a teacher and they had revealed him . "@ we have found Rukemasire . @" They said . The kids they were together , some were hacked but they were still dying ; they had n't died completely and they were taken on a wheelbarrow to a certain pit hole to be dumped . There was a certain pit hole in Gacaca just behind the commune 's offices . And , all the people who would be hacked but not dead , they would carry them on a wheelbarrow and dump them in that pit . But there was a trench of water and it was during a rainy season . Therefore , water would run through that trench to the pit hole . Then I told that man , "@ please kill me , but kill me at once because I do n't want to be like those . Look at how they are ! They are going to be dumped in the hole while they are still alive ... @" some never had legs , others were seeing ... machetes , others were bleeding . They would be carried on a wheelbarrow because all their joints were not functioning and they would be dumped in the pit hole . Then he asked me , "@ have many brothers did you have ? @" I replied him that , "@ I had five brothers but they are all dead . @" "@ What if I save you ? @" he asked me . Then I told him that , "@ that is not the solution . I believe that , the answer to the problems I have now is death . Therefore , just kill me . My younger sister was killed too , I am the only one still existing . @" He was a Mukiga man ; he did n't even know my home village yet all the people who lived in our home village knew us very well . <EOS>
"@ What was the name of your father ? @" he asked me . He mentioned names of people and mentioned Gahizi and Karungu . He said , "@ there is one called Gahizi , and another one called Karungu and another one called Leonard ... they were teachers . Is he among those ? @" I said , "@ yes , it was Gahizi and he died but I am begging you to kill me please . @" Then he asked me , "@ there must be a reason why you survived while the rest of your family members died . How do you expect me to kill you ? Me too I will n't kill you , go and die in the hands of someone else . @" He threw me like that . Then the other killers came . Then one of them asked , "@ what about this one ? Why are you tossing her from one person to another ? @" after asking why they were not doing something with me , one of them explained to him , "@ this kid her whole family is dead and no one can tell about her past . All her family died ; both her parents died , all her family members were killed from the stadium , and her brothers were all killed . She is the only one who has remained . Can one kill such a person ? There must be a reason why she does n't die , who knows ? Better leave her . @" Then that man said , "@ to hell ! If you have failed to kill her , me too I will n't kill her . @" They left me there . And then I went back to the other home . Those perpetrators were all from the tribe called Bakiga and they wondered why I was going to that home . "@ Maybe those cows in that home belong to her family ! @" they were guessing . And then added , "@ let us go and ask that man to give us a cow in order to leave him with the kid . @" They came and took another cow but it was still the same way ; one would hack and the other one would take another part till when the cow is finished . Sometimes they would leave part of the cow on the ground and go . <EOS>
Then I asked the old man in that home , " since the cows are over , what will you give out next time they come ? It should be me . @" Then he said , "@ definitely that is why I told you that I do n't want to see you here anymore . @" "@ so , what can do ? @" I asked him . Then I got out of the house and said , "@ well , I have to leave ... @" I decided to start moving in open . I did n't care about who I would meet and what he would do to me . All I was avoiding was staying in that home . I saw how he would bribe them with a cow every time they came to his home , till when all the cows were finished . There had remained two cows , now the two cows were also taken . Therefore , since the cows are finished ... definitely he would not accept to remain with nothing . He also used to move ; I could not see him at home , he would come back in the evening . Ever , he would go and come back in the evening . I would say , "@ they will kill me next . @" but I would imagine how they killed the cows ... in fact that is the only reason why I never wanted to stay there . I would imagine it is would be same way they would kill me . <EOS>
I told him that , "@ now I have left . @" Then he asked me that , "@ please go and never think about coming this way . Hope you can see that next time they will demolish my house . @" I told him that , "@ do n't worry , I am going . @" Again I sloped down . But some times I wonder , I think that is God works ; I always say that if the sorghum plantations were not there , no one would have survived among those who survived in Rubengera . <EOS>
I left that home . I lived in the sorghum plantation for days . At night I would go and drink some water and then come back and sit some where in the sorghum plantation . I would see everyone passing , the attacker , although I would notice them . They used to be mixed up with the Bakiga from up there . I would see Seseko ... that lady who was called Seseko was the common figure , maybe it was because she was the one I knew before . I also knew Dushimimana , they passed by ... night would fall . I would sit and watch . They came up with a new system of hunting people with dogs , after realizing that people no longer live in the house . They would send dogs in the sorghum . Truly , most people survived from the sorghum plantation . Lets say one would walk a bit trying to change a position or when one is tired of either sitting or sleeping . Then we would separate the sorghum plants slowly and we would move without shaking . Because it was in the valley , they would stand on top of the hill and see shaking sorghum plants . Immediately they would send dogs and blow whistles . And , maybe it would show signs of raining . Whenever it would rain . I would fell relieved , because I used to know that no one would hunt me from the sorghum plantation , while it was raining . Maybe they will go to homes but no one can allow to be beaten by rain just looking for me . Suddenly , I heard ... I was trying to shift from where I was , because it was very close to the road yet groups of attackers were still coming from the stadium . Therefore I decided to extend upwards because I was afraid of dying while I was watching . I said to myself , "@ I better expend a bit and in case they run after me , they will find when I already fainted . @" So I changed the place and went a bit up . Suddenly , I heard whistles . "@ There is somebody there . Check in all sides in the middle of the plantation . The plants are moving , there must be people . @" <EOS>
Then dogs took off . They all came down the hill and they were every where . Then I said , "@ they rather bite me but will n't catch any . @" I sat down . They were about twenty dogs ; they would come while barking wearing bells in their necks . Then they had reached close to where I was one of the killers communicated to the dogs to come back and go the other side , where they had seen other people . Therefore , all the dogs went there . When the dogs ran , that is was when I heard how happy they were , saying that they have found someone . Then I prayed , "@ God , why did n't you make them come here ? @" I saw how they were killing people and I would wonder . I never imagined the kind of death I would die . I got confused . Then I was them coming up with a certain man , who lived there in Gacca with his wife . He was called Boniface , he was taken to Mugano ‘ Bamboo ’ [ a place that was named after the common plant in the area ] ; a place which is at the road that goes to Kibuye , just below the commune 's office at a place where , there used to be a football court . There used to be bamboo just near the market . I saw that it was Boniface with his wife that they were taking . They took them to the bamboo and there was a roadblock . They said , "@ we could n't find this man during the time of traitors . Now what kind of death should he die ? @" I was watching every step in a distance . But I would n't believe it ; those acts were beyond my imagination . They used to have spears though they never used them to kill people . They would use sharpened bamboo ; they would sharpen it till when it appears like a spear yet it was a stick . They would display them on a line as if they were on sell . Everyone who would pass there , yet he or she was among a group of attackers . He would take one as he wished . <EOS>
So , they took that man and ... they said to him , "@ we looked for you all the time but you were no where to be seen . Yet we know you corroborate with Inyenzi . You are going to tell us every thing plus their [ Inyenzi ] plans . @" Then he told them that , "@ do as you wish ... @" he was a quiet man . he told them that , they should do as they want ; "@ if you want to kill me with my wife kill us , and if you do n't want to kill us , them leave us . @" a certain man was holding that sharpened stick and struck it to him in the ribs . Another person pushed it deep into him and it appeared from the other side . Then he pulled it out and the intestines came out . His wife immediately fell down and they did the same thing to her . After piercing her , they pulled out the stick and her intestines came out too . Then , he [ killer ] reached for her intestines and pulled them so hard while the lady was lying down . I would see it from a distance . He pulled the lady 's intestines and tied them with the husband 's intestines ; you could see that he was struggling to tie them together because he would shake almost falling down . Then he tied their intestines together and then one of them told his fellow who was tying them , "@ after tying them , make them stand up and ask them to stop us as the used to do . @" That is how he told the fellow . I was watching them ; I was in a bout five meters distance but I was in the sorghum plantation . Therefore , the man replied that , "@ we can not stand , it is impossible . @" They were lying down . Then the perpetrator said , "@ okay stop us again from moving . This is our government and we shall do what we wish to do or want . So , show us that you can stop us now . @" <EOS>
They finally died while still tied together . How I saw it ... they were lying down in the road with their intestines tied together ; they were dying . Then I saw another group of attackers coming from the stadium and I said , "@ how am I going to die ? @" I could n't imagine how . Then I decided to go back to the other family in Gacaca in the other man 's home . But I would imagine going back there yet all cows were finished , I knew he would handle me to the perpetrators . He wanted some profits out of those cows . Because he looked after them and cared about them all the time . Then I said , "@ if I go back , he will handle me to the perpetrators . Then they would kill me in the same way . @" Days had gone ; it was about mid May . I took sometime imagining how I would go back to that home but finally I decided to go back in the sorghum and sit . It was in some trench and they had lied grass [ vetiveri ] on top of the trench . Therefore , I sat in there up to night . I spent almost three days in there . It was very silent because those days it would rain a lot yet they would n't go out for people while it was raining . Therefore , after those three days I stood up and walked in the sorghum plantation again . <EOS>
What time was it ? <EOS>
It was around 3:30 ... I lost my understanding when I fell down . And in the evening ... yes it was in the evening because it was dark , that is when I gained consciousness . I did n't know where I was ; I felt like I was coming from very far and I would n't imagine what had happened to me . Then later I started recalling what had happened , all that had happened to Boniface ; how he was killed . I began wondering if I was dreaming or if it was real . I spent a long time thinking about it . And a round 11:00 p.m. in the night ... but they were still blowing the whistles ; they would retrieve someone just next to me , then retrieve others the other side . I would hear others shouting only once and for all . <EOS>
Then I said ... I would imagine how I would die ... I would thing of anything I would use to commit suicide and I would see that it would n't kill me . I would think but find no solution . I did n't know what to do . I remained seated all night through , until when there was nothing moving anymore . Morning found me in the sorghum plantation alone . But I was affected by only one thing , ‘ thinking too much . ’ Then I would recall the memories of the place where my brothers passed . Then I said , "@ I should sit up and try to see that place . @" Then I would compare my passed life with the life I was leading . I was only remaining with death . <EOS>
I went to the road and sat there . While I was sitting there , I the burgomaster passing again . On his pick @-@ up behind , there were people saying that , "@ we have finished all the Tutsi , they are all dead . The rest you should work hard rewards are awaiting . @" <EOS>
I saw a certain policeman in that car , who reminded me of that time of searching for traitors ; During that time of searching for traitors , the burgomaster was searching in our home area . He came to my home by himself yet it was the policemen who were supposed to do that . But he said that , "@ I ... @" he went to my grandmother [ my dad 's mother ] ; her two kids were living in Kigali . Therefore , the burgomaster said that , "@ there is no way this old lady would be ... @" she was a very old grandma , she could n't walk . So he said , "@ there is no way this old lady would be having children living in Kigali , and have no gun in her house . I will have to check her home myself . @" He entered in the house himself while the rest remained outside . His car was parked at home like this with many policemen around our home . The burgomaster said , "@ I have to search in this old woman 's house and Gahizi 's house by myself . Because you can not search them as I may wish . @" Therefore , he searched in the houses himself . He entered and ordered every body to get out except my grandma . "@ You will remove everything and I will check by myself . Because I am sure you have a gun . " He told my grandmother . Then she asked him , "@ my son , as I am can I have a gun ? As you see me ... which gun would it be or from where ? How would I hold it or use it for ? @" The burgomaster seemed to have enough respect and honor to enter the old lady 's house and go under the bed by him self . I was living with my grandma but he chased me out so badly and said , "@ I must remain with this old lady alone . @" Then he checked . We followed them when they left but he never found anything . Then they went to my home and when they reached there , still he entered and checked ; he through everything up and he was with one policeman to unveil things for him . They looked around the house in the gardens but they did n't find anything . Then after they got into their cars and left . Later they met my dad and told him that they found a gun in his house . They showed his a pistol they had . "@ We found a gun in your house . Get into the car . @" They commanded him . But my dad told them that , "@ you can kill me but I can not agree with you . Let 's go and you show me where you got it and how you got it . @" The burgomaster said , "@ I got it and it is here . Let 's go you have to be arrest and get out Rubengera . You must have been having a gun . It should be there . @" <EOS>
Then my dad told him that , " that is very impossible . I will n't get into your car . @" The burgomaster insisted , "@ you will enter it unwillingly . @" But dad refused ; "@ I can not get into that car . @" Then he started working towards home and then the burgomaster said to him that , "@ though we did n't find it ... though I am telling you that it is here yet it is not the one but you should be aware that you will never stay here . You have to join others . @" dad ignored him and continued to go . I recalled all that after I saw that policeman who was with the burgomaster when they were checking at home . In a moments time after the car had passed , I would see how they were catch people and killing them . On one would get a person and kill him ; let 's say hit him or at once with a club . They would cut off a foot first , then hit him or her with a club , and leave him or her still alive . They had clubs of this shape ... they used to call them ‘ Ntampongano y'umwanzi . ’ They were spiked clubs , with nails and if they hit it on the leg , there would remain holes on the leg . And , if they hit it in the head , it means that , the bone would be crashed and one would keep bleeding . But one would n't die , depending on which part they hit . Therefore , whenever I would see how they kill people , I would just tell that I would die a painful death and I would immediately move . I immediately stood up and started walking around in the sorghum plantation . That time I was not meeting people anymore instead I would meet dogs . Whenever they would see plants shaking they would send dogs . So I would faint and wake up the following day in the morning . And , I would neither tell where I was nor what had happened . That is how days would go by but if there were no sorghum plants , I wonder what would have happened . I guess none would have survived . From then , people stopped coming instead they would send dogs . Then I got so hungry but I did n't know what to do . There were no other crops rather than sorghum . Therefore , you would imagine eating grass , which was impossible . After all , thoughts about food would come to your mind only when you were resting , which was for a small time . Most of the time one would n't feel hunger or ... we could n't drink , that was out . <EOS>
Then I left and said to myself , "@ what if I go back to the other old man 's home ... maybe they stopped because I no longer see attackers moving . @" Therefore , I went there . But days had passed ; it was around early June and they had remained with two cows . I stayed in that home after two days and nights , in a certain morning ... very early around 6:30 a.m. it was slightly dark though there was some kind of light . Then I had a group of attackers knocking on the door . "@ Munyagishari , in your house there are Gahizi 's children . And since they are here , we can not do anything before we wipe them away . And , in the whole of Gacaca , you are the only one remaining with people , all others died . @" they told that man ; Munyagishali . They were talking while standing outside the door . So , he took me behind the house . They started checking in the main house yet I was in the small house behind the big one . Later they left . "@ We shall come back in dawn while we can see clearly . You will n't lay to us anything . We shall look for her and in case we do n't see her ... we know you still have their cows . They will also be taken . @" They said . <EOS>
Then he said , "@ the remaining cow is mine ; somebody gave it to me . You took all properties , which they had given me , now the remaining cow I will n't give it to you . @" They said , "@ do n't worry we shall discuss about it when we come back . Therefore , they left . It was in June and several days had passed . Though I never used to know days , I believed there had passed long time because it reached it July while we were still hiding . And personally I was still hiding in August . I would n't walk in open . While I was outside with other kids , I never entered in the house . He was telling that , "@ if you enter in my House , they will demolish it . Go and look for some where else to hide . @" Then I said , "@ should I go back and keep watching how they are hacking people with the spiked clubs ? I will stay here , where they would kill me rather than torturing me and live me alive . They shall kill me and finish up Gahizi 's family so , they will be sure that none is alive in Gahizi 's family . @" <EOS>
"@ Hey you @" he said to me , "@ find somewhere else to hide , I do n't want to see you in this house . @" "@ I will n't enter in your house , I keep outside with other kids @" I replied him . Therefore we sat and other kids told me that , "@ do you know that Doudou died ? @" I replied them that I know . Then they told me that they saw the place where dogs ate her from . "@ She was wearing a jumper that looks like this ... @" and one would say , "@ I saw her leg @" and the other one would say , "@ I saw her head ... but dogs already ate her . @" I told them that , "@ I know dogs ate her . And I am the only one surviving . @" Some lady called Toyota saw me and wondered , "@ you are still alive ! Where are you since all your people died ? You survived in order to live with the agony of your people . Let me take you where they would kill you very fast . @" I told her that I will n't go from where I was , "@ they should find me here . @" I said . Therefore , I stayed there with other kids on the roadside . They would talk and sing in whistles but me ... maybe it was because I was on the road expecting anybody to come at anytime and identify me out of others and kill me . One would come and say , "@ this kid must die though we do n't know her home . Because she does n't look like others . @" <EOS>
Therefore , I saw him coming and behind him there were about fifty people . then I wondered , "@ Pastor ! @" I went and greeted him though , he was looking at me so badly . As he was walking , he was carrying his small bag of bibles . He used to walk with that bag so , I saw him . "@ what is between pastor and this whole group of attackers behind him ? @" I was outside but I swiftly entered in the gate . " It is over now . I am going to die . @" I told Verediane , the girl whom we lived together in that home . "@ All I used to say was just what I thought , but now I am going to die . Can you imagine I have seen the pastor Kanani coming here ! He is coming here and behind him there is a big group of attackers . Do you think there are other people whom they have come to kill in this area ? @" I said to her . But she told me that , "@ just be strong . Although there is no one else here , the God that protected you all this time will protect you now . @" I said , "@ no , I do n't want to survive . In fact let me get outside but , since there is pastor they may not kill me because he knows me . @" Then she said to me , "@ you never know , he may be the worst of all . Just stay calm . @" But I said that I would n't hide myself . "@ I will in the open . @" <EOS>
Umh ! Suddenly I heard people knocking . The whole group of attackers came running behind the pastor . They had clubs , sharp sticks ... then I asked myself , "@ fifty people have come to kill only me . How will they kill me ? @" I could not understand it because I had seen how they killed several people in several ways depending on ‘ who was who . ’ ... some would be cut fingers , other would be cut feet . Then I would wonder , "@ all these people ... ! @" they seemed like a whole market . They were saying , "@ some kid from Gahizi survived and she is just in front there . @" "@ is that true ? @" I would ask myself but I would never understand it . "@ All these people for me as I am ... @" I would look at myself and could n't believe it . "@ all these people with pastor leading them ! @" I would not believe it . But I refused to enter in the house . I wanted them to kill me so that I would rest . "@ they should come and finish me , maybe you would get a chance to sleep . @" I told the girl . <EOS>
As I was sitting there , pastor Kanani came ; he was holding his bag . Then he told the old man , "@ we heard that in your home , there are Gahizi 's children who survived , now these people are on my case . They said they must kill them or take Gahizi 's cows , which remained here . @" <EOS>
The old man said , "@ I told you that there is no child here . Come in and see . @" But he imagined and said , "@ I do n't want them to demolish my house . Because , they will still kill the child after demolishing my house . After all , this has lasted for so long ; they took all the cows just because of the same kid . And , now they are still looking for her . In case I do n't give them the kid , they will demolish my house and if they demolish the house , even the kid will die . @" Therefore , he told them that , "@ come into the house if you get her , then you will take her . @" They all entered in the house . Fifty people in one house . Some climbed on top of the house others looked around in the sorghum and coffee plantations , they checked everywhere and said , "@ we must know the kid , who is here . We know there is one . @" They were informed by the kids we were together ... those kids went saying that , "@ one kid died , the one who is tall and slim and resembled her mother , is the remaining one . She is and the old man 's home . We have been together just now and then , she was called to go and eat but she is there . @" <EOS>
Pastor said , "@ she was with other kids out there in the past few minutes . I saw her ; she was just seated there with other kids and entered here while I was seeing . Bring her out and do quickly . @" I would be a bit afraid but on the other hand I would say , "@ yes let it be over maybe all the worries will be gone . I will never spend more days running or wandering in the sorghum plantations . I will never ... umh ... it will be over and that will be it . @" therefore , they all went out and sat at the slop waiting for me to get out ; the road was on slopping up to our home . Therefore , there was a steep slop so , they all went and sat there . ‘ It was similar to how Jesus went before Pilato . ’ I came out and saw the whole line . About fifty people sitting and me standing in front of them . <EOS>
The other feeling of joy for death , turned into a problem . I said to myself , "@ I alone ? @" I would n't believe it . I was so afraid and said , "@ will I survive this point of time ? @" I sat down . Then I told that woman ... [ She was normally called Mama Vincent . ] "@ Mama Vincent tell me , look at all those people . My dad and mom are already killed . Doudou and Epa all died . no one is remaining . @" However my uncle and aunt lived these ends in Kigali , but I never thought about them . I considered only those whom we were together , after all they were the majority but they had all died . In addition , no one had survived in Kigali . I told her everything . I told her ; "@ Imagine how they killed Boniface , I was watching ; they pierced him from the ribs and some things came out , then they tied them with the wife 's . And then after they [ perpetrators ] asked them to stand up and stop them from passing . Well , tell me how are they going to kill me ? I am alone but look at all those people @" I was so afraid and sat there . she came and pulled me and said , "@ stand here . @" Though I would n't believe it ... it was a problem to me . <EOS>
I stood in front of them , trembling and feeling weak due to fear . I would imagine how I was going to die ... killed by hundreds of people . I would look at myself and see how small I was and compare it with all those men carrying several weapons , then I would wonder , "@ how will I die ... ? How will I die ? @" I would imagine one taking out my eye and another one doing other weird thing to me ... then I would wish that , if it was possible ... I used to watch films and see how people who die being shot , die in a nice way . It is just a single shot and one dies straight away without a clue on what happened . Therefore , I would look around and wonder , "@ Is n't there someone with a gun to fire me with just a single bullet now ? @" I sat down because I had failed to stand due to fear ; I was shaking so hard and I would fall down . Therefore , two of them came and made me stand . One held here and the other one held here . Then they said to the old man , "@ Mr. Munyagishari , you have been telling us that there is no Gahizi 's child here . So , tell us the background of this kid . Tell us all about how you got her because we know that in your home there is no child who ... you have never had a child who looks like this in your home . @" <EOS>
Then he replied them that , "@ this child is my wife 's niece . @" "@ Who is your wife ... is your wife a Tutsi , a Hutu , who is your wife ? @" they asked him . Then he replied then that , "@ my wife is a Hutu . @" "@ So , if your wife is Hutu , how is she related to these children ? Look at how she looks like , see her height ... @" they asked him again . They would straighten my fingers and observe my nails . Then his wife said , "@ this is my cousin 's daughter and ... @" she was trying to show them that his cousin was a Tutsi but they never shared parents . <EOS>
And after she gave all the explanation they said , "@ it is impossible . You are wasting your time explaining . @" Suddenly a certain man came out of the crowd and said , "@ I know this child , she is Dative 's daughter . I know all her ancestors ; their origin is in Mushubati and they look unique . I know her , look at her ; in fact you should die with her . How could you be so brave to lie about things I am sure about ? @" <EOS>
Umh ! The old man got scared when he heard that person , who knew all my background from my mother 's side . Then he immediately told him that , "@ do as you wish . You though about it and you made a step to come here , God can witness of what I worked for ... @" but as he was talking , they were not listening . "@ do what you want . @" He told them . Then they said , "@ what should we do ? @" And pastor said , "@ if you want to remain with the kid , stay with her but give out the remaining cows to be eaten . @" "@ I can not give out the cows . The remaining cows ... I worked and I have been struggling all these months ... @" he replied them [ it was about two months ] "@ it has been almost two months looking after the kids and properties and now you want to take all things from me and I will be the looser . @" The old man added and he told them that it was impossible . Then pastor said quickly that , "@ well , so they should kill the kid but still , after killing the kid even the cows will never stay here . Of course some other people will come and say that Gahizi 's cows are still there . Yet they must die too by all means . So , you have to make your choice . @" The old man said , "@ okay , instead of killing the kid , take the cows . @" <EOS>
Therefore , they went and took out another cow . And kill it in the same way . Critically , their major concern was n't killing ; they were more interested in eating . So they took out the cow and killed it like they killed other cows ; cutting off horns , ears , until when it falls off . And then everyone would take what he managed to cut . They would cut they would piece with the skin on . And , one of the attackers , after others had left with the meat , he told the old man [ Mr. Munyagishari ] that , "@ let me give you some piece of advice , with this child , in the end all things that you have ... all their cows , everything will get finished . And the end will be her ; they will kill her . Find another way or let her go and be killed with other perpetrators . And after she dies , no one will come to you again because you have been giving out things as to bribe for her . @" <EOS>
Then the man said , "@ that is true . @" Immediately he threw me out of his house and said , "@ look for another place to hide , I do n't want to see you here . @" I said , "@ it is okay . @" After he told me that , immediately I left and stayed in the sorghum plants in a trench . It would rain but I would enter in the trench and whenever it would shine I would sit in the sorghum plantation . Dogs would come and I would faint because of fear and I would come back to my senses when they had left . I wonder why they never bit me . The war stopped before someone 's finger or any dog 's teeth neither touched me . I was alone . <EOS>
About two days later after that cow was eaten , that when the other old lady came to look for me . [ The wife to Munyagishari ] she was looking everywhere in there sorghum plantation because , I never used to go very far . Because if I walked very far , it would mean crossing roads . And if I crossed roads , I would have met people who knew me who would kill me so painfully . I continued walking and reached the other pit hole . I heard people talking from inside the pit . I asked myself , "@ should I get in ? @" I never peeped inside because it was across the road but on the roadside . I imagined that in case I peeped in it , I would also go inside it and I would die with suffer yet that is what I was avoiding . I went and sat in the sorghum plantation . In the evening ... it was already dark in the evening . I heard someone who was walking slowly and talking to herself . It was the other woman , she bumped into me and said to me , "@ listen , they have planned to come and kill you and demolish our house . So , I will take you somewhere very far from here since it is at night . You will stay there and luckily enough , they do n't know your family . @" [ It was near Gitesi in a different district ... near the stadium . ] And when the war chills a bit , you shall come back and we live together . Me too I said there was no problem with that . <EOS>
Therefore , we started our journey in that night at around 7:00 p.m. it was dark . We crossed and went to Gitesi . She was taking me to her eldest daughter who lived there . When we reached there she spent the night there and left the following morning . When I reached there , I surfed terribly . I even wished to go to the sorghum plantation but I could n't see it . She had old children whom we were of the same age . We were of the same age with her first born because we were both in primary four by then . She treated me like a maid in her home though in my whole life I did n't know such a thing . I used to shower , eat and sleep nothing much . <EOS>
I asked her , "@ digging ... ? Fetching water ... ? @" then she said that , "@ you will be fetching three Jeri cans of water . @" I told her that , "@ that is impossible . @" I would imagine how I never knew how to carry even a small Jeri can , and just conclude that it was the worst death I would ever experience . To me , it worst than the time I was alone without anybody . I would remember that even at home I never did such work . So I told her that , "@ I will never do that work . @" Then she bet , "@ you will do it . @" However the first days I did it ; she would wake me up in the morning while others were sleeping and take me to the stream to fetch water with a big Jeri can . I told her that I could n't manage the big Jeri can . So , she gave me a smaller one . I would keep fetching until when I fill three Jeri cans . And then after , we would go together in the garden to dig . She would dig as I am sitting , and later she would say , "@ I am fed up . You can not work anymore , so why am I keeping you ? @" those days she would n't give me food . She would let me eat only if I fetched water , allowed to go digging and look after . But it reached a point and I told her my mind . That time she had sent me at the stream and it had rained . Therefore I slipped and fell in a water channel . That is when I said , "@ this is the worst life ever . I am doing things I never did at home ; I never fetched water , I never woke up at this time . It is my first time this to happen to me . I have never dug before ; I never eat because I did this or that work . Though I fetched the water I was not allowed to shower on it . @" I had because like a slave ; I was like a servant who does n't have rights to work freely . <EOS>
I thought about it and then told her , "@ listen to me , " that is after I had left the stream . I told her that , "@ in my life as long as we still live together , I will never wake @-@ up to go for water or go digging again . You would rather chase me . @" Though I told her like that , I asked her to be letting me sleep in her house . "@ And if you refuse , I know I can not fail to get where to sleep . Even where I was I would sleep well . @" It hurt her so much and then she asked me , "@ is that what you have said ? You are in excess of all things ? @" Eh ... I would remember how I never eat , how every thing was a problem ; it was only stress and worries . I developed some kind of desire of committing suicide and I would ask myself , "@ how can one commit suicide ? @" then I would remember what I used to watch in movies , how one can use a knife to commit suicide or hung himself or herself to death . And then I would wonder , "@ where can one do it ? in fact , how can I start it or who can help me ? @" I would not understand it . Therefore , I died of sorrows . I would imagine all the work I do without any appreciation ... well , she would leave her food , but at least say ‘ thank you ’ or 'do n't worry ’ or say anything in a nice manner . She would tell me , "@ get out , where is the water ? How come things are not like this or that ... ? Why do I see some weeds there ... ? @" weeds ... ? I would n't understand her . "@ I told you that I will never do that again . If you want you can chase me out of your house but I will never go digging or doing this or that . @" I would tell her . She was mistreating me but hiding it from her husband . Whenever her husband would be around , she would be a good person and sometimes say , "@ hi Mahoro , how are you ? How do you feel ? @" I would be confused and ask myself , "@ but why ... ? @" another time she would be hash to me . Then I imagined that there must be a reason why sometimes she acts so nice to me and another time she ... I started things that I was the one with a problem . <EOS>
I thought it was me who would cause him to talk in a bad way . Then I asked her , "@ Beatrice , why do you talk to me so badly ? What did I do ? "@ It seems like you do things you do n't want to do forgetting that you depend on me . @" Immediately I told her that , "@ that has got nothing to do with it . @" I was open and told her , "@ you know my home , you know how things used to be . I had never held a Jeri can before or dug . But even though I did , you can teach me . Mean while talking to me well is enough . Not coming to me and begin ordering ; do this or that and when I finish you do n't give me something to eat . Well it is okay . @" I tolerated it in those days because some days she would talk to me well that was if her husband was around . Whenever we would go to dig together with her husband , she would say to me ; "@ Mahoro sit a bit and look after the baby . Do n't do anything else . @" But whenever the husband would be absent ... I do n't know what he used to do somewhere he would go and come back after a couple of days . She would time when the husband would be away and then torture me horribly . <EOS>
Then I told her that , "@ I will be fetching water one with a Jeri can . At whatever time vi will be coming back , that will be it . But I will be bringing a Jeri can of water here . About digging , at least you will be digging and I will be weeding . @" I had totally failed to learn dig ; I would aim higher but still the hoe would n't penetrate deeper . Therefore , she told me that , "@ I have agreed with you on that . @" when she realized that I was getting used , she asked me to be using a big Jeri can . Well that was okay with me ; taking a Jeri can only ... I would take it , but there was pipe in place where I used to fetch water . It was between gardens on a hill that one would see people digging . Though they never hurt me , they would look at me strangely . Then I would imagine , "@ these people may betray me ; they may go and tell the other killers that they saw a child who looked like this or that . @" I thought they would go and say to them , "@ it is our first time to see her in this area though she must be living around . However we do n't know where she lives . @" <EOS>
Therefore , I changed . I told her that , "@ I will never go to fetch water from there . Because people come and stare at me while others whisper some things to each other . They are capable of bringing people to kill me . I should not fetch water from there anymore , maybe I can fetch ... @" there was another source of water beyond the hill . I asked her to be getting water from there . I suggested that because I knew there was a sorghum plantation and that was where I used to live in peace . Therefore , I wanted to be living there and go back to her place to eat , that is if she wanted to give food to me . But when I live in the plantation in peace . She agreed and said , "@ truly they can kill you from there ... @" in her minds she thought we would always live together and I would keep working for her in her home . So , she accepted . I would take a Jeri can and whenever I would see people looking at me so much , I would look into the water . I would do that depending on the type of people who would be staring at me . For example , people who would come talking to each other in a funny way . "@ thy are going to kill me . @" I would think . But I would feel like ... I had started understanding that I must n't die . I had realized that death was not the solution . It was due to the fact that there were no more people dying . In that place there were not many people dying , maybe they had finished them . Therefore , I would sit and after they would pass I would sit and go through my past life ; how things happened , how people died and think about the future ; "@ what will the future be like ? @" <EOS>
Whenever I would hear some people coming I would face into the water and pretend like I was fetching water . Therefore , they would hear that somebody is fetching water . Until when a digging season reached and she would send to the garden for weeding . I would spend the whole day going through my agony ... I would think about that all the time and it would never finish . I felt like I should think about those events only . I never wanted to forget about it even a single moment . I would imagine how they died , how they rested , I would imagine how they bare no more problems and then imagine how I was going to suffer . I would try to see the life I was gong to lead but I would not get it . I would see a group of people coming like attackers ... that time they were not using dogs ; they were hunting people by themselves . They would go to suspects ' homes , to the sorghum plantations ; they would go there by themselves . It had reached tome of harvest and some sorghum was cut down . And it seemed very clear in the plantation . I knew I was going to die . I asked myself , "@ where will I go ? @" <EOS>
Therefore , I allowed to be going to the garden . But whenever they would come , I would bend in the ... I would remove the grass from the garden . And if they found me at the stream , I would bend in the water pretending to be busy fetching water . And after they would leave , I would also stop . And later I would go home . I would go home in the evening and whenever her husband would be at home , I would feel like am a child too ; we would chat and he would calm me , "@ you have to be strong , if your father and the rest of your family died . It is over and over so you have to be strong . We shall continue to live with you @" he would tell me . He was called Damien then I told hiim that , "@ it was impossible . @" I told him ; "@ how can we live together ? I can not manage waking up in the morning and go for water then go digging yet I do n't know how to dig . And in case I do n't do it , I do n't eat . And if I do it I will injure myself because I do n't know how to dig . @" <EOS>
Then the man asked me ; "@ do n't you eat ? @" "@ Me ? Never ! I eat rarely only after I did that work . I did n't dig to her desire , then I do n't eat . @" I replied him . I did n't feel like doing it . But I had started walking in the road and it seemed to be safe . I would not see people even if I walked for the whole hour . But as I would be walking , I was very desperate and I did n't care if someone decided to kill me . But I would imagine the other death of working for someone who does n't appreciate and it would go beyond my imagination . I told him openly . Then he said to me that , "@ do n't worry , I am going to ask her and find out how the situation is . She supposed to handle you like Rose ... @" [ his daughter ] "@ You should be going to fetch water together , if it is time to dig , you should go and dig together . You should everything together . Because in September if they go to school you will also go . @" To me that sounded impossible , "@ going to school ! @" <EOS>
When was that ? <EOS>
It was in the late June ... in fact the month of June had ended , it was in July . Because I would hear people saying that , "@ there has remained one month or one and half month for students to begin studies . @" <EOS>
Only a month ? No. I would imagine it but I could n't figure it out . "@ How can I go to school ? @" everything I would first think about it in advance . Before , whenever we were going to begin school , everything would be new at home . "@ So , what about now ? Will I start studying and in the evening go to dig ... ? @" I would ask myself but I could n't understand it . I never used to think about such life or believe in it . He told and I chilled because he had told me good news . At least he was sympathetic with me , so it was fine . He used to make me work but at least somehow I see that he would sympathize with me due to the agony that I was baring within me . But it was okay . Therefore , "@ I told him that it was fine . @" He spent some long time at home ; he spent about a whole month at home . Then said that , "@ you all have to go together for water and come back together . @" We would go in the morning ; if it meant early morning , we would all wake up and the wife was there . But we were not on good terms with the wife . If it were digging we would all go . They would dig because they knew how to dig . As for me , I would pick up all the grass and later , we would sit and chat up to mid @-@ day then we would go back home . She would stay at home preparing some food . And he would say , "@ you all have to sit here and share with no quarrels . @" <EOS>
Then he ... during that time I would n't see any problem ; people would move freely . People would come and we talk , I mean people who would come to visit that family . They would not talk about anything like war stories . Therefore , I started getting a feeling that the war stopped . I felt like I should stop hiding myself . People had started cutting the sorghum . Therefore I said , "@ since they have cut this place , there is no other place remaining . I will be walking in the open and if they are to kill me they should kill me . @" <EOS>
So ... a month before students went back to school , Damien travailed . He used to go up country ; I do n't know what he used to do there . Therefore , I said , "@ since he has left , I am going to die . I am going to die a horrible death . @" so I decided not to stay in that home . "@ I would better go @" I decided . It was supposed to be a journey from Gitesi to Mabanza in some place in Rubengera at the other man 's place . [ The place where I lived at first ] . It was a long journey about three or four kilometers on a road . Then I said , "@ let me show you ; I am going to leave Gitesi and go to Rubengera . I will go back to the other home and if I reach there before anyone tries to kill me , that will mean that I will never die . @" <EOS>
Because I was supposed to go through the other road where I used to pass hiding . So I started my journey . She had sent me to go digging . Therefore , I went with children and when we had reached some where , she called them saying that , I must stay there alone . "@ Really ! I stay in the other garden alone ? Why does n't she do the same things when her husband is around ? " I wondered . Immediately I took back the hoe and gave it to the kids and I told them that I have left . "@ Where are you going Mahoro ? Came back we show you . @" They said to me . [ they used to call me Mahoro ] I told them that , "@ No , there is nothing to show me , I have gone and if they kill me , that will be it . And if they do n't kill me , we shall meet some other time . @" <EOS>
I begun my journey to Rubengera . On my way I met about two or three people only . People had stopped moving . Umh ! That scared me too . "@ I have walked three kilometers and I have only met three people . Maybe people finished . Maybe even where I am going they may not be there . where would I go ? @" I was confused . I continued walking alone and finished the journey . I left the other place at around 11:00 a.m. but due to the sorrows , I would move saying , "@ what if I sit here by the roadside ? What if I pretend as if I am looking for some place and then go to ask in a certain home maybe they would shelter me or call upon the killers to kill me in case they can not stand me . @" I had several problems but I would find death as the easiest solution . Umh ? It was the only solution that would get me out of there . Therefore , I kept on delaying on the way and reached there when it was already dark . I reached there at around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. on my way I met very few people like I told you . There was no car passing in the road . Therefore , I said , "@ is over people finished . Where will I go ? @" I asked myself . It also became a problem like the other one . However I never thought about going back . Even if people killed me from the roadside or ... but not colonizing me in a home with the situation that I was in . I believed we would never understand each other . <EOS>
Therefore , I went there and suddenly they saw me coming in at around 6:30 . So they asked me , "@ what has happened ? @" I told them that , "@ I have come . @" So the old lady asked me , "@ why have you come . Well here the war stopped . Few people are moving . @" It was in the end of July . "@ few people are moving you can sit here and tell me what happened where you were . @" Then I told her that , "@ there , Beatrice would take me to dig , send me to fetch water alone while her kids would stay at home . She would tell me that I must work since she hid me . When I realized that I can not manage , I decided to come here . @" She welcomed me and I lived there . With in few days I heard that my sister was still alive . The person , who told me that , seemed to be my second enemy . "@ You are telling me that Doudou is alive ? @" she died and dogs ate her while we were together . I am sure about it . Even other people told me about it . Now you are saying that she is alive ? How ? <EOS>
Then he told me that there somebody who told him that she is alive . So it became another problem and I said , "@ think person is a killer , he is the one who will kill he ; he who is mocking me saying such things . Other people would tell how people died , "@ it is over all people died , you have to be strong though you survived alone . @" But how could he come saying that so and so is still alive yet I was very sure they died ? Then I told him that , "@ never tell me that anymore . @" Then he left , he was a neighbor to that family . Time passed before he came back to tell me about it . In July ... I remember it was in the late July , I had n't known that my sister was alive . We had separated in the 10th of April 1994 , that time we saw a group of attackers . The time she decided to go to them so that they should kill her moving rather than dying sat . <EOS>
I stayed there in that family and there was no problem I would get out by then . I would go at the road and come back safe . I would see children from that family but I would n't see any of the people I used to know . So it became a problem to me . So I asked myself , what is all about such life ? I would try to see the future but I would just go beyond my understanding . Therefore I decide to stay there . The old lady told me that I wait in September I would go to school . But I would not believe it ; "@ I will go to school ? @" But still I would remember that at home , my father used to like children who liked studying . And indeed we liked studying . Both my father and mother were teachers . Therefore they would say that , "@ you must study ... you shall study till when ... @" and we were many kids at home . Mum would tell us that , "@ all of you must study ; you will go secondary schools and complete university . Even though we miss salt at home , you will go school . @" And surely I wanted to study and go secondary schools ... and reach university . Therefore , I would think , "@ where will be living while I am studying ? Whom will I be with ? @" so I would not understand it . I would go through all those things . <EOS>
Then I told her , "@ it is okay I will go to school . @" I knew that I would go to school and maybe meet other people and get to know each other . I would say that , if I am the only one who survived in Rubengera there must be another one who survived from Mushubati . "@ There can not miss someone who survived in other areas like Kibirizi or somewhere else . @" I would say . "@ Even though it would be one person but there is no logic in remaining sat at home . I must study , it is a brilliant idea . @" <EOS>
And I would immediately think , if I reach in school ... before we used to reach school and as we would be entering [ it bothered me too ] we used to enter in school and they would call upon the Tutsi , we would stand up when we are about three . In the following class we would be ten but now they will call and it will be only me . And so they will start saying that , "@ we study with only one Tusti . @" So it would bother me but I would try to avoid such thoughts because it was the only life I had to lead . I knew my life was school life . I had to complete primary school and pass it well so that I would get a school where I would live always . And I would stop living in outside families . I would go to a school where I would stay and live with people I never knew . I started aiming at that goal and I felt like it was the best one . <EOS>
I went to school . Eh ! At break time they would make fun of me . Even those we used to talk together , they would avoid me ; they would behave to me as if I was a stranger . <EOS>
Was that in September when the genocide had stopped ? <EOS>
It was after the genocide . But still moving ... unless I was going to school with other students ... that time people were still hiding ; no one would move out yet these ends things had settled without any problem . Us we were still hiding . Whenever I would not be able to get people to go with or come with , I would find a way of coming back in the dark at night . <EOS>
You were still living in that family ? <EOS>
Yes I was still living in that family . Which means that I was till living in the house . They were no longer searching in houses . But for example there is some man they killed later in September ... in August . A certain man was killed . He screamed ; he was somewhere on the road . There were some sorghum plants ... it was a sorghum plantation so he screamed and they found out that it was someone they had just hit a club . He had hid himself all the time but at last in late August ... in the beginning of September ... because we were preparing to go to school . People were walking in open , me too I would move without any problem . <EOS>
The Inkotanyi had never arrived there ? <EOS>
I had never had of them ; not a small thing ... never . Not even a thought . Maybe they had reached but never came to the village . Maybe they were all around in town . I never though or had about them . Even those we lived together I can not say that they knew about them . Because they used to here that Inkotanyi were n't people , that they were animals , which had big ears with tails . They never knew they were people . By the way , there is a time they ... when they reached at some place called Ku giti kinini ; that is where there is a center in Rubengera next to the commune . They used to say that they saw the Inkotanyi ... that they saw an Inkontanyi 's car passing . Therefore , they would say that , "@ we saw them with big ears with ... @" Umh , generally I would think they were animals . I did n't know anything but I would wonder the kind of death I was going to die and I would not understand it . I never thought that the Inkotanyi would come for the rescue of those who servived . It never crossed my mind . <EOS>
On the first day I went to school but I would see fellow students avoiding me . During break time , I would see some passing by me and talking about me . I would try to talk to one but things would not work . They all looked afraid of talking to me . So I would sit alone at aside . The teacher would ask me , "@ why are you sitting alone ? What are you doing ... what are you thinking about ? Come and play with other kids . @" and I would say , "@ no I do n't want . @" Sometimes I would go back home at around 10:00 . Break time would reach and then other students would get into groups then I would remain alone . Therefore , after a small time I would go home . <EOS>
Then during that time there came ... there was a certain lady we were neighbors . She was selling clothes ; she would come these ends of Nyabugogo to buy clothes on wholesale and sell them in Kibuye . My aunt lived in Muhima and sometimes she would come ... and they knew each other . So one time they met from Nyabugogo . That lady who used to buy clothes from Nyabugogo knew that my sister survived . My sister was living in some home where she had gone ... she met some people who were at the stream harvesting sweet potatoes . That woman was a Tutsi ... she took her home and my sister told her all about her . Then that lady hid my sister in the house but her husband was not aware . Until September that is when we met . As she got out we immediately saw each other . But her husband never knew about it . It was a very big house and therefore , she hid her somewhere in the house and warned her elder children that , "@ nobody should ever open this room . @" And even her husband would never come to the room ; he used to go and come back deep in the night . He would come going to bed directly . Whenever she would want to go to the toilets , that woman would send the kids somewhere and obviously the man would n't be around . Therefore , she would go to the toilets and then come in quickly . She stayed in the house all the time . No other person knew that my sister was in their house except her elder son and daughter plus her . Only the elder children . <EOS>
They were the only ones who knew that there was some one in their house . Even the husband did n't know . But the other woman , who used to purchase clothes for sale , knew about it because she was the one who referred my sister to go and look for Gatabazi 's wife wherever she was and she was also a Tutsi . "@ Go and tell her your problems maybe she may give you shelter . @" She recommended my sister . Therefore , that is how she came to know about it . She was the one who sent a message at Munyagishari 's where I was living saying that , "@ there is a Gahizi 's child in Gatabazi 's home in Gihari . The one that resembled her father , big in size and dark . I wonder her elder sister is maybe she died . @" And , by coincidence I was alive . Then I told them that "@ Sara is telling lies ... she is lying ... she is lying . @" But she said , "@ I am very sure she is alive and in fact I will go to visit her tomorrow . And if I see her I will come to confirm to you . @" She left and the following morning she came to tell me . "@ Do n't worry , she is alive . @" She said to me . <EOS>
Umh , "@ is that possimble ? You should come and take me there . @" I told her . The following day she came back and took me . We crossed some river called Ntaruko . The other side of the river was Gihara sector and when we reached there , I saw her . It was like a dream ; I cann't say that we greated each others , neither did we ask each others about what we went through . We were simply crying by looking at each others . I would look at her and ask myself , "@ is she the one or it is her ghost ? Someone who was bitten by dogs ? Someone I saw landing in the attackers group and being taken by the attackers ? Someone I heard stories of her death , how can she be alive ? @" it was unbelievable though we were face to face . It was like a movie that lasts too long ... yet nobody was talking ... we were talking within our thoughts . It was beyond my imagination and so I got confused . <EOS>
But because she did n't want the head of the family to know about it ( the husband of the lady who saved her ) and the same lady who used to purchase clothes for sale , had already known that our aunties were alive . They were two aunts and they were living these ends . Therefore , she told them that , "@ keep hiding her , if I get their aunties I will tell them and they will come for them . But continue hiding it from your husband so that you do n't get conflicts together at the last moment . He may even decide to chase her yet she has no where to go . @" then she came and I immediately went home . The man had come back so I went back in Gacaca where I lived . And , that woman too left . And when she came to purchase clothes , she met our aunties and then she told them ; "@ do you know that your two kids survived ... ? @" but thought it was impossible ; "@ is there anyone who survived in Kibuye ... ? @" to them it sounded unusual . But she convinced them , "@ it is true at Kibuye some people survived . They never went to the stadium ; they just hid in the neighbor 's homes ... and today they are alive . @" But they never agreed with her . Therefore , she told them that they should sometime come with her and see where we lived . She told them that one lives at Gatabazi and another one lives at Munyagishari 's home . Munyagishari is the one we lived together and they already knew him . After visiting my sister I returned home and went to school . After two days I went to school but I would come home at 10:00 a.m. as usual . However when she told our aunties about it , they immediately boarded and came over . <EOS>
They came ; it was my aunt and the husband to my other aunt . They came to Gacaca they knew the place . When they reached at home they told them that I had gone to school . Therefore , they decided to come to school yet I was on my way coming back home , because I was used to going home at break time . There is a way you see something and become stiff ; I was walking home but even though I was walking , I was careless of what was around me . I would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how I was going to lead it . It seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part . Therefore , we met as I was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) . I used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . Because I would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me . I would talk to no body . So I would feel like life has stopped ... so I would finally go home . <EOS>
As I was going home , we met next to the commune . They were coming to see me at school . It was an extraordinary experience ; it was like similar to the time I saw my little sister after five months of not seeing each other . Each one thought that the other one died . Therefore , I was shocked and stood like a tree . So I ask , "@ Aunt , is it you ? Are you the one I am seeing or it is somebody else ? @" she replied that was the one . "@ Are you aware that Doudou is alive ? @" I asked her once again . She replied me that "@ Doudou is alive and I know where she lives . @" Therefore , we never reached at home where I lived , immediately I took her to Gihara where Doudou ( my sister ) was living . <EOS>
When we got there we saw her . And from there we boarded the taxi that was going to Kigali and left . <EOS>
Which month was that ? <EOS>
It was on the 1st of October in 1994 . <EOS>
Generally , right from April life seemed to be a terrible struggle ? <EOS>
From April to September life was a terrible struggle . <EOS>
Well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined Munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ? <EOS>
When the war siezed ... in July , August the war was siezing ... in fact , in July the war was beginning to sieze . I was living with that family as somebody who was hiding . I was living in Gitesi at her daughter 's home . And due to the way they would treat me , I mean because they hid me I continued believing that they were still hiding me . I never knew that outside the situation improved . Even the time I left their home for Munyagishari 's , I still believe I was going to hide . However , that feeling started disappearing when I started going to school . I could go at home with out any problem , I could eat , there is nothing I was obliged to do . I wouuld wake up the following morning and again go to school . Then I would come home at 10:00 a.m. depending on how I would be abandoned . <EOS>
How could you find your relationship with Munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? How was it ? <EOS>
After the genocide , we continued to live with that lady . Definitely her father was not happy at all because , we survived but all properties were taken from him ; the cows were gone yet he was considering them as a profit . Some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream . One could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper . And from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him . The cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most . She could remember that I need books if it was time for school . <EOS>
Do you meet often ... is there ... ? <EOS>
Yes we met . She got married of recent so we met . She lives just here in Muhima and we visit each other without any problem . <EOS>
What about her home ? <EOS>
I have never gone back to her home . <EOS>
Since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ? <EOS>
No ! <EOS>
Is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ? <EOS>
It is not because I do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means . <EOS>
Does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ? <EOS>
Since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 . <EOS>
Has your property been destroyed ... ? Are there only ruins left ? ... Has it ... <EOS>
The whole village!that village , Kigabiro , was a little bit apart . My grand mother was living there with her five sons who had built their houses there . It was a very big family ! it was a hill standing like....but then the killers destroyed everything without sparing anything . But when we went back there [ after the war ] we found out that...in fact , those people were did n't destroy anyhow , they used to remove bricks one by one then took them at their places to use them building . in 1995 , when we went there , we found that some people had built then put the doors of our home to their houses . Andt the mselves told us , "@ so and so took some bricks from your house and as you can see , they used them to build the fence . And he also put , obviously , the door that was on your house on his ! @" <EOS>
You went back to your place then you found out the doors of your house on ... <EOS>
Yeah ! The doors were still having the same color . You could also see that some of the bricks were from our house . <EOS>
Let 's think back a little bit on the period during the genocide . You spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside...can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ? <EOS>
The days that I spent outside...it 's about a week . In fact , if the perpetrators were to come three times in a week to look for me at Munyagishari 's place @- for example , if they came on Monday , I would n't have to be there on Tuesday and Wednesday ! Otherwise , they would...so they would n't get me whenever they would come . Then , theyy would just come back after two days but the issue of their come back was just about cows though they would pretend that they were looking for someone . Everytime I would be aware of their arrival , I would gao and spend some days in the sorghumfield . <EOS>
It is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield . Can you tell me about the time that you were chased from Munyagishari 's place ? <EOS>
I would just go till...so many times , one would feel like the doors of death were locked up for him @/@ her as he @/@ she would look for dying...the next thing was just going back home and flee again in case the perpetrators were back again and so on...that 's how life was like . <EOS>
I mean all the time right a fter being separated from your sister...was it like one week or...how many weeks did you spend outside ? <EOS>
We stayed in the sorghumfield from april to july and for me , there was no other hiding place . Everytime I was chased from where I was living , my refuge was in the sorghumfield . There was nowhere else I could go ! <EOS>
How was your life like before the Gebnocide ? Tell me a bit about the way your family . did you have many cows , how was your relationship to your relatives ... ? <EOS>
I was just a kid but I could see that life was fine , there was nothing wrong ! We were seven kids and there was no problem at all with my father 's relatives @-@ they were five boys and four girls , all of them were married except one . They were living in that village and it was...I just do n't know how to say it ! it very nice , there is nothing that I would n't miss anything ! All of us @-@ seven kids @-@ were going to school and above all our parents loved us too much and they were the kind of people who always show us love and emphasize education as they were . They were always there to make us feel good to the extent that we would feel like there is nothing wrong that could happen to us . I just do n't know how to express it ! it was like living in paradise without any worry . I never worried at all and I think that 's the reason why it was hard for me to live with people who treated me bad . In fact , I never knew about it ! I was never used to that kind of life , I did n't even see that happening in the neighborhood ! <EOS>
Then after the Genocide , you went to live with relatives . now it 's ten years ago , do you ... ? <EOS>
Ten years ago , I was in the 4th class of primary education and my younger in the third one . After the war , I went back to school and completed the primary level as long as my younger sister . Thereafter , I completed secondary school . Today , my younger sister is in senior six . I lived with my auntie by then till now . Of course life is not the same , it is certainly different from the one during the genocide but it not the same as the one before the genocide . <EOS>
Are you hopeful about future ? <EOS>
In fact , I 've been through all the types of life @:@ good life , normal life and bad times , the future...now as I have grown up , I think @-@ unless I trouble myself like if I remember things that can mamke me act negatively . It is something that happens to me often , I remember that one time as I was going at secondary school , it crossed my mind!I felt...there was even a time when I could think being traumatised because I could n't bear sitting on the same desk with a Hutu student or sharing a meal with him @/@ her or using the same bucket or...for me he @/@ she was kind of pariah , a pariah and I could n't talk to them . however , after a certain time I was no longer behaving that way . I just do n't remember how I changed , maybe it 's Gob because I , personnally , did no effort . I was used to be lonely wherever I was and there was none for me...I was feeling like the only solution was to die because otherwise I would suffer for always . But today , I thank God because I feel free and I am positive about the future if God continues to be with me . <EOS>
Were there times during the Genocide where you could feeling like you would better die than ... <EOS>
Yeah , very often ! That was the best solution for me . <EOS>
Does life make sense for you today or you wish you would die...what 's your impression about life ? <EOS>
Being alive for me is very different from dying . Of course I 'm human and I do n't rejuice everyday but neither do I feel bad everyday @-@ those are two facts about which we can n't anything about . On the other hand , when I imagine myself dead , I fell like...oh!dying is good!it 's good because you rest . I think that if it happened that I was dead , today I would n't be worryinng about people because I may meet someone in the street and start questioning myself about him . When I see that he is not very confortable when we meet , I start thinking that maybe he is the one who killed my people or...I just become inquisitive about him . All this makes me belive that if were n't alive , I would n't have all those problems , I would n't think to do this or that according to the situation , I would just rest . That 's how I think it is . <EOS>
The programme that the government has adopted is to emphasize on the fact that people have got to live in a new way . What do you think about Gacaca and the system of releasing prisonners who have handed themselves over ? Can you tell me what you think about Unity and Reconciliation ? <EOS>
I 'm positive about Gacaca and I really support the idea because I belive that a perpetrator can denounce another one . I think it 's just a way to try to stop people from being afraid or just simplify the situation . But I am sure that if you get a perpetrator somewhere and ask him to tell you exactly what happened bevcause you know that something happened there , he will n't tell you anything ! I think they shoud talk and say exactly what happened and say things like "@ I was here and this is how it was ... @" then he can plead guilty or deny his participation or say that he had been influenced ... <EOS>
As far as unity and reconciliation is concerned , I think ... Just the fact that one recognizes the wrong they 've done makes their sentence less severe . But personally , I do not agree with that way of doing it . This should be the case only if the killer feels guilty of what they did because otherwise , it would be a way of reducing their punishment while they do not have any conscience . I am saying this because you can meet somebody ... I always meet many people ... when you meet somebody whom you saw killing , they take a different route or they turn back and flee . If it were somebody who has truly acknowledged their wrong ... or maybe they only did it in order to have their punishment reduced because if they had truly confessed , they should even be able to recount everything in details especially because they know very well there 's nothing we can do against them . Because if that was your intention , if you wanted them imprisoned , you 'd know where to find them anyway . That 's why I do not agree with the whole process . Personally , I would n't release a prisoner just because they 've acknowledged their wrong deeds . Maybe it was fine at first ; it looked like a way of reducing problems , at least that 's the impression it got . That 's what I think . You will hear people saying that anyone would agree to plead guilty just to have their punishment reduced and that does n't necessarily mean that they feel guilty for the wrong they did . They are n't even able to publicly confess and to recount the events of the time in details . You know very well that when you have something on you conscience , talking about it does you good . The weight of it feels much lighter once you 've shared it with someone else . <EOS>
So , in my opinion , releasing someone just because they admit what they did , releasing a hundred ... a hundred people ... I think it 's a way of simplifying things . I do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be . We should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time . Some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail . At the end of it all , we realize that 's how things work . <EOS>
After genocide , the country had to face the problem of orphans ... What do you think of the way the current government takes care of orphans ? Do you think it is enough ? What do you think of the way you 're treated by the rest of the society ? Do they pay you a visit ... ? <EOS>
I think they really give their best because right after the genocide , no survivor ever thought they 'd one day go back to school or that they 'd even beneficiate from any medical care . Today , we have the Funds of Assistance to Genocide Survivors , Fonds d' Assistance aux Rescapés du Génocide ( FARG ) in French . It helps in paying survivors ' school fees . Survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from . I am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness . There are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today . The Government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... I think it 's good . <EOS>
You have been an orphan for quite a long time despite the fact that you 're an adult today ... do you have a message to give to other children who survived the genocide the way you did ? <EOS>
In fact , the most important thing ... well , it 's a personal comment but it is a difficult life that requires patience and perseverence . It is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that . I have had the grace of knowing God and I know He can do anything ! I would therefore tell the survivors that it is God who protected them during the wat , nobody else did ! I would invite them to live a prayerful life because without Him , no one would be where they are at today . Through prayer we find a certain peace that helps us to accept what happened and we understand that it had to happen that way . And also that God is not unaware of what is happening to us . But it 's only when one undertands the importance of prayer that we can be able to reach such a conclusion . On the other hand , orphans are confronted to various problems , they are n't stable and ... they do not understand that things come and go . Some of them behave very badly without realizing where the money for the education comes from . They do not ask themselves how things would be if they were n't the way they are . It is very clear that some students are n't serious about their school work at all and yet it should be their number 1 priority . My message for them is to be aware that they are orphans and that they should n't so much count on the families with which they live . Whatever they do , they should n't forget that they are orphans ! They should n't forget where they are coming from because the moment one recalls where they are coming from , their behaviour gets better . <EOS>
This testimony will be watched by many people , maybe even by your grandchildren . I would n't want to let you go without giving you an opportunity to give a message to those who will watch it , something that 's on your heart . This is therefore the opportunity to tell us what is on your heart and what your wishes are . <EOS>
Thank you very much ! The message I would like to give as I said from the beginning is a message of love , everyone needs to love their neighbour wherever they are . I am convinced that if everyone had shown love for one another , what happened would never have happened . No father would have killed his own children ! There was no love at all during genocide . Everyone is supposed to love their neighbour as they love themselves . I know it is not easy but at least we should make some effort ! Because when you love your neighbour as you love yourself , you will never think of killing him or her or of making him or her into an orphan but you will have compassion for them instead . You would want to put yourself in their shoes , you would think of a situation where you get sick and there 's nobody to take care of you ... So all I am asking is that people love their neighbour as themselves . It is very difficult especially for orphans and for those who lost their loved ones ... it is very difficultn for someone who is n't ‘ saved ’ to ... to understand that there 's nothing good in revenging . It is true that your people were killed but it is over ! I am not saying they should forget , I myself can not forget , it is something that will always be part of me . And when one remembers how it happened , it becomes ... depending on the period in which we are , things are the way they are . We should n't forget what happened because remembering , looking at where we are at today and being able to that despite everything , there 's some improvement . Because that period was part of another life . Today , we 're in another life . The life in which we were and today 's life ... We need to think about it but that 's not a reason to cnstantly live in the past without thinking of anything else . Yes , we need to remember , just like it is impossible to forget that we were born and that we shall die one day . But thinking about it ... we need to think about it with the intention to show gratitude to God for what He did , by looking at where you came from and where you are at today , gratitude for the fact that you have reached the time in which we are living today . I believe there 's nothing wrong with thinking about it as long as we are not living in the past . We need to think about it in the sense of ... yes , to think abou tit . And also to have love and to be able to forgive . Personally , I have completely forgiven them ! I have forgiven them because I know they did it because ... I know they did it ... but maybe as they say it themselves , they were only tools in the hands of someone else or some other power . <EOS>
Personally , I do not understand how a human being healthy of mind can attack another human being with 2 ears , 1 nose , legs ... just like him or her . A human being like him or her ! And they take a machete , hack him or her down and see blood shedding ... it is beyond understanding . Personally , I do n't think that person did it by himself or herself , but they were used by Satan to an extent where I have forgiven them all , it does n't matter whether they have asked for forgiveness or not . What happened happened and it is true that I can not forget it . For those who are still in school , I would tell them to seriously study and to prepare themselves a better future . It happens at times that they want to behave in a certain way depending on the town in which they live or which school they go to , but it should n't be the case . A child should not forget what is behind maybe just because he or she is lucky enough to live with a well @-@ off family and thus behave as though he or she should n't live in a certain way . <EOS>
I believe you see some with AIDS not because they walked in such or such ways but because she wanted something and could n't afford it . Not because they ... I do n't know how to put it ... It is just because they wanted to do what their fellows did hoping that she would be as successful as their fellow was . But that is not the way things are . All the time you have to ask yourself , "@ who am I ? @" thinking about who you are ... the kind of a person you are , and then you behave according to who you are rather than imitating someone else . <EOS>
Do you have anything to add on ? <EOS>
I guess that is enough . <EOS>
