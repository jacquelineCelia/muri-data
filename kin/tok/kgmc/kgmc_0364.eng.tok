My name is Mrs. Pierrot Helene Moonback . We have been living in this cell Nyakabanda since 1986 . When we arrived there , they were very many peole ; the natives but the majority were the Tutsis who at the same time faced problems . This place is called Nyakabanda cell and before , it was known to be part of Kanombe district but after 1990 when the war started it was made to be part of Kicuciro district up to now . <EOS>
In 1994 ... if I start telling you from the beginning ; from the time political parties rose , how roads were blocked by the militias to stop people from moving from place to place , how we failed to find way to the market places , the story would be so long and it can take much time to say all of it . I will tell you old the events , which took place in the last week or I will begin from the death of Gatabazi and Bucyana , who was a CDR member . That is when we started getting many problems . That is when many people ( the Tutsi ) were killed . They used to get young boys who would be going to their homes and take their clothes off and force them to wear combat and Boots . They would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them Inkotanyi , yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well . <EOS>
Then , they would be killed just over there . A certain old man called Théodore Bizimana decided to shift ; he fled and left this place because of the smeil of corpses , which they used to dump in front of his home every morning . During that time , they used to enter people 's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted @: either at night or daytime . They could take any thing they wished from people 's houses and beat anyone they wanted to beat . I remember sometime , it was on the Hory Thursday towards Esther . I was going to church and as I reached just in front , I saw a certain boy who was caught by the presidential guards . It was close to the home of Nsabimana 's sister , this Nsabimana was a soldier and he had another name ; he was called Castar . <EOS>
Around , there was a shop where they used to gather and take alcohol , there was also a certain boy , so they caught him and reached a very huge stone ; these stones used for making foundations for houses and hit it to that boy . I sreamed but a certain old lady who was living around here , she was called Dina , she was also moving in the same direction like me and besides hearing , I never knew what was taking place . Then she told me while she was pulling my arm , "@ let 's procced , it is the Interahamwe ( militias ) killing the other Tutsi . @" Then I asked her "@ what did he do ? @" "@ He is accused of being a Tutsi and stop talking about it , otherwise they will kill you too . @" I procceded but I was very frightened . However , as I reached at the corner I saw soldiers . I told them that there was somebody who was being killed . But when they realized that he had a Tutsi appearance , they replied to me in French because I had talked to them in French , so they said , "@ laisse @- le , lui il a le droit de mourrir . @" Meaning , "@ leave him , he has right to die . @" that is what that man told me . So I procceded . <EOS>
And then , on the sixth at night we heard that ... hope you can see that we are neighbouring the airport . I heard an explosion of an Europlain , however we did n't know it was a europlain . Then later in about two or one hour 's time we started hearing grenades around the neighbourhood . They were terribly many and unsual in fact somewhere in the neighbourhood , someone screamed and when he screamed we heard a grenade exploded . When the second grenade was exploded , that person stopped screaming and never screamed again . The trend continued until deep in the night at around 03:00 a.m. and we had not known what had happened . <EOS>
When president Habyarimana . J. @"@ Ikinani @" died they cut the cabble , which supplied electricity in our area . They cut it in order to stop us from communicating with embassies because they knew that some how we must be in tough with a certain embassy ; therefore , they knew we could call the embassy and tell them the situation around our area . Therefore , they cut the cabble that used to supply up to this place . Frankly speaking , I can not clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time , there were no electric phones . At least they would have disconnected the communication system and leave the electricity . Then in the morning we heard that the president died . We got the rumours from the neighbours because we could n't listen to the radio because we had no electricity . They had started burning people 's houses and killing people . <EOS>
They started from up there at a certain widow 's home . She was called Claudette Muteteri . Her husband was called Mutsinzi . Mutsinzi was a Hutu but he died before the war . A week before her death ... ( I had forgotten to tell you this but I have remembered as I mentioned her name ) between her home and Aloys ' ( Ngirabatware Aloys was the president of the militias ) home , there was a field where all of us would gather for meetings . In that meeting , it was where the security problem was mentioned . <EOS>
Therefore , my husband Pierrot acted so brave and raised his hand and asked , "@ I would like to ask Aloys some question @: the militias he lead are the ones who are killing people of this area and kill them from here . Yet everyone knows that those people belong here ! Do you want tell us that you do n't know where the Inkotayi are living ? They are in CND . Why do n't you find them there and kill them ? In stead you attack this poor widow ‘ Claudette ’ and menace her . @" They could never let her sleep for a minute . Everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish . When the genocide begun , she was killed first in our area . And then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called Modeste ( I do n't remember his other name ) to go and face Aloys about that issue . However , we were very worried ; we knew that no body goes to Aloys ' home and comes out alive . We thought they would die . <EOS>
Therefore , they decided to meet him the following day . But since my husband was the one who was brave to ask that question , as we had just reached at home tracing somewhere to sit , we saw everybody who was affected by the security problem coming to our home . Most of the people who would come were Tutsis . Therefore , we came up with a dicision of shifting in that same week . My husband started shifting people ; he had a track , so he would shift people at night . At night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas . They begun from across there , that is where they would always attack . We had also planned to shift on Saturday ; we had got a house in Kabgayi for rent . Unfortunately , that was when the serious killings begun . Others had left ; it was a few families and us who had stayed . <EOS>
On Thursday morning ... it was on the 7th of April ; they came wearing dry banana leaves , some things , which looked like wings on their heads . I saw them from the window and got so scared because I thought they were coming to kill us . Fortunately , there was a certain man who once was a bergomaster in Nyarugenge commune ; he was called Bakomera Jean Pierre . He stopped them and told them that , "@ do n't attack these people , they are not Rwandans . Just leave them . @" <EOS>
But we could hear them asking him that , "@ but they appear on the list ! @" they had a list of names on a shit of a paper . Therefore , they would ask him , "@ their names appear on this list . @" And , others would say , "@ these people are Belgians and even if they were n't , their parents ( mothers ) were Tutsis because there is no Belgian who ever married a Hutu . Which means they are Tutsis . @" Then , I could hear some voices saying , "@ heee ... they have two sins ; the first one being the fact that they are Belgians and the second one , being Tutsis . @" However , that man pleaded and pushed them back . <EOS>
Because all our neighbours had sought refuge in our home with a belief that , since it was in a white family no body would guess they were there or bather to come . Personally I thought so . Therefore , I would put them in the bedrooms and under the beds . Then us , we remained in the colidor thinking that , "@ if they find us in the colidor they would n't bather to check . @" Therefore , I asked him to get out , "@ if they find you outside , they will not have a chance to enter because if they enter they will search around the house . @" I explained to him . Finally , he got out and when he reached out there , he told them that he was sick ; truly he was sick . Therefore , they told him that , "@ let us go . @" As they had reached in front , they said , "@ in this home there are traitors ! @" but one of them said , "@ do n't search them now . Let 's first go up to the end . @" He said so because the Inkotanyi had already captured that area of Remera at the Stedium . And fortunately they did n't come home . They looked scared and when they reached in front at the juction of the roads , they started saying , "@ among us they are traitors and suddenely the shootings from the Inkotanyi increased . Therefore , they went back and said that they should ensure security right from their homes . "@ About that home , we shall see it later . @" They said . That is how they left without searching our home . And , as he had just entered in the house , they throw a grenade to our house ; it landed on the roof , however no body was hurt ; it affected the roof only ; the roof split into pieces . <EOS>
The following morning ... on Friday we fled . We saw very many people fleeing therefore ; we also decided to join them . We were with our neighbours ; I was with my husband , my five children and one of them was a one year and two months old baby and my brother . We went and reached those ends of Rubirizi , where we found other people and joined them . We continued together up to Butare . We reached in Burundi on the 05th May 1994 . <EOS>
However it is a long story about the experience in Burundi . Therefore , we came back and reached here on the 16th July , 1994 . When I left Burundi , it was a few days after the Inkotanyi had captured Kigali . Therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind . But I found when this part was demolished . Even the other house of ours was demolished . <EOS>
So I had to ask what took place when we left . I asked the neighbours ; some were cawards and they would say the truth but today , no body can tell you what happened . <EOS>
After they took off the car , they saw a pit hole , where water from bathrooms used to flow . Then they said that it was dug for the Hutus so , they dicided to bury there the Tutsis . They could take their clothes off and kill them in a way that , one could n't identify them after the war . There is a certain lady who had sought refuge in this area ; she was dumped in that pit yet she was pregnant . She had eight months pregnance . We never knew their names or where they were coming from . The Interahamwe dumped her in the pit where she spent five days agonizing before dying . Later a certain man who was my neighbour ; he lived in the house close to ours . He got a very big stone and threw it to her in the pit and killed her finally . <EOS>
After some time we wanted to exhume their remains for proper reburial . After reconstructing our house , we asked the ministry of social affairs to help us in the act of exhuming and reburying those remains of people . However , they seemed not to consider that as an agent issue yet we could n't continue living in someone 's house . A certain relative had sheltered us but we did n't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house . We came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there . We would consol on ourselves that , "@ after all they are our people , we can live in the house while they are still there . There is no problem . @" We started living in our house and four years later ... in 1998 that is when in the name Kicuciro district there was a decision to exhume and rebury all the remains of people who lived in this area . Then , they came to our home too . We first found about four skulls but when we scooped deeper , more fifty @-@ nine bodies were found , which still had fresh . And , one could easily identify that woman who was pregnant ; she still had braids and nails . She even had fresh and one could see that she was pregnant although her belly was deformed . We found children 's remains inside , men and women . One could tell women from their hair ; they still had hair . <EOS>
However , we could n't tell who was who ; most people from this area , who lost their beloved ones , came here to see if they would find them . The worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people 's death could n't tell us the names of people who died there . Among them , they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas . However , the people who witnessed them the day they were killed could n't tell us who they were . We even tried to contact my neighbour ( our houses are next to each other ) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim 's remains . He stood in his home and could peep through his fencing ; he did n't want to come here . It is hard to know the people who died here . Up to now he can not tell you the truth ; he says that he saw the Interahawe so and so passing by . People 's remains are everywhere ; just in front here , there are remains , even in our gardens they are others . There is a time we wanted to dig in our garden but as one would dig in the soil , could fine a skull . In fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here . <EOS>
I guess that it all I can say about that pit . But I left all the weapons they used to kill them in the pit . Knives , the car chassis , stones ... all those weapons were stained with blood . Therefore , we just buried them in the pit although we never covered it completely . <EOS>
Were the victims hacked or shot to death ? <EOS>
They used to hacke them ... they could be hacked because those days you would bribe to be shot . Or else one wwould be so kind to shot you . Otherwise they could be hacked and others would be hit to death using clubs . They joined the Interahamwe later but before they were our neighbours ; they were people we knew very well . When we came back , they were the people who seized our properties . We found spiked clubs in their homes ... lonng knives ; they left them in their home and ran away . However , in our area , the Interahamwe who were led by Aloys , were the ones who did all those deeds . <EOS>
As you said that it was the Interahamwe who were led by Aloys , who did all those deeds . Which kind of person was Aloys ? And , how many Interahamwe ( militias ) came here ? <EOS>
Aloys was the president of the Interahamwes . His full names were Aloys Ngirabatware . He was an origin of Gisenyi and closely related to the family of the ex @-@ president ; he had married Mbonabaryi 's daughter . Mbonabaryi Noel was Habyarimana 's ( ex @-@ president ) brother.in.law . He was the head of all the Interahamwe of this area . Additional to that , after the genocide , in his house people found there bags of guns , bullets , corespondance documents , lists of people who were supposed to be killed , lists of Interahamwe ... there were so many things . But people who seized his properties burnt some of the things ; they never knew the value of those things . I just got a few of the information on small papers and the little information I got , was from some body from that home who had gathered them and called me . He told me abiout what took place there and so I rushed for the remaining information and brought it here . <EOS>
