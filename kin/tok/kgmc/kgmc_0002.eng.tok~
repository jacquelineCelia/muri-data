I would like to ask you ... <EOS> But first , what is your name and your birthday ? <EOS>
My name is Uwimana Richard . <EOS> I was born on 8/08/1979 . <EOS>
Where were you born ? <EOS>
I was born in Kigali , Nyarugenge and more precisely in Nyarugenge . <EOS>
How old were you at the time of the genocide ? <EOS>
During the genocide , I was 15 years old . <EOS>
What 's your name and where were you born ? <EOS>
My name is Uwimana Richard . <EOS> I was born in Kigali in an area called Nyarugenge . <EOS> I was born on 8/08/1979 . <EOS>
So how old were you at the time of the genocide ? <EOS>
I was 15 during the genocide . <EOS>
Could you tell me where you were during the genocide , from its first day ? <EOS>
When the genocide started ... <EOS> It was no surprise to me because ... <EOS> When the genocide began , I remember that ... <EOS> It did not start with the crash of Habyarimana 's plane . <EOS>
There were some signs before the genocide happened . <EOS> I remember that when it started , I had spent some time discussing the situation with my parents . <EOS> People would avoid returnig home late ... <EOS>
I remember that even Dad and Mom were never out after 4pm . <EOS> At 4pm o'clock they were all at home . <EOS> When the genocide began , I remember that I was at home in a small house attached to the main one . <EOS> When the genocide started , I rushed to see my parents who were in the main house and tell them @: ‘ the situation is critical ! ’ <EOS>
Then he said @: ‘ What ? Critical ? ’ <EOS> And he added @: ‘ this is the beginning of the genocide . <EOS> Something is going to happen . ’ <EOS>
Then I deducted that the killings were going to start , but there had been some precursor signs . <EOS> When I listened to the radio in the morning , I heard that the presidential plane was shot down . <EOS> I remember that my big brothers and I lived in the small house attached to the main house ... <EOS> I went to knock at the main house then Dad opened . <EOS> I told him straightaway . <EOS>
That 's when he told me that the killings were going to start . <EOS> We had already talked about what happened in the 1950s ... <EOS> Most of us were told about that during that time . <EOS> Then after telling Dad about the situation of the killings , he told me @: ‘ the killings have started . ’ <EOS> I remember that on that same date at 2pm , Dad told us @: ‘ Boys , you must look for places to hide . ’ <EOS>
We had spent the whole morning together . <EOS> Mum was overwhelmed and I sensed that something terrible was going to happen . <EOS>
Dad told us to look for a hiding place , and then we left to find one . <EOS> I remember that the plane crash happened on 6th April 1994 around 8pm ; <EOS> The following day , on 7th , Dad told us , the boys , to look for places to hide . <EOS> He said that after noticing that the situation in the neighbourhood was desperate because the families of Focas and John had already been killed . <EOS> He probably realized that we were next . <EOS>
undefined <EOS>
The reason to think that the killings would reach us ... <EOS> In fact , we were not really informed about what our parents went through in the past though we were roughly told that they had a bad history . <EOS> My parents lived in Bugesera and I think you know well that in 1950s , 1970s ... Tutsis were deported there and they were beaten <EOS> And I think that you also know that there were some Tsetse flies there with which to kill them . <EOS>
Now the genocide starts ... <EOS> But a little bit before then , towards the end of January 1993 during the multiparty system ... <EOS> That 's when we really knew about our ethnic group and Dad kept warning us saying @: ‘ this killing concerns us . ’ <EOS> And when it happened , I realized that we were going to be killed . <EOS> Then you could picture other people who would die just like you , and some Tutsi neighbours had already been killed . <EOS>
What really proved to me that the killings concerned us , the Tutsis , is ... <EOS> Let me start with our neighbours to help you understand that this is something that everybody was afraid of . <EOS> I remember that all our neighbours who were not Tutsis started to go down in the streets with guns , grenades and other weapons for killing . <EOS>
I remember that I had been sent to go to get sugar from a small neighbouring shop . <EOS> As soon as I stepped outside the door , I noticed some neighbours @- kids that I used to play with ... <EOS> When I said hi to them , they said to me @: ‘ Where are you going ? Go back home ! ’ <EOS>
That 's when I returned home and said to Dad @: ‘ It 's terrible ! People are killing each other in the streets . ’ <EOS> At that time , two families that were friends of mine had already been killed @: the families of Focas and John . <EOS> That 's when I said to Dad @: ‘ things are terrible ! ’ and that 's when he said to us @: ‘ find yourselves some hideouts . ’ <EOS>
Carry on with your story <EOS> Tell us how many people died in your family . <EOS>
After Dad told us to find hiding places , I remember that I went to say my farewell to Mom , she looked down , and she was reading the bible and never said a word . <EOS> I said goodbye to my Dad , then replied @: ‘ Okay , we shall meet again . ’ <EOS> I left with my big brother and went to a centre named IWACU ku Kabusunzu . <EOS> When we got there , my big brother told me @: ‘ stay right here , I 'll be back in a short while . <EOS> I must go and see how our parents are doing . ’ <EOS> I entered in the centre and stayed there , and my brother went home and never came back to that centre . <EOS> The rest of the family had spent the night of 7th April at home and only left on 8th April 1994 , the day our home was attacked . <EOS>
Actually they never left on that day ... <EOS> We were a family of 7 children , Dad and Mom which makes a total of 10 people including the maid . <EOS> They sought refuge in the neighbours ' homes , but when they reached the first neighbour 's house , the latter told them after few days that they would not continue to hide them . <EOS> They threw my family outside the door but the reality behind it is that they were interested in looting other people 's properties , So my family left and looked for another place to hide . <EOS>
But right after being chased , they dispatched . <EOS> Dad took his own way , so did Mom and so did the children , and my big brother left with two younger brothers and my sister . <EOS>
So we stayed there .... <EOS> After I left home on 8th April 1994 , the centre where I was was attacked . <EOS> They threw grenades inside the centre and we ran outside ... <EOS> I left and while running away , and I met an Interahamwe who was our neighbour and was a gendarme , <EOS> I do n't remember his name . <EOS> Then he asked me @: ‘ where are you going ? ’ and I replied @: ‘ I am looking for a place to hide because they 're trying to kill us . ’ <EOS> Then he asked me @: ‘ how much money do you have ? ’ <EOS> I said @: ‘ I only have 200Rwf , ’ and I gave him the money , and then he showed me a tree in which I hid . <EOS>
I stayed in that tree until 22/04/1994 . <EOS> That morning , around 6 o'clock , I saw Dad , Mom and my big brother , first they brought Mom and killed her then my big brother who was the second born of the family , affected by what had just happened came running ... they killed him immediately . <EOS>
Did you know the people who conducted the killings ? <EOS> Did you know the reason why they were acting so , and what were you thinking about them ? <EOS>
While watching how people were killing each other ... the killers were ordinary neighbours . <EOS> For instance , the man of the house where Mom hid is the one who handed her in to the killers , and his name was Nepo . <EOS> Dad was even his Godfather , and it was very sad to realize that Nepo was a high profile killer in that area . <EOS> There are other people like Munyagisenyi ... <EOS> People who killed in my neighbourhood were just ordinary neighbours . <EOS>
After they got killed , there was a house at the foot of the tree in which I was hiding . <EOS> The man of that house was named Jean Pierre , and he called me ... <EOS> He was a Tutsi but was married to a Hutu woman , and he was not killed yet . <EOS> I went to his house and he hid me for 2 days , and there was a man named Adolphe who knew where I was hiding there , and he came and told me that my siblings were at Gisimba 's orphanage . <EOS>
I went there ... <EOS> Ordinarily , it is a 15-minute walk but due to all the roadblocks set all over the street , I only managed to get there after two days , and wherever I went , the streets were full of corpses ... <EOS> I only got there 2 days later . <EOS>
I found many people when I reached there . <EOS> Around 400 people were hiding there . <EOS> We are really grateful for having hidden people there and for resisting the assaults , which was not easy at all . <EOS> That is where my siblings and I survived , and later we left Gisimba orphanage but during the time we were there , they tried to kill us every day . <EOS> It happened sometimes that some of the people got abducted from the orphanage and got killed , and I remember that they , the killers , lied to the doctor who took care of us , saying there that there was someone seriously wounded in the street that needed his help , and they killed the doctor ! <EOS>
That was our daily lifestyle , and were prepared to die any time , and we were lucky to realize that the war was over , and people took us from the Gisimba orphanage to St Michel cathedral . <EOS> We stayed at St Michel until the end of the war , which was then that we realized that the type of killing that had just happened was against an ethnic group . <EOS> That was then that we decided to call it genocide . <EOS>
I remember that when it was happening , we called it ‘ killings ' and other names but later , after understanding the fact , a word defining that killing was discovered even though it was not part of our language , and we were informed that it was a genocide perpetrated towards the Tutsis . <EOS>
What hurts you the most when you remember the genocide ? <EOS>
Every time I remember the genocide , what hurts me the most is the way they killed my parents . <EOS> I remember that it happened one morning . <EOS> The night preceding that morning ... <EOS> Ordinarily I always stayed in the tree and never went down on the ground . <EOS> But that night , I kept on falling down , about 4 times , and then at dawn around 6 o'clock , I saw my mother being shot then it was my Dad 's turn , and they shot him too . <EOS> Then they shot my big brother , and that picture can never be erased of my memory ! <EOS>
At the foot of the tree in which I hid , there was a pit , which is where my parents were killed , and many people were killed there everyday . <EOS> So all those images keep on coming back to me , and I see them every time that I remember it . <EOS> That 's what I see every time the word genocide is mentioned . <EOS>
The second thing that hurt me in the genocide was that walk from where I was hiding to the Gisimba orphanage . <EOS> It is ordinarily a 10-minute walk but it took me 2 days . <EOS> But what I saw within those 2 days is equivalent to 100 years , I should say . <EOS> I witnessed killings beyond understanding , and the reason why I am saying that it hurt me a lot is because you would see all that and not get hurt , and you would just stay there numb like a tree , and you would n't shed a tear or anything , and that 's what hurt me the most during the genocide . <EOS>
What do you do in your everyday life ? <EOS>
After the genocide , we kept on struggling against the consequences of the genocide . <EOS> Today I have completed my secondary education . <EOS> I work at the Gisozi Genocide Memorial Centre full @-@ time , which is not easy at all because everyday takes me back to the life during the genocide . <EOS>
But in particular as someone who experienced it , it helps me , and it makes me feel that our loved ones did not just pass away and get forgotten ! <EOS>
I work at the Kigali Genocide Memorial located in Gisozi . <EOS> I work in the Documentation department . <EOS>
Have you accepted the loss of your parents or you live with it every day ? <EOS> What helps you move forward ? <EOS>
Saying that we have accepted the loss of our loved ones is hard . <EOS> When it comes to parents , I think everyone knows the value of a parent . <EOS>
It is not easy for me to accept the loss of my parents but I try . <EOS> And this gives me the courage to struggle for a better life because those who killed us are still out there and we meet them every day . <EOS> They definitely do not wish us to live but everyday one tries to do what 's good so that those who destroyed our lives do not rejoice , though it is n't easy . <EOS>
In our everyday life , we encounter various difficulties in general . <EOS> Sometimes people are mistaken that genocide survivors need money but the reality is that they need people close to them , people they can talk to . <EOS> Because they live with genocide everyday and when the lack of means is added to that , things become more complicated , and we try to find a better way of life , but it 's not easy . <EOS>
Do you ever get desperate ? <EOS>
Desperate ? <EOS> Yes I get desperate sometimes . <EOS> When I think about ‘ I need to go to University , I need to improve my life status ... ' but when realize that you work every day to achieve that and it does n't happen , it leads you to desperation . <EOS> But I have a gift ... <EOS> I think I mentioned that I work at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre , I happen to meet with people who have more problems than I do and that gives me the power to say @: ‘ Let 's look for ways to make a better life . ’ <EOS>
I guess you are talking about orphans . <EOS> Could you tell us about their life today ? <EOS>
It is true that there are many people suffering from the consequences of the genocide . <EOS> I will give you some cases @: <EOS> there are people living with machete cuts . <EOS> There are some people whose houses were destroyed and no rehabilitation was done . <EOS> Some children can not go to school because they undergo trauma ... <EOS> There are many different problems . <EOS> Above all that there are children who live alone and who do not have the capacity to take care of their siblings but who do because they have to . <EOS>
Now the question is ‘ what is the question that keeps coming back ? <EOS> We have accepted all that even though it 's hard but the question is which of them is the most difficult ? <EOS> Today those who killed our loved ones are out there , they are getting freed and their sentence reduced simply because they admitted their crimes . <EOS> Today you meet with the one who killed your loved ones , and the genocide perpetrators get to go back to their families and rebuild their lives , and they move forward while you keep on living the same way you used to when they found you there . <EOS>
Another issue is Justice to the survivors @- if this is what will put them at ease , because to this day , there are people who have n't found yet the remains of their loved ones , and then we claim talking about forgiving the genocide perpetrators who so @-@ called confessed to their crimes while finding the body of your loved one is very hard . <EOS> This is a pain that one bears inside @: <EOS> Losing your loved ones and missing their bodies . <EOS>
There are other different things ... <EOS> Widows can not look after their kids and live in houses in bad conditions . <EOS> There are also kids who do n't go to school and who live in houses in bad conditions . <EOS> Briefly the life of genocide survivors is not good at all . <EOS> Also there are people outside the country who claim to have done heroic acts ... <EOS> I think you heard about the movie called Hotel Rwanda . <EOS> Rusesabagina , the main guy behind it , tells his so @-@ called heroic deeds to the whole world and gets awards here and there . <EOS> He also gets a lot of money but when you look at what he does with that money , you realize that he uses it for purpose of revisionism . <EOS>
So it is very sad . <EOS> So if you consider the life status of the survivors of the Tutsi genocide ... <EOS> Then you realize that today , they should n't be living in sorrow because it is the world that abandoned them , so I do n't understand why they can not turn back and help them . <EOS>
So referring to all that we stated above , I would simply say that we need help . <EOS> Whoever has the potential , whoever is still breathing ... <EOS> People who survived the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda need people next to them . <EOS>
When I say next to them , do not directly think that I am talking about money . <EOS> Some people just need people they can talk to . <EOS> But let 's leave that aside . <EOS> Today we have people who survived the genocide and who have nowhere to live . <EOS> They are there wandering with no help at all . <EOS>
Today we have people who still bear scars of the genocide in their bodies and they still have no access to medical care . <EOS> Today we have kids who do n't go to school . <EOS> Why ? <EOS> Because those who help them have a very limited potential . <EOS> Then sometimes you hear people saying that if a kid does n't have a certain grade , they can not pursue their education , but one needs to know that they are not responsible for the problems that they have . <EOS>
So after stating all those problems , I would say that the survivors of the Tutsi genocide have very big problems . <EOS> In addition the killings are still carried on towards the survivor of the 1994 killings . <EOS> Last year , in 2007 , about 14 people were killed , and since the beginning of this year , this March , as we approach the commemoration period , 5 people are already dead ! <EOS>
All this to say that the survivor of the genocide has no stable life today . <EOS> Besides not having a stable life , they can not even say that they really survived the genocide . <EOS> This leads me to say that whoever has some humanity within their heart should stand today and say ‘ Genocide , never again , ’ but this time thinking about what to do for those people . <EOS>
People need to stand and fight against this type of killings , since today people continue to be killed because they are Tutsis . <EOS>
So considering all that happens on this planet ... <EOS> The Holocaust happened and people said ‘ Never again ’ , <EOS> There are even genocides that are not yet recognized while they happened , but the Rwandan genocide happened , <EOS> But there are many people out there who still deny it ! <EOS> But what can we do as human beings ? <EOS>
Personally I say this to you @: <EOS> We must stand up and weigh every word that comes out of our mouths and also take into consideration what God will ask us because God put us on this Earth and gave us intelligence @- and not the intelligence to kill and destroy his creation . <EOS>
What does this mean ? <EOS> Though I am telling you that there are people who still die in Rwanda because they are Tutsis , because they survived the genocide of 1994 with people aiming to exterminate them all ... <EOS> it is not just about Rwanda ! <EOS> Today people talk about Genocide in Darfur ! <EOS> So as a Rwandan and in particular as a survivor of the 1994 Tutsi genocide , due to what I went through , I can not stop myself from saying ‘ let the genocide of Darfur end and let the people of Darfur have peace . ’ <EOS>
