My name is Nshimiyimana Claude . We were living in Kicuciro , in Ngoma district in Ngoma zone . <EOS>
Eh , before the genocide ... well , I was living with my parents . I was in primary school . I was with my younger brothers . I had a good life with no concern as far as school fees are concerned ; we were living in peace as a family . But later things changed . Bad times came from April 1994 ; that is when we started suffering due to the genocide . People were hunted , I lost my family members ; I had about sixty relatives but they all died and I am the only one survivor . <EOS>
When they came home to kill , they were very many . Some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons . So they came home and found us there . We were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else . Therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . Or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together . <EOS>
So it happened but ... well , I managed to escape . They came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people . Soldiers came first and then the Interahamwe followed . They [ Interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] . They used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ . <EOS>
Then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... I am the one who came out of there alive . It was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many . As I was lying down , I stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . There were only floods of blood . <EOS>
But because by then I was ... well , I had become numb ; I could n't think of doing anything at that time yet I needed to find my way out of that place . It was n't easy to leave that place because I was difficult to find space where to step . <EOS>
Well , I hid myself and I was lucky to see a new day . That is when I got out of that place . I thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing I was waiting for . Then I thought , " Let me find a way of protecting myself and see if I would survive . @" <EOS>
I escaped them . Even those who came later ... In fact , I left a green shirt where I was shot ; I was at the back . So I left my shirt there and the following morning , when some people came to loot , they realized that someone had managed to escape . They tried to look for me but they could n't find me . They even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed . But I did n't hide near there , I continued fleeing . It was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing . I looked for a way of going to E.T.O [ a technical school in Kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because I had no one to help me [ get there ] . <EOS>
I tried all possible ways but I failed . Then I started moving around . However I thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died . <EOS>
I continued doing that and the war went on , the 1994 war . I would pass through dead bodies , people who were terribly hacked and could n't do anything for themselves . I had also been shot on the back but I would try and walk . I remember the shootings took place at seven in the evening . Later after the shooting , I tried to get out of the fence where we were but it was a problem to me as they had destroyed all the behind passages . They blocked the way out so that they could see anyone who would try to jump over the fence . They waited and realized that there was no alive , then they told each other , "@ You can now enter and start looting . @" <EOS>
I was there and they started looting while I was watching . But I was hiding in a corner of the house . After it happened , I entered in the house and got a cloth and tied it here behind because I was terribly bleeding . After tying it there , I got out . And stood there at the corner . They came and did all they did ... there are some things they did not manage to take that particular night . They came the following morning . When they came back that following morning , I had left . <EOS>
I suffered ... I went through so many problems , the roadblocks , and things of that sort . But because my [ last ] day had n't reached , nothing happened to me . Later the Inkotanyi saved me . But still , they only saved me because we met at the place where they were fighting . They used to take some people , not everyone and then they would advance . <EOS>
That is how I survived and I was taken to the hospital . I was treated because I had been injured . But they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound . In July , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating . Then F.A.R.G [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school . We started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools . <EOS>
So I managed to study but because I had a problem with my arm , which was due to the wound where I was shot at the shoulder , I was not very okay mentally . Life went on like that . They were other children who survived . We used to meet there and talk about what happened to us and to our people during the genocide . But days were very bad during that period . No one was able to ... imagine one killing a person who is not fighting back . It is a big problem ; killing someone who can never fight back , it is like killing a lamb . The killer was capable of torturing the victim as much as he wished . <EOS>
Fortunately , the war ended . Life went on as it used to be . Well , life was still very hard but peace was certain . The rest comes slowly by slowly . From then up to now life is going on fairly . Well , people get problems like health problems and others but one keeps trying to look for a living . We believe that it is God , who knows . When we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that God played his role . Because human beings would never manage it without God 's power . <EOS>
Now that you have told us about your life in details , I would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ? <EOS>
Eh , my dad was called Macumi Francois and my mum was called Umulisa Odetta . <EOS>
And how many were you in your family ? <EOS>
We were two ... three kids at home . We were all boys . They all died and I am the only one who survived . <EOS>
Among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ? <EOS>
Yes , among my brothers . <EOS>
How old are you ? <EOS>
I am twenty @-@ five years old . <EOS>
Before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ? If it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ? <EOS>
Yes it used to happen especially within families . Some people were victimized in that way . Our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were Inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift . I remember how my family was tortured and we had no security . <EOS>
My father used to work in exile ; he used to go on long trips and then Interahamwe would attack us at night ; they would bang on our door ... but we would be patient because the same people we were supposed to report to were the ones to initiate everything . I guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it . Still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ I got such and such problem . @" But since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do . <EOS>
We definitely used to get such problems . In fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . But they never did any harm to us . <EOS>
You told us some of your family members would be forced to shift . Do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ? Where did they go or where were they taken ? <EOS>
Yeah ... okay , there was ... well I can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in Gikondo and in Kinazi before . When they left Kinazi , they went to Cyangugu . They made move to Cyangugu and then they came back here in Gikondo . <EOS>
During the time when people were suspected to be traitors , there is one of my relatives who was beaten up to the extent that he died after going crazy . His name was François . He died in the genocide in Gikondo , an area where there used to be a terrible Interahammwe called ‘ Congolais ' [ Congolese ] . His mother [ François ' ] was called Nyinakazi w'Inyezi [ meaning ‘ Mother of Inyenzi ’ ] in Gikondo . The genocide found them in Gikondo . Their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work . Whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to Inyenzi . And whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from Inyenzi . They would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . One could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family . <EOS>
In brief , your family would be accused of ... <EOS>
They were accused of being Inyenzi traitors . They were again accused of having friends in exile , such things . Before 1990 , people used to come to Rwanda from exile maybe they were coming to visit their relatives . But things changed , they stopped coming . There was no more communication among people since then . <EOS>
It was well known that there was a tribal war between the Hutu and the Tutsi . And you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home . Do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a Tutsi ? <EOS>
Well , he was not harassed because he was a Tutsi but because he used to say things the way they were . Another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an Inyenzi . He was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . Then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort . The place where we lived was located in a very bad area . You have probably heard of a place called ‘ Camp Butaro ’ . All the refugees who came from Ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area . <EOS>
Could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... What was his behaviour ? The times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ? Tell us in brief how he used to handle it . <EOS>
In fact what he was accused of , he was accused ... First of all he was someone who...did not like the ideas of jealousy or of ethnic or regional segregation . Secondly , he was not afraid of saying the truth , he did not fear anyone and he could n't support anyone he would see doing something wrong . Never ! So , they thought he was against them . They would say , "@ Why is it that when we tell him our ideas he never agrees with us ? @" What made things worse is that whenever he would go away on long trips , he would bring us tapes of Inkotayi or Kayirebwe 's video tapes . So there was always a question mark . <EOS>
He was victimized because other Hutus would say , "@ This is our fellow Hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @" <EOS>
He would tell them , "@ This is not the way things should be . @" <EOS>
Could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that Habyarimana 's plane crashed ? <EOS>
I remember I was revising my lessons and my mum was cleaning up my young brother in the sitting room . My dad owned a small bar where he was sharing a drink with other people , and then we heard that Habyarimana died . I could tell that there was a change on my parents ' faces . By then we were young , and although they would not tell us exactly what was going on , I could feel the tension in my parents and in everyone who was at home . <EOS>
Yeah , that is when they said that , "@ Let 's wait and see if we will reach morning peacefully . @" All we could do was to flee . I remember my dad saying , "@ It is over now . @" They were saying we should flee to E.T.O in Kicuciro because it was the only place where people could hide ; a neighbour would n't hide you , ever . Because you knew that some could actually be the ones to kill you . People would kill in their neighbourhoods . <EOS>
The Interahamwe who would do that were always accompanied by an older person to direct them saying , "@ Go there ... @" Someone who knew the place very well . Therefore , we decided to flee but we never managed to flee in the morning . People got killed that particular night . We were hearing gunshots the whole night . And some of our neighbours had already put roadblocks on the streets near our home . That 's how they started killing people . <EOS>
Tell us in brief ... from where he said , "@ Let 's flee . @" What happened later ... if you remember the dates or if it was two or three days later ... up to his death , what happened ? <EOS>
I do n't remember the days but I know we were ... yeah , what happened in the meantime . The morning after the plane crashed , I remember he tuned in radio Muhabura to listen to news at around five in the morning . Then some man called Evode called , he was my brother 's godfather . As they were talking he told my father how things were , he said we had no way to flee before it 's too late . Secondly , he said that those who could have helped us were too far . There was no way we would walk up to C.N.D ; it was impossible . <EOS>
He tried making phone calls ... people who were outside the country would call him asking about the situation in Kigali . They would say ; "@ we have heard that Habyarimana 's plane was crashed , how are things there ? @" We were waiting to see what would happen because they had forbidden people to go out of their homes . Nobody was allowed to go out of his or her house . But the wise men had already sensed what was going to happen next . <EOS>
Meanwhile he received several phone calls from inside and outside the country , people were asking him how the situation was . He would tell them , "@ I am at home with my family but we do n't have a way out . People are being killed in front of my house , things are horrible here . @" <EOS>
A certain neighbour whose wife was my mom 's sister . His wife was pregnant ; she was carrying twins . He had several other brothers . They were all together in the same house . Then my dad told him , "@ Instead of ... there is no way you will hide your wife , you 'd better bring her to my home and leave her there . Then the rest , everyone should find his own way . Whoever will survive will tell the story . @" That is what happened , they brought he home and others started fleeing in different directions . As people would keep on coming to hide at home , the Interahamwe would also plan how to attack us . <EOS>
Although they were making plans , they were also afraid that my dad would fight them . Indeed he tried though he failed ; they were very many . They first shot our gate ; it was a very big gate , they shot with so many bullets and it never fell down . They fought to open the different gates around the fence for two days in vain . It was one day in the evening when they finally decided to climb up the fence and get inside the compound . <EOS>
For two weeks things were still the same ; phone calls time after time ... in that area where we were living , others had already fled . People 's houses were being burnt and people were being killed . Generally there was no place to hide . Two weeks later ... they came to kill us ... on a Friday at around 6:00 p.m. I do n't remember well the dates but I am sure two weeks had passed . <EOS>
That evening they entered our home . They jumped the gate and shot the front door and it opened . Then they all entered inside the gate but we had locked ourselves inside the house . They ordered to open the door but my dad said , "@ Whether I open or not will n't make any difference , they will still shoot the doors and open them by force . @" <EOS>
Therefore , he went outside and tried to fight the men who were in front of the house but he did not succeed , instead he was shot and he immediately feel down . Then other militias entered in the house and ordered everybody to get out . Everyone got out ; it was a very long line of people . What I heard at last was people making noise . After that I saw people holding clubs and smashing other people . They were of different types ; some were shooting and others would finish up using clubs and machetes ... <EOS>
You did not clearly explain about that long line of people , where was that line coming from ? Was it the people who had hid there ... ? <EOS>
That line of people ... it was the people who were inside the house and the ones inside the compound . They had sought refuge at home . My dad would call people and tell them that in case things got worse where they were , some should come to his house while others flee to other areas . He would warn them from fleeing in a big group saying that , in case they ambushed them , they would die in a big number . "@ Send me the ones I can hide and tell the strong boys and girls to flee in separate directions . Do n't let them flee in a big number . @" He would tell them . <EOS>
He never thought that such a thing would happen . Mostly , he felt pity for the children and the women who were n't able to run . He thought such people would easily be killed . At least a man is capable of fighting or running . Even if they are shot while trying to run they can keep on running only if they are not fleeing with the rest of their family . <EOS>
They got us out of the house . We were very many forming a rank and they took us outside . They would shoot every person to get out , I was the fifth person to be shot . <EOS>
After shooting me ... they shot me while I was trying to escape ; I was sitting somewhere where there was a drum supported by stones . Around there , there was a small door , which they [ militias ] had shot and it was open ... the militias entered in a big number and I could see that no one was standing at the door . As I was trying to stand up , he shot me here [ he shows ] and I fell down . When I fell down , maybe he thought I was dead . He skipped me and shot those who were around me . <EOS>
At the end one of them said , "@ This is not enough , open a grenade . @" They opened one . I even still have its scars somewhere here ; I have two fragments inside ere . As they threw the grenade , I was also hurt but it just felt like an injection so I ignored it . I thought in case I breathed , they would hear me . <EOS>
Therefore , I remained in the floods of blood and kept quiet . My shirt was full of blood and everyone who was lying on top of me had blood all over . I just kept quiet . And then they threw another grenade and some of them walked over people 's bodies stabbing them with knives . I did n't notice one who wanted to stab me . Fortunately he missed and hit the ground on the grass instead . I sensed that it was me he wanted to stab . He again raised up the knife and stabbed me on the shoulder . When he saw me bleeding , he thought we were all dead . <EOS>
Therefore , they left . I was watching them as they were leaving . I rose up my head a bit but everybody was silent ; they were all dead . I stood up ... One thing I remember is the way I entered the house and picked up the blanket ; it was raining and the blanket was very big . Therefore , I covered them and covered myself with a loincloth , which belonged to my mum . <EOS>
I had lost my mind ; I would wonder if I should get into the house and sleep . I was confused . Sometimes people cry but I did n't have tears to cry , not even a drop . Instead I would think about what had happened to me and I 'd suddenly feel so confused . <EOS>
While I was still there , they jumped back the fence and got in . I had left my shirt there ... it was even becoming dark . They shot many bullets to the extent that some of the neighbours fled and others thought it was a contest between the Inkotayi and the Interahamwe . The majority were informed about what it was the following day . Several people came to watch us ; others were looting our properties . That was when I left the place . After fleeing I ... meanwhile during all those days genocide was worsening . That is what I saw in the meantime . <EOS>
Do you know how your family members died ... ? I mean your brothers and sisters and your mum . You told us that your dad was shot ... <EOS>
Yes ... my mum was also shot . She was a "@ born again Christian . @" She liked praying so much ; all I would hear her say was , "@ Jesus Christ @"@ . And my brothers were next to each other ; they were made to sit in a line like this ... I heard people screaming besides . I remember my aunt ... there was no other way but if I had had help , she would have survived . She died in the banana plantation but I too was helpless , I could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant . For her she still had some strength to breathe . <EOS>
There was nothing I could do for her , myself I had lost conscience due to what had happened to me . I left her after she had breathed her last breath . By the time I left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead . They shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here . My brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head . There was a big stream of blood . <EOS>
But when you left , you never got a chance to know that ... <EOS>
I never got another chance to know what happened next . I came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up . And I found only corpses lying in the compound . I tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide . They helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ... <EOS>
By that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ? <EOS>
By that time , I could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing . I could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing . Things like that . <EOS>
Were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ? <EOS>
I was n't able to do that . You see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal . We did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony . We just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil . Then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else . <EOS>
Would you please tell us in brief how your life was , from the time you left your home to the time the Inkotanyi captured the country . What was your life like ... tell us in brief how you were living ? <EOS>
Generally , during the genocide , I suffered a lot because I got many problems yet ... <EOS>
From the time you left your home . <EOS>
When I left home I continued to walk . But even as I was going , there were some people who were behind me . They tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving Kicuciro for Gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there . Therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me . They found out that I never went there . <EOS>
After the struggle , that is after meeting the Inkotanyi I told them [ Inkotanyi ] all I went through and where I had been . They helped me as much as they could . They asked me , "@ how are you ? @" I told them that my problem was the injury I had . They could see it had rotten because I never used to get treatment . They treated me and later asked me to go home and start looking for a living . My current life ... well I can not say that it is very good but still I can not say that it is too bad . When there is peace in the country and one is able to sleep peacefully , then life goes on . <EOS>
After you met the Inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ? Whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ? <EOS>
What happened later after they left me , I went to Kicuciro . There is someone from my family who had survived but I never knew ... when the war began , I guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them . Therefore , I thought they had all died . I went to Remera near IAMCA , where KIE [ Kigali Institute of Education ] presently is . <EOS>
Then I met a certain man who had come from Uganda ; he knew my family . He took me to school in Uganda . I studied there for a while and came back to Rwanda . I registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . That is how things used to be . I would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on . <EOS>
I finally got used to it and started living a normal life . I would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened . One can never forget what happened but life has to go on . <EOS>
Did you manage to finish school ? <EOS>
Well ... I did not finish school but I reached a certain level where I am able to look for a living . But I wish to go back to school though I still have some problems . <EOS>
What was bothering you while you were at school ? <EOS>
I used to have a problem of headaches . I would be attentive in class but all of a sudden I would get terrible headaches . Another problem was due to my arm ; it would hurt me so much and I would n't ... <EOS>
You said you suffered a lot . But you never explained very well to us how you suffered . <EOS>
Eh ... the way I suffered ... <EOS>
What happened in your life in general ? Not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now . What has been the most challenging thing ? <EOS>
Loosing both my parents ? Well ... first of all I started another kind of life , which I was n't used to . Because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living . I entered another life that I was not used to . <EOS>
Living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something I needed . Those are the things that would disturb me . The fact that ... those are things I noticed . The way I saw people dying and the way I was skipping corpses , people I would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me . Until when I met the Inkotanyi . <EOS>
I remember there was a man who lived here and we met at Sainte Famille . He assured me that he was going to save me . But we reached somewhere and I noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . I escaped him and run away ; I escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where I went . <EOS>
I saw different things in life . I saw people suffer . I saw how after the genocide orphans got problems , I included . I got used to a different life style . God helped me now I am used to the new life style . There is a saying that , "@ Akabi ntikamenyerwa nk'akeza . @" It means it is more difficult to get used to bad things than to good things . But later you get used due to the situation . Yeah ... <EOS>
I also know how difficult life for orphans . But what can you do to solve some of your problems ? <EOS>
What I would do , I would go to some place where I would keep myself busy especially to my former house . I thank God that I did n't rent a house . And as far as school fees were concerned , I would n't bother much because the funds [ F.A.R.G , Fond d' Assistance aux Rescapés du Génocide ] would help us . We appreciate their help for our school fees because we would go to school saying , "@ Let 's study maybe tomorrow we will be able to improve our lives . @" <EOS>
Life went on like that ... I would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could . Until I got totally used to it and I grew older , which made me so happy . <EOS>
In your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ? Something that takes away your joy . What hurts you most whenever you remember it ? <EOS>
Living without my relatives ... no family , which is the most important thing ... living without anybody to tell my problems . Sometimes I say , "@ I could get this or that in such a way , but since there is nobody to help me , what can I do ? @" Then I remember that , I could have been with my parents or relatives and they could have helped me in such a time . <EOS>
However , it does n't discourage me . Secondly I am hurt by the kind of life orphans lead yet they were n't meant to live that way . Especially when they are three or four orphans who can not help one another . It is a pity . <EOS>
Well ... even if you are an orphan , life has to go on whatever the case may be ... <EOS>
Yes , that is true life has to go on . And it is still going on . <EOS>
What advise can you give someone like you who passed through such hardships and who experienced a hard life ? Those who lead a life like yours ? <EOS>
The advice I can give them ... first of all I would encourage them to have morale . They should know that in life such things ... well , such things happened because people had become wild due to bad governance . Another advice I can give them is to use their time efficiently . If one has a chance to go to school , he or she should study . If one gets a job then he or she should work . Or if there is someone who has a farm with destroyed houses , he or she should try to build there his or her own house and put there his or her own family when they get an opportunity to do so . Any one who has a chance should use it well . That is the advice I can give them . <EOS>
Something else I would like to ask you is about those who did those things [ those who killed ] . What message do you have for them ? <EOS>
The message I can give them ... well they should first admit their crimes . After they have admitted that they killed , the next step would be easy . Because if you deny that you killed yet they are witnesses who accuse you to have killed , I believe it is better to accept that you committed the crime . <EOS>
If you admit that you committed a crime then your punishment would be reduced or ... whatever the case , the truth would be revealed . Maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't . But they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood . After they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier . But since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... I think they should just acknoweldge what they did . <EOS>
What message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ? <EOS>
The message I would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading . There are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh ! But the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully . <EOS>
The only advice I could give such a person is to kind of overlook what happened and go on with life . He or she should look for a living . He or she will later find out that everything is possible . However , such a person will never forget what happened , that is impossible . But he or she should just find a way to ignore it and look for a living because that is how life is . Because even those who were killing us never knew that we would survive . To them , the fact that we survived is unbelievable ; imagine killing about a hundred people from the same family and one survives . They never knew it was possible but God proved to them that everything is possible . Umh ... <EOS>
What do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ? <EOS>
I appreciate that ceremony and I find it very good . There is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten . That is impossible . It is a good ceremony because ... whenever that period comes , people always say , "@ At such a time , disasters occurred in this country due to this or that reason . @" That act of commemoration for those who died in the genocide ... constitutes an example to other nations...it gives an example to other countries and they get a chance to judge that what happened to our country was terribly wrong and should never happen again . I find that ceremony very important because it helps people to predict our country 's future and it helps us to avoid its reoccurring . <EOS>
Today you are leading a life that is different from the one you would be living if your parents were still alive . You certainly desire a better life . Whom do you think should play a role in improving your life and for you to get peace at heart ? <EOS>
Saying that one has a role to play in it ... F.A.R.G tries its best to help some of us . The fund tries to advice those who are leading a difficult life about how they should behave in such a situation . I believe in life it ’ [ s important to ... Not that we should wish for things we will never get or let someone make promises they will never fulfill ... <EOS>
That is not possible . What matters is that you have a place where to relax or a place where you can host a visitor or a place where to throw parties and host friends because you consider the friends that survived as your family . Of course I am talking about real friends ; they are the closest relatives one is left with . You visit each other and live in a sort of community so that you do n't feel deserted . When people visit you , you chat and when there is an idea to analyze , you do it together and you are happy . If you are working on a project or studying then you do it together . Such things contribute to our own development . I guess that the best thing to do . <EOS>
What do you think you ... [ bad sound ] <EOS>
I believe reconciling all Rwandans would be a very big step forward . When you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts . It is time for every Rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country . They should love each other as Rwandans . Rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country . Conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation . <EOS>
There is no interest in conflicts . Instead , I believe reconciliation based on principles for developing the country would be a big step forward for a better life . I believe they should first understand clearly how important reconciliation is and what an important step it is . <EOS>
In your opinion , do you find it possible for Rwandans to reconcile ? And if it is impossible why is that ? <EOS>
In my opinion , reconciliation among Rwandans ... well , it is possible but it will be a long process . But in the end it will happen . It is even taking place nowadays . Today people do interact yet they belong to different ethnic groups . They talk with no problem . They visit each other . And when it 's time to share , they share . <EOS>
But it is possible it is on its way ... And personally , I think those who do n't want to move forward and make that step are fools . Because there is no way one will live alone in this world ; there is no way one can decide to live with only one ethnic group . It is impossible . <EOS>
If you feel like living with only one group of people , then even governing this country will become a problem . That means that all Rwandans would n't be able to live with each other . It would be like going back to the time of conflicts when people would kill others without any reason or because of what you own or because of your ethnic group . It was said that due to your ethnic group , you were not allowed to pass in school . To me , that is nonsense . It can not contribute to the development of the country . <EOS>
Some people would always put forward the issue of ethnicity . I have just understood that your parents were from different ethnics groups . How do you feel about it ? <EOS>
To me I do n't feel anything ... saying that so and so is from this or that ethnic group ... even the genocidaires killed some people who did not belong to the ethnic group that was hunted . They were victimized because they had positive ideas and they did n't believe they should hack the mother of their children just because she is of a different ethnic group . Some did it in the name of taking up a challenge . They would say , "@ so and so has killed somebody 's family , therefore I also have to kill a certain family . @" Just because somebody killed they also had to kill , which is so stupid . <EOS>
Actually , it can never ... it does n't constitute a factor of development . Some people say , mostly the survivors , "@ The Hutu exterminated my family . @" Umh ? He or she has no family left , not a single relative and he or she believes a certain ethnic group killed his or her people . In order for such a person to forget and start thinking differently , important lessons need to be taught . Otherwise , the country will move forward and he or she will be left behind . <EOS>
Such a person will live a lonely life , in anxiety . At the end of the day , all this does not really matter . The best thing I would advice such a person is to concentrate on life ... to look for a way to improve his or her life . They should say , "@ Since this happened , let me be the first one to fight against it . I saw this with my own eyes . I saw how someone from one ethnic group hacked someone else from another ethnic group or someone who did not share their political beliefs . @" Therefore , I believe the best thing is to first of all get it out of one 's mind , to forget it . Well , there is a way you can forget something in the head but it is still in your heart . And there is also a way one can completely forget ; truly believing that to keep on remembering is a waste of time . <EOS>
You just mentioned survivors who say that , "@ Hutu killed my people . @" Do you personally believe it were the Hutu who did you wrong or do you believe it were the Tutsi ? Which of both sides do you blame ? <EOS>
I believe it was the Hutu who did me wrong because no Tutsi would have come to kill me . First of all , there was no way Tutsi would come to kill me since we had no problems with each other . Secondly there was no way they would find the courage to kill us yet they were also hunted . I guess you understand that they had no possibility of killing me . But since the Hutus had the power and the ability to do anything they wanted , they are the ones who killed . <EOS>
There is a certain program for Gacaca courts , which is meant for punishing the criminals . What can you say about it ? In the name of revealing the truth about the genocide and bringing reconciliation among Rwandans , what is your view about Gacaca courts or how do you understand it ? What do you think about it ? <EOS>
The way I consider the issue of Gacaca ... well , something I always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to Arusha . It was important to let the other perpetrators be judgeded from their local courts where the local people have access . Because ... for example if someone killed in Gikondo or Remera and he is imprisoned in Muhima ; there is no way someone from Muhima would accuse him without knowing him . <EOS>
Therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted . I believe it was a very good idea . Because if they had not simplified it in that way , maybe it would be more difficult to judge them . But when they take the prisoners in their respective provinces , communes and cells , it facilitates the judges who examine their cases . And it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts . <EOS>
There is no way you can witness someone whose trials are taking place in Nyamirambo when you are from Gikongoro . It is hard to get means of transport or accommodation ... I guess the idea was good . So that the defendant are judged and punished for their crimes . <EOS>
It is unbelievable that a neighbour could actually have the courage to kill his or her neighbour ... That someone would come to your place and kill your whole family when you used to go to the same school with his children or when your families intermarried , or when they used to pay you a visit when you threw parties at home . I believe Gacaca is very good idea . <EOS>
What do you think of the program of getting prisoners to say the truth about people 's death and ask for forgiveness ? <EOS>
Yes ... that is very good because before I forgive you , you first need to come to me and tell me ... "@ Deep in my heart I feel guilty . I did this or that to so and so and the best witness is my conscience . @" If your conscience accuses you of what you did , then ask for forgiveness . It is true that those you offended can only forgive you and it still does n't clear away the crime you committed . But if you just admit it , it brings about some change as it lightens the burden they were carrying . <EOS>
This testimony we are getting from you is going to be kept in a special way . People may see it after ... when you are very old . Even your kids may see it or your grandchildren because it will be kept in the safest possible way . What message can you give to people in general , but more specifically to your future children , in relation to what happened . <EOS>
What I can begin with is ... the message I 'd like to give is @: when we were young , we used to talk to our grandfathers and they would tell us about the 1959 war , the 1962 war and what took place there . Now in our case ... the 1994 war particularly terrible . People were killed in an extremely horrible way . I used to hear that in the past they would kill women and children ... I am not sure but it was something like that . But this time the whole family with its offsprings would be killed and completely finished ... such things ... <EOS>
It seems like what happened will never be forgotten . Because even my children will one day ask me , "@ Dad where is our grandfather or our grandmother ? @" In that case what I would tell them is "@ your grandparents died at this period , when conflicts rose in the country and some people hated others based on their ethnic belonging or on their honesty about their [ political ] opinion . Others were victimized because of their families ... It went to an extent of families killing each other because of grudges already existing within them . <EOS>
I would explain to him how things were , how people hated each other in 1994 . I would tell him how they killed his relatives simply because of their ethnic belonging or to their honesty about their [ political ] opinion . Then I would advise him not to ever follow such ideologies especially when based on people 's ethnic groups and never to give importance to such ideas . That is the first thing I would warn him about . I would explain to him that the reason he does n't have grandparents , is because of the hatred somepeople developed towards others . I would tell him how there once were conflicts between two ethnic groups and as a result , people hated one another and killed each other . <EOS>
I would want to try and teach him the truth . So that he may never be affected in his life as grown up . I would encourage him never to believe in such ideas . I would tell him that his grandparents were killed either because of the ethnic group they belonged to or because they were supporting a certain ethnic group . I would tell him so that he grows up knowing what happened . And the point would be to avoid him wasting his time doing the same thing . <EOS>
In the past while you were still with your parents , you saw the government , the political parties and the development that were in the country then . What do you think is the future of this country when you consider its past ? <EOS>
Our country 's future ... well the first thing I am thankful for is the government of unity ; it is trying to bring back Rwandans into transparency . They also try to find a way of punishing those Interahamwe who did those things [ killed ] so that it all comes in the open ... in the future there would be no more bad spirit among Rwandans . Things like hacking one another or killing one another . <EOS>
Therefore , I believe the government played a great role and now the country is developing ; new houses are being built , there is a change in the governance . Generally , things are changing for the better . According to me , as years go by , the country will farther develop . <EOS>
Is there anything you would like to add on the testimony that you are giving us ? It could be a message or anything you would wish to say as a conclusion . <EOS>
The additional information to what I said is ... I would like to thank so much all the people who are looking after the Rwandan orphans . Especially Rwandans who understood how needy those orphans are . All those who give out a hundred francs of fifty or anything ... be it an advice ... I believe so many orphans go to school ; others try to look for a living . Personally this messes me . Another thing I would like to talk about is the way things are changing as time goes by . Many good things are happening , the way people interact with each other , the country 's security , which is very good . <EOS>
Anything else you would like to add ? <EOS>
I think that is all . <EOS>
