When we arrived there, they were very many peole; the natives but the majority were the Tutsis who at the same time faced problems. This place is called Nyakabanda cell and before, it was known to be part of Kanombe district but after 1990 when the war started it was made to be part of Kicuciro district up to now.</s></text>

I will tell you old the events, which took place in the last week or I will begin from the death of Gatabazi and Bucyana, who was a CDR member. That is when we started getting many problems. That is when many people (the Tutsi) were killed. They used to get young boys who would be going to their homes and take their clothes off and force them to wear combat and Boots. They would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them Inkotanyi, yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well.</s></text>

A certain old man called Théodore Bizimana decided to shift; he fled and left this place because of the smeil of corpses, which they used to dump in front of his home every morning. During that time, they used to enter people's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted: either at night or daytime. They could take any thing they wished from people's houses and beat anyone they wanted to beat. I remember sometime, it was on the Hory Thursday towards Esther. I was going to church and as I reached just in front, I saw a certain boy who was caught by the presidential guards. It was close to the home of Nsabimana's sister, this Nsabimana was a soldier and he had another name; he was called Castar.</s></text>

Then she told me while she was pulling my arm, "let's procced, it is the Interahamwe (militias) killing the other Tutsi." Then I asked her "what did he do?" "He is accused of being a Tutsi and stop talking about it, otherwise they will kill you too." I procceded but I was very frightened. However, as I reached at the corner I saw soldiers. I told them that there was somebody who was being killed. But when they realized that he had a Tutsi appearance, they replied to me in French because I had talked to them in French, so they said, "laisse- le, lui il a le droit de mourrir." Meaning, "leave him, he has right to die." that is what that man told me. So I procceded.</s></text>

They cut it in order to stop us from communicating with embassies because they knew that some how we must be in tough with a certain embassy; therefore, they knew we could call the embassy and tell them the situation around our area. Therefore, they cut the cabble that used to supply up to this place. Frankly speaking, I cannot clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time, there were no electric phones. At least they would have disconnected the communication system and leave the electricity. Then in the morning we heard that the president died. We got the rumours from the neighbours because we couldn't listen to the radio because we had no electricity. They had started burning people's houses and killing people.</s></text>

In stead you attack this poor widow 'Claudette' and menace her." They could never let her sleep for a minute. Everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish. When the genocide begun, she was killed first in our area. And then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called Modeste (I don't remember his other name) to go and face Aloys about that issue.

My husband started shifting people; he had a track, so he would shift people at night. At night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas.

        <text langid="eng"><s>After some time we wanted to exhume their remains for proper reburial. After reconstructing our house, we asked the ministry of social affairs to help us in the act of exhuming and reburying those remains of people. However, they seemed not to consider that as an agent issue yet we couldn't continue living in someone's house. A certain relative had sheltered us but we didn't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house. We came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there. We would consol on ourselves that, "after all they are our people, we can live in the house while they are still there. There is no problem." We started living in our house and four years later... in 1998 that is when in the name Kicuciro district there was a decision to exhume and rebury all the remains of people who lived in this area. Then, they came to our home too. We first found about four skulls but when we scooped deeper, more fifty-nine bodies were found, which still had fresh. And, one could easily identify that woman who was pregnant; she still had braids and nails. She even had fresh and one could see that she was pregnant although her belly was deformed. We found children's remains inside, men and women. One could tell women from their hair; they still had hair.</s></text>

        <text langid="eng"><s>However, we couldn't tell who was who; most people from this area, who lost their beloved ones, came here to see if they would find them. The worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people's death couldn't tell us the names of people who died there. Among them, they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas. However, the people who witnessed them the day they were killed couldn't tell us who they were. We even tried to contact my neighbour (our houses are next to each other) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim's remains. He stood in his home and could peep through his fencing; he didn't want to come here. It is hard to know the people who died here. Up to now he cannot tell you the truth; he says that he saw the Interahawe so and so passing by. People's remains are everywhere; just in front here, there are remains, even in our gardens they are others. There is a time we wanted to dig in our garden but as one would dig in the soil, could fine a skull. In fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here.</s></text>
