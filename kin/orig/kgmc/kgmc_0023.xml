        <text langid="eng"><s>Yes, I asked them what is going on. They said that Tutsis have been attacked, how have they been attacked? It is happening again! Since I was a child they were burning Tutsi belongings, chasing them away and now it has happened again? So I said: 'that is how it is.' And then I told the others, 'listen to me kids. The war has begun and you all should go home. I don't want to die with you' Then I sent some of the kids at home. That night passed and on the following day, I saw them taking a young boy... they came to me and said: 'there is where...' they sent student's books... when he came home from school with many books brought by a boy of about his same age. I kept the books and after keeping them I saw someone called Wellars coming. I took him in the house and asked him where he had been then he said that he was from Kigali. I asked him: 'When did you arrive? Habyarimana died yesterday but one...when did you come?' he said, 'I came yesterday'. I put him into the house and locked the door. Many more people came in the house and among them were girls. I said to myself: 'If I put these girls and the men together and that they get discovered, they will tell everything they know. Girls are not good at talking.' Then I made some traditional medicine and gave to one of them and told her to drink and smeared the other with it. Stayed with one of them and I told the rest to go home.</s></text>

I remained with the other one tied her to my clothes like this, we walked around together when I went out of the house there she was with me and thought to myself there is nowhere I am going to reach with these children with this young girl, and they said that we will get her from you when I went to fetch water they would say that we will get her from you and I said that you won't get her! Why get her from me she is a Hutu do you think she is a Tutsi? When I went to fetch water I found corpse all round, I said this is a tragedy in my home so they came closer and closer and I asked them what is this that you are doing? They said that if I say what I had seen they would kill me on my way to the market. On my way to the market they surrounded me but I had drunk my medicine and I had some in my hands. I told them, you are lying and they said, is it a surprise? Presidential guards who had come from Kigali came I got some fuel from them and I said that if anyone ever came to get anyone in my house I will burn them. Just like they would burn me. They threatened to kill me, they said that since that old woman likes Tutsis we will kill her, we don't know her back ground and neither do we talk to her.</s></text>

I thought of hiding him and I  looked for trees and dug this hole four meters deep five meter wide, and I dragged the ground like this and then I took off the ceiling of the house and I took it to the hole and covered it. I added more dust to an extent that rain couldn't penetrate through. I went and brought him. He gave me another man from Ntogwe called Emmanuel Twagirayezu, and he told to come back and tell him. After some time when I went back I found more people that had come among them was the daughter to Kabiligi, Ancila, she knew me we had been together in school. She asked me to take her with me, she had two children and one of her late sister. I brought them and put them in there to now there were five of them, a man named Bugene from over there, he could always come to see me with the Interahamwe and they didn't recognize any thing, they came and searched my house nothing was in it.
