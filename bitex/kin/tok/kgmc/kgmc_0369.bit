Ubundi njyewe nitwa Nzaramba Justin mfite imyaka mirongo itanu n' ibiri ( 52 ) , mfite umugore n' abana , ntuye hano muri aka kagali ka Byimana . Tukaba nkaba ndi hano mu Rubirizi ahantu haguye inzirakarengane muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 1994 ) , hakaba hari ukuntu rero aho hantu hari amateka maremare , aho hantu ni ahantu hananiranye gushyingura abantu bahaguye mu ntambara yo muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 1994 ) ariko haguyemo abantu batagira ingano haguyemo abantu benshi . Abantu bava ku mirenge itandukanye Kicukiro , Kagarama , umurenge wa Kanombe , ndetse n' utugari bita Kabeza ndetse na Samuduha . Ubwo rero aha hantu umwaka waba ushize nkuko abantu bagomba gushyingurwa bazize itsembabwoko , aha hantu haratunaniye uru rwobo rwaratunaniye , twafatanyije n' abaturage ba Kicukiro , na Kanombe , na Samuduha , na Kagarama turagerageza birananirana . ||| We are here at the Rubirizi diary , Byimana cell , Niboye sector in Kicukiro district . My name is Justin Nzaramba and I am 52 years old . I am married and I have children . I live here in Byimana . I am here at Rubirizi , a site of the killing of innocent people in 1994 . This place has a long story . It still has n't been possible to bury the victims who were killed during the 1994 war . In fact , thousands of people were killed here . The victims were from different districts such as Kicukiro , Kanombe , sectors such as Kagarama , Kabeza , Samuduha...It 's been a year that the remains of these victims are supposed to have been buried but we have n't been able to do anything because of this pit . We tried with the people of Kicukiro , Kanombe , Kagarama , Kabeza , Samuduha...but were unable to .
Kuko aha hantu haguye abantu barenga ibihumbi barenga nk' ibihumbi nka bitatu , mwambaza ngo bavaga hehe ? N' abantu babaga barahunze , barahunze ingo zabo babasangamo bakabica , abandi bakabavumbura mu bihuru ahongaho muri ferme ya Rubirizi dore ko hari inka nyinshi hari n' ibihuru . Bakaza bakabicira ahangaha , abandi ba kabiri babavanaga iwabo mu ngo babavanaga ku mugabo wari umukonseye witwaga Biziyaremye niko amakuru ampa barabazanaga bakabafata mu modoka muri za kamyoneti , bakaza bakabashyira interahamwe mu Rubirizi bakabica bakabanaga mu cyobo muri iki cyobo . Ni kirekire cyane iki bari baragiteganyirije gushyiramo inka zapfuye , ni kirekire cyane ku buryo gifite nka metero nka mirongo ine ( 40 m ) z' ubujyakuzimu , ku buryo ntago ari bantu bagicukuye bwa buryo busanzwe , ni ikintu kirekire cyane ku buryo byarananiranye kugira ngo bakivanemo abo bantu . Twaragerageje rero twagerageje kugicukura ariko bavuga ko bamennyemo za acide , bamennyemo harimo inka nyinshi , mbega ku buryo ministere yatubwiye y' uko ubwo cyananiranye tuzahashyira urwibutso , tuzacyubakira tukazacyibukiraho , tukajya tuza kuhibukira hafi buri mwaka ariko hakoze neza . ||| Over 3,000 people lost their lives here . Maybe you will ask @: where did these people come from ? They were people who fled from their homes , some were killed in their homes . Others were found out in the bush near the Rubirizi farm [ there were many cows and a very wide bush ] and then the killers used to bring them here to kill them . They also brought some from the house of the then counselor named Biziyaremye , after the latter had kidnapped them from their homes . Those are the news that ... the victims were transported in pick ups and taken to the Interahamwes who were at Rubirizi . They used to throw people into a big pit after killing them . This pit is very deep . It was dug in order for dead cows to be thrown there . It is about 40 meters long and it was n't dug the usual way . It is so deep that it has n't possible to exhume the bodies of the victims that are inside . We tried digging but we were told they poured acid into it . There are even remains of cows inside ! We tried in vain and the ministry told us we shall build a memorial site there . That way , we will be able to visit the place every year after it 's been built .
Hari umugabo witwa Rurangirwa Damascène ku buryo n' ababyeyi be bose ariho babashyize , yari yaragerageje ku gisukura neza kugikora neza ngo bazajye bacyubaha kuko yabonaga nta bundi buryo buhari bwo kuvanamo abo bantu , ahitamo kuki betona ariko nyuma ministère idutije imashini bafatanyije n' akarere ka Kicukiro na Kanombe baragerageza bageze nko muri metero umunani birananirana . Ku buryo harimo za gaz n' ibindi bintu n' inka bari baranazemo , icyakora twabashije kubonamo abantu nka batandatu gusa amagufwa yabo bagiye kuyashyingura hamwe n' abandi . ||| Damascène Rurangirwa is a man whose parents had been thrown into this pit . He had tried to make it look better so people can show a bit of respect towards the place . He had realized that there was no other way of exhuming the corpses . He got it concreted . Later on , the ministry lent us a machine and people from Kicukiro and Kanombe dug it up , but they were unable to go over 8 meters because of the gas and the cows remnant ... They were at least able to exhume the remains of 8 people that they buried in respect with other bones .
Abantu bicirwaga hano bicwaga mu buhe buryo ? Barabarasaga ? babazanaga ari bazima bakabanagamo ? ||| How were these people killed ? Were they shot dead ? Did the perpetrators throw them alive into the pit ?
Abantu babazanaga ari bazima bakabicira uruhande rw' uru rwobo hanyuma bakabanagamo , harimo n' abo banazemo ari bazima , njyewe nzi nka mukuru wanjye bamunazemo ari muzima yamazemo iminsi nk' ibiri arimo kuvuga ngo bamuhe amazi ngo bamuhe amazi , bamaze kumuca akaboko bamunagamo ari muzima baramubwira ngo niyihambe . ||| The perpetrators brought them alive to the pit , killed them and then threw them in . Some were even thrown in alive ! For example , my older brother was thrown in alive . He spent 2 days agonizing and begging for drinking water ! The perpetrators cut up his arm and threw him in mocking him and saying he should bury himself .
Abandi bararaswaga ? Bicishwaga amahiri ? ||| What about the others ? Did they shoot them or did they use clubs to kill them ?
Hano akenshi n' imipanga , n' imipanga cyane cyane haraswaga nk' uwageragezaga wenda kwiruka , ariko n' imipanga ahanini n' impiri abandi bakabanagamo ari bazima hano bapfuye urupfu rubi cyane . Ariko ntago ari aha honyine hari n' ibindi byobo barimo ariko uru nirwo barwitaga urwabayanga , kubera ko ni ahantu bashyiragamo inka nyinshi cyane kandi murabona ko inka z' ahangaha zari inzungu zari inka ziriya za kijyambere , ku buryo zananiranye hano harimo abantu benshi cyane . ||| Here , most of the people were killed with machetes . Only those who tried escaping were shot . The rest were killed with machetes and clubs or even thrown into the pit alive ! People were subjected to horrible deaths here and it was n't just here because there were other pits . This pit was called ‘ Urwabayanga ’ and many cows were thrown in . I believe you saw the cows that were here . They are from a very productive race ... we were n't able to do anything about it ! There are many people here .
Ugereranyije haba haratawemo nk' abantu bangana iki ? ||| About how many people were thrown in here ?
Bararenga ni nk' ibihumbi nka bibiri , kuko abantu bari batuye kuri uyu musozi nta numwe wagarutse kandi abenshi bazaga bahungira ahangaha kugirango bari bazi yuko ahangaha ari mu bihuru bari baziko bashobora kubona bamwe ariko abandi bagakira , n' abantu bari nk' ibihumbi nka bitatu . Bamwe bari baragiye za Gahanga barongera barabagarura abandi bavaga ku giporoso abandi bavaga za Kicukiro abandi bava hariya za Samuduha , ubwo rero babahigishaga n' imbwa n' ibiki byose . ||| Over 2,000 people . I am saying this because none of the people on this hill came back . In addition , most of people sought refuge in that bush hoping that some of them would survive . There were 5,000 more people who had fled towards Gahanga but they were forced to turn back . There were other ones who were coming from Giporoso , Kicukiro , Samuduha ... the killers were tracking them down as though they were dogs .
Ibyo bikorwa byo gutamo abantu hano byaba byaratangiye ryari Habyarimana akimara gupfa cyangwa ? ||| When did it all start ? Was it after Habyarimana 's death ?
Akimara gupfa iryo joro , ku buryo bamwe bari bamaze n' iminsi bahungiye muri Eto , byari byaratangiye kera abantu bari baratangiye guhunga mbere mu byo mu kwezi kwa gatatu 94 . Abantu bamwe bari barahungiye ku ma paruwasi , kuva ku itariki ya karindwi nibwo abantu batangiye guhungira muri Eto , ariko muri Eto abashoboye kuva muri Eto bageze i Nyanza nabo barabica , harokotse bake cyane kandi muri Eto harimo abantu bageze nko ku bihumbi nka bitanu . Aba ni abashoboye kuva muri iyi misozi bajya za Gahanga barongera nanone bamwe barabica abandi baragaruka , baziko bagarutse babatangirira ahangaha , babatangirira ahangaha bose interahamwe zari ziri kuri iriya misozi yose zabazengurutse . ||| The night he died . There were people who had already sought refuge at ETO @-@ Kicukiro . It had started way before ! People had been displaced since March 1994 . Then , they 'd sought refuge in parishes . It 's only from the 7th of April that they fled to ETO . The ones who were lucky to survive the atrocities at ETO went to Nyanza . When they got to Nyanza , they were killed . Very few survived . There were about 5,000 people at ETO . The ones you see are those who were hiding in the hills of Gahanga . Some were killed and others came back . When the Interahamwes got to know that these people were going to come back here , they trapped them . It was all the Interahamwes from all the hills around here .
Ibyaribyo byose nk' umuntu utuye muri aka kagali ka Byimana , kandi ukaba uri umwe mubaba bararokotse ngira ngo ufite icyo uzi ku bantu batagamo abantu ahangaha , sinzi niba watubwira mu magambo makeya kubyerekeye abo bantu ? ||| I believe that as a survivor and as somebody who lives in this cell of Byimana , you know something about the people who were dumping people into the pits . I 'd like you to tell us about them if possible .
Inaha hari interahamwe zizwi cyane , hari interahamwe hari uwo bitaga Gerard Karanganwa , hari abo bitaga ba Kabagabo , hari abo bitaga ba Bizimungu , hari abo bitaga ba Idi , hari abo bitaga ba Kagarara . Mbega hano hari interahamwe nyinshi cyane , inyinshi ntago zagarutse , abenshi ntibagarutse ndacyeka bacyiri muri Congo . Abo bose barababuze , ariko nitugira amahirwe ahari Gacaca zikazaba tuzakomeza tubaririze kuko nanjye abo bantu narabumvise kuko najye nahungiye hariya hafi kuri Eto nanjye nanyuze mu mirambo yo muri Eto , ariko hari abantu bamwe bagiye basigara kuburyo izo nterahamwe zafatanyije n' abitwaga ngo ni Abazuru bavaga za Kanombe , kuko iyi misozi yose ndetse nuko arinjye utanga ubuhamya njyenyine ariko hari abandi benshi babizi bazi nizo nterahamwe . ||| Among the most popular Interahamwes were avait Gérard Karanganwa , Kabagabo , Bizimungu , Idi and Kagarara . In fact , there were many Interahamwes but most of them did n't come back . I think they are still in Congo . All those Interahamwes disappeared but maybe there 's still a chance with the Gacaca jurisdictions . We will continue to get more information . I did n't personally see the people I told you about as I had sought refuge at ETO @-@ Kicukiro . I crossed over dead bodies ... but some people still survived . I heard that those Interahamwes were working in association with those of Kanombe who were called the ‘ Zulus ' because all these hills ... maybe it 's because I am the one giving you this testimony but there are other people who know better than I do and who even know those Interahamwes .
Tuza gucukura uru rwobo abenshi bari abaturage bo muri iyi misozi idukikije yose , abenshi barabazi bazi n' abagiye babanaga ahangaha . Ariko cyane cyane abo mbabwiye ba Bizimungu , ba Kabagabo , abitwaga ba Karanganwa Gérard , abitwa ... ibyo aribyo byose izo nterahamwe zirazwi bari batuye kuri uyu musozi wa Byimana aba Kanombe bo bazwi nabo bahaturiye hariya . Ariko ku buryo hano hapfiriye abantu barenze nk' ibihumbi nka bibiri , abo muri uru rwobo n' aha iruhande barahari mushobora kuza mukabareba hari n' abatarashyingurwa , muraza kubona ibisigazwa byabo tugenda tubibona buhoro buhoro . Hano bakazahakora neza tukazahubaka mu nyuma buri mwaka natwe tukazajya tuza kuhibukira abacu . ||| We dug this pit...most of the victims were from neighbouring sectors . Those people know them and they know they threw them into this pit ! But the Interahamwes such as Kabagabo , Karanganwa Gérard , such as ... are known because they lived here in Byimana ! I suppose that the Interahamwes from Kanombe are known by the people from Kanombe . Over 2,000 people were killed at this pit and nearby . You can see it , some of them have n't even been properly buried yet . You will see their remains as time goes . We 're planning to build this place so that we can come and commemorate every year .
Bacibiciye hano mu Rubirizi kuko nzi hari umugabo nzi w' umuveterineri wari wihishanye na mukuru wanjye hano nk' ubu tuzamubaza kuko yaramubonaga bamutwaye baje kumwicira ahangaha . ||| They were killed here in Rubirizi . There was even a veterinary who was hiding with my brother . We will ask him because he saw him being taken away to be killed .
Ni Damascène ? ||| Are you talking about Damascène ?
Oya yitwa Rwagapfizi . ||| No , he is called Rwagapfizi .
Rwagapfizi ? ||| Rwagapfizi ...
Rwagapfizi Joseph , n' ubu akorera Damascène ahongaho . ||| Joseph Rwagapfizi . He stil works for Damascène .
Nawe yari yihishe ahangaha Rwagapfizi ? ||| Was Rwagapfizi also hiding here ?
Muri aya mazu , ayangaya hariya muri laiterie ( ikaragiro ry' amata ) kuko yarahakoraga . ||| Yes , in those houses over there , the houses that belong to the diary . That 's where he was working .
Ubungubu tuvugeko abantu benshi bazaga ahangaha bazaga mu ma ( pick up ) baje mu camionette bazanye n' abasirikare bakabarasira ahangaha ? ||| If we agree that people were brought in pick ups ... were they accompanied by soldiers who shot them afterwards ?
Abasirikare bari bavanze n' interahamwe , bari bavangavanze abasirikare bavaga za Kanombe kandi bose bari bafite n' imbunda na za gerenade n' imipanga n' impiri byose . Ntago ari turiya twonyine , dore ziriya n' imbavu n' ibiki n' ukuvuga ko no hasi harimo n' abandi kuko bari ... buriya bariya ni abantu . ||| The Interahamwes were mixed with soldiers . They all came from Kanombe and were armed with grenades , guns , machetes , cudgels ... Not the ones you sae , check on the other side . There are others there ! Yes ! Human beings !
Umuntu witwa Ndiramiye ntago ujya umumenya ? ||| Do you know a certain Ndiramiye ?
Ndiramiye . ||| Ndiramiye ?
Ikibazo nticyumvikana ||| ...
Gacaca bamwe izabatubwira tu , hano hari umuhanda rwose munini n' imihanda yaragaragaraga neza mbese bamaraga kuba benshi bakabamanura hariya , abo nibo bahageraga bapfuye . ||| But I know Gacaca will let us know . There was a big road here ; the killers would put the victims together and whenever they reached a big number , they took them over there . The victims were already dead by the time they got there .
Nitwa Nzaramba Justin nkaba mvuka hano mu kagali ka Byimana , umurenge wa Niboye , akarere ka Kicukiro . Ndi mu myaka mirongo itanu n' ibiri ( 52 ) , mfite umugore n' abana . Hano mu Rubirizi haguye abantu batagira ingano ku buryo hakiboneka ibisigazwa , hakiboneka amagufwa aho ariho hose kuko mu Rubirizi hari ibyobo binyuranye bagiye bashyiramo ibiryo by' inka . Ariko imyobo miremire cyane ku buryo abantu babavanaga aho babaga bihishe mu giturage ariko abenshi nashoboye kumenya nabo bavanye kwa Conseiller bitaga Biziyaremye babazanaga ari ninjoro abantu b' abasirikare , ku buryo bazanyemo abantu twari duturanye abenshi bari biganjemo abakobwa , bakabazana hano muri Rubirizi hano . Hari umuhanda unyuze hano uvuye hariya za Kicukiro ukambukiranya Rubirizi ukagera Samuduha aha hantu ni mu cyobo hano iruhande niho hanyuze umuhanda . ||| My name is Justin Nzaramba and I was born here in Byimana cell , Niboye sector , Kicukiro district . I am 52 years , I am maried and I have children . A big number of people were killed here at Rubirizi . They were so many that we still find their remains till this day , there are still bones all over . In fact , there were many pits in Rubirizi , they served for the feeding of cows . However , the people who were hiding in their villages ... I did n't see the ones who were taken from Biziyaremye 's house , he was the counsellor . The soldiers used to kidnap them and take them to Rubirizi . Among them were our neighbours , most of them were women . There was a road from Kicukiro that passed here , near this put and that went up to Samuduha .
Noneho bakabageza ahangaha bamwe bakabanagamo ari bazima , abandi bakabanza bakabatema mbega nta muntu wabacitse baragiye babavanga n' amagufwa y' inka kuko hano mu Rubirizi hari inka nyinshi cyane . Ni naho biberaga bakarya amanyama mbega hari nk' iwabo babasangishaga abantu abishi babasangishaga abantu , abo barashe ni bakeya baravugaga ngo ntago bipfushiriza amasasu ubusa , kuko abenshi babahigishaga n' imbwa hano hose , niyo mpamvu rero tugifite akazi ko kuzahamba ntibazanashiramo ni kinini . Nkaha tuhabonye muri uyu mwaka nabwo tuberetswe n' abashumba bakora hano mu ikaragiro rya Rubirizi , ubu rero ni ukuzasaba ubuyobozi tukongera tugashakashaka tugashobora kuzashyingura bariya bantu mu cyubahiro nibwo tukibabona nyuma y' imyaka icumi yose . ||| After bringing their victims till here , the perpetrators used to throw them into the pit . Some were thrown in while still alive . Others after being cut down with machetes . No one could escape them ! Then they mixed up their bodies to the bones of cows since there were many cows here . This had actually become their home , they ate cow meat...people were bringing to them those who were meant to be killed . Very few were killed by bullet , they used to say they did n't want to waste their munitions . They were chasing people with dogs all around them . The consequence is that we still have so many victims ' bones to bury in respect . It will n't even be possible because this place is very wide ! For example , we were shown this place only very recently by pastors who work at the Rubirizi diary . They have been here for 10 years and we only found them recently ! We shall then request the Government that these people are buried in honor .
Kuko abantu babavanaga ... ||| These people were removed from ...
Hari hari imihanda miremire bakabicira ahangaha noneho bakongera bakazamukira hano hari imihanda myinshi bakazamukira hariya haruguru bagataha , bahigaga hose n' abavaga , hari n' amabeni ( Camion ) yajyaga avana abantu bapfuye hariya i Samuduha nabo babazanaga ahangaha kuko hari umugabo witwa Gafaranga yambwiye yuko abantu bakoraga muri minitrape bajyaga bashyira abantu muri bya bimodoka bya minitrape bakaza kubamenamo hano Rubirizi . ||| There were big roads here . The perpetrators were bringing them , killing then and then use a different road to go home since they were so many of them . They were chasing all over ! They ... there were even trucks that brought corpses here from Samuduha . There 's a man called Gafaranga who told me that drivers from the MINITRAP [ Ministry of Transportation ] put corpses into the trucks and then came to throw them here at Rubirizi .
Bicwaga mu buryo ki ? ||| How were the victims killed ?
Oooh , barababatemaguraga abo barashe ni bakeya , ntibabarasaga cyane kuko bafataga umuntu bakamutema imirambo bangaga yuko iguma ahongaho iwabo , ariko imyinshi n' iyariwe n' imbwa nanone hano . Hari iyo batashoboye nibura gushyira muri ibyo byobo abenshi bariwe n' imbwa bapfuye nabi , bamwe bapfuye bumva bamwe bapfuye ntago babicaga burundu barabakomeretsaga gusa bakazicwa n' ibikomere , birababaje cyane ino habereye ibintu bibi cyane nubwo bavuga ibyabereye i Nyanza , cyangwa ibyabereye muri za Eto hano Rubirizi naho habereye ibintu bikomeye cyane ibintu bibi . Abacitse ku icumu ni bakeya nkubu kubona abantu barokotse muri iyi segiteri cyangwa iyo hakurya ni bake cyane ukurikije ukuntu bari batuye ni bake cyane abenshi ni bashyashya , kandi abo bantu b' interahamwe abafunzwe ni bake abandi bashobora kuba bari muri Congo . Icyakora bamwe bigeze kuza bashobora kwirega abandi baranangiye ariko ubirebye hapfuye abantu benshi muri Kicukiro no muri Rubirizi cyane cyane . ||| Oh ! They cut them down into pieces . Very few were shot . They mutilated their victims and then got rid of them because they did n't want to see the corpses of their victims near them . However , most of the dead bodies were devoured by dogs . They did n't throw all the corpses into pits , the rest was eaten by dogs . In fact , some people were n't completely killed , they mutilated them and then left them to die of the wounds , after suffering greatly . They died a horrible death . What happened here is so atrocious ! It was terrible even if it 's not spoken about as much as the Nyanza and ETO @- Kicukiro events . There were dreadful scenes of atrocities here at Rubirizi ! Very few survived here ; when we consider the number of inhabitants of this sector or of the neighbouring ones , we realized that it 's very low compared to the number of the people who lived here before . Most of those who live here today are new . In addition , very few Interahamwes are in jail . The rest are probably in Congo . But some did surrender themselves ; the rest are not there anymore ... In fact , mostly the Kicukiro and Rubirizi inhabitants lost their lives here .
Ibyo aribyo byose nubwo uvuga ngo hano haguye abantu benshi , birumvikana ko ibyo aribyo byose abo bantu nabo bishwe n' abantu benshi nagira nkubaze niba hari abantu mwaba muzi baba baragize uruhare muri ibi bintu baba bagihari bakidegembya ahangaha ? ||| Obviously , if there was a big number of victims , that means the perpetrators were many as well . I 'd like to ask you if you know some of the people who participated in those acts ... maybe they 're free ... ?
Kwidegembya abenshi ntibagihari cyane cyane abari muri CDR , abantu bari muri ya parti ya CDR na MRND nibo babandi nababwiraga bitwaga ba Idi , ba Kabagabo bari bafite n' ama modoka yabo bagenda bagafata ama modoka nibyo birirwaga bakora gusa , gusahura no kuzana abandi bantu abitwaga ba Bizimungu n' abitwaga ba Kagarara bari bafite n' andi mazina biyita ariko abenshi barazwi n' imiryango yabo irahari . ||| Free ... most of them are no longer free . Those perpetrators were members of CDR and MRND [ political parties ] . People like Idi , Kabagabo whom I told you about were driving their cars , looting and looking around for other guys such as Bizimungu , Kagarara ... they had given themselves nicknames but we know their names and their families are still alive !
