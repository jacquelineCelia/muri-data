I and the other sister of mine whom I told you , tried to rebuild our home house in order to have where to stay . In our financial weakness we managed to get small jobs . We worked in O.I.M and the small salary we could get out of it , we would use it to buy cement or other good people would buy for us cement . We finally completed the house . It was a big problem to have where to live ; it was hard for us to stay in several places , spending the whole year changing houses to live in when sometimes the people in there are financially unstable . The ones who are financially stable are mostly bad people . Our houses were destroyed and their too . So asking for help when they also have such problem , we preferred to let it go . After completing the house , my sister got married and I stayed with the housekeeper . As time passed by I had this idea to go back to school and I finally went to school at ULK University . I have finished the second year and I am going for the third year . It does n't mean that the life of genocide survivors is easy ; we are not treated the way we should be treated . We always hear someone is dead , a genocide survivor , and another day you hear a criminal was released . That is the way we live , a criminal was released and a genocide survivor was killed .

It took long time before my parents gave birth to other children after we left Burundi . They were still preparing themselves for having other children . Therefore , the young ones were much younger than us . They were very obedient kids . They considered me as their aunt . They considered me as someone more mature than them . We used to discipline them because that is what mum used to tell us . Another thing I can say , our mother had forbidden us to fight . We used to teach them good manners ; we would tell them that none of them should abuse the other . She used to tell us that insulting someone as stupid could make them grow up with a belief that he or she is actually stupid . Therefore , she would warn them never do it again , she told them she did not want to ever hear them abusing each other . And that is the discipline we taught to our young sisters . Of course they were naughty just like other children are and we would punish them . But they would never abuse each other because we told them not to .

We experienced the war for quite a long time , not just one or two months . From the 7th of April 1994 to the 1st of August 1994 , we were going through the war because we were still running away . We witnessed the Interahamwes murdering many people . Some were shot down and some were beaten up with clubs and we saw it all happening . We sometimes had to jump over dead bodies as we were running away . We could at times reach a roadblock and they would tell us to go away with the hope that we would be killed on the next one . In other cases we were able to somehow escape . I saw many of them killing people .

Another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an Inyenzi . He was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . Then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort . The place where we lived was located in a very bad area . You have probably heard of a place called ‘ Camp Butaro ’ . All the refugees who came from Ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area .

He said that it was an invented scenario . I want to ask him why he arrested people knowingly . How did he consider that ?

And now you are telling me that we go and meet those people , how do you think they are going to kill us ? And in case they killed me first , how will you handle it ? Definitely you will dye of sorrows . I will stay here . @" It was in the sorghum plantation . Then I decided to lay in the way so that they come and step on me or hit me at once rather than being killed with torture . Therefore , I came down the hill and laid in the way . Then she said , "@ bye ... I can not dye just seated here . @" Immediately she left . That was the last time I saw her , [ it was around the 12th April in 1994 ... until towards the end of September , that is when I saw her again ] She just left me and said that she could not sit and wait for her death .

But as a person who was in Murambi , what would be the souvenir that you will never forget ? Something you ever think about , maybe blood that dropped on you ...

Akagerageza kubyirengagiza...mbese na none agashaka kwirengagiza uko yakagombye kubaho . ||| Personally , I do not understand how a human being healthy of mind can attack another human being with 2 ears , 1 nose , legs ... just like him or her . A human being like him or her ! And they take a machete , hack him or her down and see blood shedding ... it is beyond understanding . Personally , I do n't think that person did it by himself or herself , but they were used by Satan to an extent where I have forgiven them all , it does n't matter whether they have asked for forgiveness or not . What happened happened and it is true that I can not forget it . For those who are still in school , I would tell them to seriously study and to prepare themselves a better future . It happens at times that they want to behave in a certain way depending on the town in which they live or which school they go to , but it should n't be the case . A child should not forget what is behind maybe just because he or she is lucky enough to live with a well @-@ off family and thus behave as though he or she should n't live in a certain way .

They are generally all Tutsis and also someone can include those who were against it in that time of looking for leadership in the leaders of political parties ......... if you look at the first night , they started with people like Agath who are the ones that died first .

I heard an explosion of an Europlain , however we did n't know it was a europlain . Then later in about two or one hour 's time we started hearing grenades around the neighbourhood . They were terribly many and unsual in fact somewhere in the neighbourhood , someone screamed and when he screamed we heard a grenade exploded . When the second grenade was exploded , that person stopped screaming and never screamed again . The trend continued until deep in the night at around 03:00 a.m. and we had not known what had happened .

Ntabwo ureba umuntu ngo umubonemo ubuzima , ureba umuntu ukamubonamo apfuye . ||| The consequences of being a survivor are very many . When I look at us the survivor of the genocide , some of us survived without really surviving . Some women who were raped are living with HIV @/@ AIDS , some survived but they have no one to talk to , that is another type of death , those are some of the genocide consequences . The other thing is that you can never live a full life again , you live half of a life , and you live a life full of questions , of uncertainties , of maybes . Maybe it is going to happen again , you 're never at peace within your heart . That 's what they call trauma . You constantly are traumatized . Your life is incomplete . For example sometimes I can be walking in town and I look at crowds of people and I see their bodies lying down , as though they were dead . I look at somebody and I imagine him or her dead . Even me myself I sometimes imagine myself dead . Not so much because I think of death , I am still young , but because of the many people I saw being killed . Those are the consequences of surviving . You do not look at people and see life in them , you see them dead instead .

I remained with the other one tied her to my clothes like this , we walked around together when I went out of the house there she was with me and thought to myself there is nowhere I am going to reach with these children with this young girl , and they said that we will get her from you when I went to fetch water they would say that we will get her from you and I said that you will n't get her ! Why get her from me she is a Hutu do you think she is a Tutsi ? When I went to fetch water I found corpse all round , I said this is a tragedy in my home so they came closer and closer and I asked them what is this that you are doing ? They said that if I say what I had seen they would kill me on my way to the market . On my way to the market they surrounded me but I had drunk my medicine and I had some in my hands . I told them , you are lying and they said , is it a surprise ? Presidential guards who had come from Kigali came I got some fuel from them and I said that if anyone ever came to get anyone in my house I will burn them . Just like they would burn me . They threatened to kill me , they said that since that old woman likes Tutsis we will kill her , we do n't know her back ground and neither do we talk to her .

They took them and then ... in my mind , I could n't think of nothing , neither could I feel anything . While I was hiding there , [ I can not find the right way of describing how I was feeling ] I sat and thought for a while ... it was around 11:00 a.m. I got out of the bush because there were dogs passing all the time , trained to search for people during the day . I went into a certain hole where we used to spend time and in the evening , at around 7:00 p.m I left the hole . The I thought , "@ If they took my whole family at home , maybe at grandpa 's they are still there . Maybe they hid and came back to sleep . @" When I reached there ... I was very dark almost in the morning , it was at around 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. I found nobody at home [ his grandfather 's home ] and the house had no doors left . I looked for people but I could n't find anyone . I checked at the road ... I went to look for them at the road but I did n't find them . I met soldiers walking around . There was a lady called Françoise who lived in Shyorongi . She looked older than her age . A certain soldier asked me , "@ Are n't you Françoise 's brother ? @" I said "@ Yes I am . @" Then he took me and said that Françoise was his friend . He took me and then I went to live together with the soldiers . Later , all the soldiers who were there were taken to Jari , where there is a radio antenna . I continued to live with soldiers but I had never seen people being killed ; I thought it was just chaos and that things would change with time . The following morning , they brought other Tutsis people ... The first person I saw being murdered was a lady whom they got and cut with a bayonet ; they cut her neck open and blood spread all over . I was so scared ; it was my first time to witness murder . I had never seen her before . She was living in Jari but up to now I do n't know her name . I just saw her there but I still remember her today .

The first time I passed there , I was with my mum and she said ; "@ I am going to find means of how we would go to Burundi because there 's no other alternative . @" But as I told you , she stopped on the way .

But my older brother was not there ; together with other cousins who lived at home , they had taken them to hide in the ceiling of other people 's house . Therefore , they did n't find any ... they only found my parents and I plus the young ones , who had come to hide at home thinking that we would be protected . On the 14th is when the group of attackers ran after us and searched for us in all corners where we were hiding . We fled but they followed us and found us . I myself hid under the bed . They even hit me with a club on my ribs while they were searching for me . Then I decided to get out . I had realised that they may kill me inside there . We came out . They ran after my young sisters . They were young and they were screaming . They took my parents . Then they said , "@ Everyone is dead , you are the only ones remaining , yet you are the top Inyenzi [ cochroaches ] " then they killed them . Mum said goodbye to us before they left . We asked them to let us say goodbye to them but they never let us say goodbye to dad . But we got to say goodbye to our mum . Then mum told us , "@ Be strong . @" And the way she told us , "@ Nothing will ever happen to you . You have several relatives in Burundi and in Kigali . You shall live with them with no problem and nothing will happen to you @" still surprises me today . The only thing she told us is to be strong . We said goodbye to her and then we left . Then they said , "@ We will n't kill you , we only want to kill old chockroaches . The rest of you can leave . @" We were taken to a certain old man 's house but there were several other Interahamwe . They told those Interahamwe to keep an eye on us , "@ These kids should not leave this place , we shall kill them later ! @" They were back on the 15thof April 1994 . The Interahamwe had spent the whole night watching us ; they abused us , bragging about how they had killed people and some of them [ the people they killed ] were our relatives . In the morning they came to get our sisters . They said , "@ You , you look older , killing you would require some energy . @" Therefore , they took our sisters and killed them . Poor kids , all the way they went saying goodbye to us , "@ Bye bye ... we wish you a good life and may God help you ... @" It was surprising to see them talking to us as though they knew we would actually survive for everyone [ Tutsi ] was entitled to die . I really wonder why they said words like such as 'we wish you a long , good life ’ . Later we left that place when we realized that they wanted to separate me from my brother . They were planning to take me to Congo and do with me ... We bribed someone and then he helped us escape at night . We left as though we were going for a short call , one by one and then we all left . We walked so much that it seemed as though we had walked around the whole of Rwanda , in Gitarama , in Gikongoro and maybe in Cyangugu as well . Most of the time we used to walk at night . I guess ... For us to survive , we went through several hardships ; it would take too long to talk about everything one by one . We went through many things , we were starving most of the time , we spent nights in the bush . We used to get somewhere and fail to find ... I remember once in the forest , we had no idea where we were , neither which province it was . Then we suddenly heard hyenas . We got into the forest ; we did n't seem to know whether we wanted to get in or out of it . Then we heard the hyenas squealing and heading towards us , wanting to bite us . We slept there and were rained on . We used to hide at day time and spend the night walking . I was with my brother called Freddy . I guess that is it .

Then I asked her where she thought I could go when her dad had chased me , where she expected me to go . The man called Kayigamba whose daughter was my namesake said ... By then , the attackers were having several meetings . In fact , in Bugesera people had started fleeing . I went to a place called Migina . There came a man called Shiriduwi , I am not sure if it is Shiriduwi . He came , pulled me from the roadside where I was sitting with the girl and then asked me what my tribe is . I kept quiet . I had nothing to say ... There was another man called Biya , who was a young brother to the doctor in that area . They both knew me very well . At that time , they were in a meeting and when they came out , they defended me . They said I am from their family . That 's the way I survived the attackers . He [ Bayi ] told me to go home . Then I told him that I have no where to pass in order to reach home , he then asked his father to take me home because his father had a motorbike . He left for his home and I went to my home too .

At this time she should have been able to do something with herself . But because she did not have anyone to push her so that she studies on time and complete her studies , her life seems to have declined instead . When she realised that it was just the two of us who survived and yet she was the oldest , she had no other alternative but to leave school so that I would go to school . She went back to school after FARG was founded ; that is after FARG had agreed to help us monthly . But before FARG came , she had sacrificed herself so that I also get to some grade . Up to now , she has n't completed her studies . Normally at her age , she is not supposed to be in secondary school but that is where she is now ; she is in senior five at the moment . And whenever she comes back home [ from boarding school ] , she finds several problems . And me who remained behind , she finds there is nothing I improved because I have no job , no one to protect me , so that I also can help her . She comes from school and goes back into the miserable life that she left behind .

Besides , when I finished organizing myself and putting everything together , I found Cynthia , my cousin , the daughter of mom 's younger sister alive ! So I was living with both of them . I t was n't easy as Cynthia used to spend the whole night screaming , she still does it at times today . Even today she wakes up in the middle of the night saying , "@ Let 's flee , the Interahamwes are coming to kill us ... let 's flee , the Interahamwes are coming to kill us . @" So they 'd make a lot of noise in the night , even Shumbusho would join her . It was as though in their mind , they were still living in the war . They did n't believe it was over . I put Shumbusho in school but it was n't going to be possible for Cynthia to be away as she was in a very bad state . She went back to school later on . Shumbusho on the other hand ... I was trying my best to make my children happy . I would use my salary to shop and pay the rent ... I suddenly had all these responsibilities ... My reaction was n't to ... The life I lived then did n't quite match with my age ... I turned 18 during the war . I did n't think like an 18 year old person . I felt I needed to do all I could so that Shumbusho and Cynthia could study . That 's all I was concentrating on .

Icyo kibazo kiragoye kuko ... numva ... aho kugirango byitwe ubutabera , bitari ubutabera , ni byiza ko babareka noneho bakigira hanze gusa . Kuko sinakwifuza ko babaroha mu ruzi nk' uko baroshye mama mu ruzi . Mama bamuroshye mu ruzi , baroha data wacu , baroha sogokuru , baroha abantu benshi bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] yanjye . Uroshye umuntu umwe rero , ntacyo bimaze . Kandi ikindi , leta iragaburira izi mfungwa . Irita ku ndwara zabo kandi ni benshi . Ibyiza rero ni uko babareka bakaza bakajya hanze , gusa bakajya babaha inyigisho wenda mu kwezi , cyangwa mu mezi angahe ... zibagarura mu bumuntu kuko ibyo bakoze nabo bari batakaye . Kuko uuturanyi mwahanaga inka , mwasangira inzoga , mwasangira iki ... nabyo si ubuzima . Ni ibintu wumva ko nk' uko nakubwiye u Rwanda rwari rwatakaye . Rwari rwatakaye ahantu , kuko nta n' undi muntu warwumvaga . Rwari ruri ahantu nta n' undi muntu yarebaga . Ndumva rero ikintu navuga ubucamanza , ubutabera kereka...nabyo ntibyampaza kubona wishe uwo muntu . Nta n' icyo byamarira . Ariko nanone nabyo ntibinshimisha , kumva byiswe ubutabera , atari ubutabera . Kumva ko umuntu yishe ejo bundi yakoze iki ngo arakuze . Mbega ntiyishe abakuze nkawe ? Ko se bo bicaga abakuze ?

Baze duturane . ||| It is tough question because I feel like instead of it being called justice when it is not justice anyway , it would be better that they just let them go free . That 's all I can wish them . Because I would not wish them to be thrown into the river the way they threw my mother into the river . My mother was drowned into the river together with my uncle , my grandfather and many other members of my family . Therefore throwing just one person in there is useless . The other thing is that the Government takes care of the prisoners ; it has to feed them and provide healthcare for them and they are many . It would therefore be better to let them free and maybe to sensitise them every month or so to help them become human again as they had probably lost their humanity . How can you kill the neighbour you used to exchange cows with and share a drink with ? It 's not normal . It shows that Rwanda was lost as I was telling you , because no one heard its voice then . We were somewhere where no one could see us . What I can say about justice ... unless .... Even that would not be enough , even if they killed them ... But it does not sound fair to me when it is called justice . Knowing that somebody killed other people the other day and they say he 's an adult ! Were the people they killed not adults ? Or saying that they were children ! Do children kill ? They do not ! Why were they not children while killing ? Let them free them , which is what will make more sense to me . Let them come and live with us .

According to the Rwandan constitution in force till June 10th 1991 , all Rwandans including you adhered to MRND . Surely it was the same for you . All people adhered to MRND .

Tukabasha gutekereza noneho tugashyira ibitekerezo byacu ku murongo ariko dufite na moyen matériel . ||| What I wish , I do n't if I should call it a wish . Let me say first what makes me happy . Mostly it is to know that I have done something to help a genocide survivor . It may be giving advice or helping with something . However simple it may be , I am happy when I am the one who thought of helping and I actually did it ... I think I wish that all genocide survivors especially the young ones should be given the advantage of a scholarship because the old women who survived do not have much hope to live . They are desperate and sometimes miserable but for us who are still young we can go to school , we can exchange ideas with different people . Also the government should continue financing FARG so that those who were still kids when the genocide took place can continue their studies up to higher levels like we did . Maybe it 's difficult for us to adapt to this new life as we have the responsibility to take care of our young brothers and sisters . That 's when we can come together as genocide survivors and help each other in an association such as AERG where one gets advice , which helps me to fulfill my responsibilities of taking good care of my brothers and sisters . That 's what I wish for . I wish survivors would get a good life after their studies . After achieving that unity , then we would organize ourselves and plan to do something together ; that is if we have the necessary material [ financial support ] .

Ubuhake is something people despised later on , work was introduced by the white man ; the whip and the prison too .

I believe you understand how problems kept piling , up all at once . Then I asked him " why sir ? @" He replied , "@ You came very late after I have already taken back the forms . And since I took the forms , there is no alternative , you will study but you will never sit for the final exams . Maybe next academic year ... @" I got so disappointed that day . I imagined spending days in class yet I were n't going to sit for exams . Then I asked the headmaster to let me go back home but the headmaster said no ! I again asked him to let me go back home , once again he said no ! I got annoyed and he realised that I was . The following day I went to him again he refused . The next day I told him that I needed permission to go and tell people at home about the situation . Headmasters never know student 's details he thus gave me the permission .

They were breathing deeply but when I realized that they were Tutsi , I joined them and took a sit . I remember that time almost half a liter of sweat came out [ of my body ] . I laid down and first took a rest . But I could hear gun shots towards Kayumba area . Later I woke up and we slightly opened the window and piped outside . That is the time I started seeing people 's blood . I saw people being hacked . Well even before , people were killed but because I was running all the time , I never observed it clearly like then . I would just run for my own life .

He was a very tall Tutsi ; they crucified him by the road and said that he should be a reference in the future . Meaning , those who would want to see how Tutsis looked like in the future , would be shown that body . In other words , Interahamwe thought that no Tutsi who would survive . Their mission was to kill every Tutsi in Bugesera and leave one man who was handicapped but survived the Nyamata killings . He was called Bahimuza . He was terribly injured at Nyamata but he is still alive . That whoever wanted to know about the history of the Tutsi in Rwanda would see that man . That is to say that the Interahamwe wanted to wipe out all Tutsi .

We can not forget that we have to live and we are aimed at living but what these men did for us , it is not that hard for us to do it too but we were not created for that . I realized it is even hard for me to kill a rabbit or a chicken . Imagine you take an innocent baby and hit the baby on the wall or remove an old woman all clothes and rape her . You ask yourself if this person was created as you were created and you can not get an answer . Another thing that hurts me , you find a person really confessing proudly of the a hundred people he killed , the horrible way in which he killed those innocent people , and the next day he is realized because of that . You find the government is spending a lot on him while there are old women let 's say in Gisozi who have nothing to eat , no where to live . This should be taken care of , the government should think about this . Okay for us we are still young men , they should care about weak people , wounded people , raped people and old women so they could die happily because the ones who betrayed us die happily . They came back and were given their properties . Got back their money from the bank got back their houses . It is sad to see someone who destroyed your house living in a very nice house of his father . We do n't want those nice houses , the government should build for Genocide survivors houses to live in . it is our right , when he is given back his properties he lives nicely than us . If this is not changed so the government will n't be helping us .

It seemed like God was with us . Then they got tired and left . It was getting dark . So , for about an hour we started searching for one another . We whistled our names because that was our sign . Everyone was around . We held each other 's shirts and walked on a line again . After that place , we did not meet other hardships in other places . It seemed to be paradise . Because we could n't understand it . It was too unusual for us to move without hiding . Therefore , we moved ahead and night was falling . We also found that unusual . We continued walking the whole night and when it was almost dawn , we did not hide instead we continued to walk . At around four o'clock in the morning , there was nothing moving . [ Of course at around four in the morning some activities take place ] . But that time there was none . Around four thirty there was still no activity or action [ openly taking place ] . At around five in the morning , there was not a single activity , not even birds singing . On the other hand , at around six in the morning , we started seeing cows without a shepherd ; we were surprised . We continued to walk but later on we had a problem of how we were going to cross Nyabarongo in order to go to Juru hill .

They gathered everything and said to us , "@ Do n't worry , nothing will happen to you . @" They divided our livestock between themselves ; some took two cows , others took three , others took goats and we saw them take everything with our own eyes . Some took hens ... they just took anything they came across .

It started way before , in 1990 and the killing increased in 1994 . In 1990 they were already teaching them how to kill , as they were preparing the genocide . If we had known that the Interahamwes were going to kill that way , we would have fled before , we never thought it would reach that extent . People were murdered in many different ways .

Sometimes I would go to fetch water for cleaning the coffee . Most of the time , that would be my work in his home . I guess you know that by then it was harvest time . for coffee as well as for other things . They used to give me a lot of work because I was vulnerable . We would spend the whole day in coffee plantations and take it for grinding . From there , I would go for water . I would not use a normal can ; I would use an old can to fetch water and I would bring water with it . I would bring half can water . Not a full one .

They came up the hill and all of them were drunk . They were saying , "@ The people we dumped in the latrine must have died . @" They proceeded . The lady was still agonizing .

Today , ten years later some people have already learnt a lesson from it , others have not yet and some are just there , not having learnt anything yet .

I think we should not only remember the genocide every year but also in helping out the survivors . Because remembering what happened only once year does n't really benefit the survivors much . We should remember it every year , everyday because they do remember it every day , not just once a year . On an international scale , we should remember the genocide in helping out those who lived through the genocide , the survivors . We could remember them in teaching the children about it because as far as we 're concerned , we 've already been destroyed . We need to teach the next generation about the genocide , the descendants of the Hutu , the descendants of the Tutsi , the descendants of the Twa , all need to remember that the genocide actually happened . It needs to reach a point where those who need to understand where their fathers are faulty understand it , as well as those who need to understand the way their parents were victimized . In conclusion we need to make sure that even the child who will be born tomorrow will know that what happened in our country was wrong .

First of all they removed the Rwandan form of governance , where by the king was the over all ruler of the country , they removed the king and replaced by Leopold who was a white man , and they would continuously refer to him as the king ignoring our king . The leaders became servants so that they could show that it is that and those who were doubting stop doubting .

I do n't know if there has been justice . It is there because we have Gacaca . Before Gacaca to me was something very small because Gacaca has always been there between neighbours , for when children would fight or cows would go to eat the neighbours ' crops . It did not exist for someone who has committed murder . So if we set Gacaca , it is because the world did not help us in making sure that justice is done . If the International Community had really been involved in what happened in Rwanda , people would have been punished the way they deserve . Yes justice exists...people are judged and freed if they win their trial ... The other thing is about the people who are judged in Arusha . Once they are judged and condemned , they are taken to jail to Mali or Senegal . They build big houses with a TV and everything . Is that being imprisoned really ? What about the people they killed so horribly ? Do you think that is justice ? I do n't look at it as justice because they are free anyway . To me it is all the same and maybe they should just let them go as long as they let us leave in peace and it never happens again .

But before he left , he told us that , "@ several people are still coming in Kibuye but they are all worried because there is a rumor that they are going to kill them . There is a possibility that we will never see each other again . @" Be said bye to us and left . We stayed there and suddenly there came a group of attackers saying [ they were singing ] ; we have wiped away all the people who were in the stadium in Kibuye . They are all finished . Maybe those who remained in their home areas are the ones who have survived and we have to search for them seriously . We shall use dogs to hunt them so that no one stays behind . @" Apparently those who went to Kibuye were the old people and they had killed all of them . They had set roadblocks on every entrance and exit of the stadium . No one was able to get out ; whoever would need to pass they would hack him or her . After hearing that ... since I was the eldest to my sister whom we were together , I realized things had worsened . Then I wondered , " since they have killed them , where are we left ? @"

Ariko Micheveux yarapfuye . ||| Well , when I said 2 weeks , I also realized later on that I made a mistake . I spent about 2 weeks hiding together with Micheveux and that 's the time she one day told me she was convinced she was going to die . I asked her why and she told me she felt like she was smelling blood all over her body . I told her she was n't going to die , trying to reassure her . But it was as though she actually knew she was going to die because that 's the same day her whole family was taken away . Only a boy survived plus a girl who was in Butare . Michoveux died with them .

Therefore , one clan died . And , they really killed them ; they killed them so painfuly with a lot of torture . Some were drowned in rivers and lakes ; others were thrown in latrines or pits . Until when the Inkotanyi liberated this country and ceased the war and the killings . And later they set up a law of arresting those who perticipated in the killings . They were arrested ... those ones that we would see , we would report them . But our primary desire is to see people being purnished accordingly . A killer ... the culture of not punishing should be abolished completely . Because during Habyarimana 's regime no body would be punished over killing someone . A hutu would not be punished for killing a tutsi . Neither would he be imprisoned . It was an earlier planned program and they all knew all about it . All they did , they were prepared for it [ genocide ] , it was not a sudden event .

I have lost so much because of those people . They took away my family and everyone else who lost his or her people lost in the same way . If my opinion is that they should be imprisoned and remain there - I have asked some people - and I believe that would be the right thing to do ... And that 's why I am saying that if I had known it from before , I would n't have spent so much time running after them for them to be put in jail . In jail , it is the government that feeds them . Not only did they kill my people - I 'd expect that their meals are expensive , their lives , their health , all that is costly - so the country is losing and it 's already lost anyway . So in my opinion , releasing them so that they can be working for the country is n't bad . There 's no other solution anyway . Because if I take the case of my home area in Kibuye , almost everyone in Rubengera killed ; even the one who did n't take a machete pointed at the place where a Tutsi was hiding , showing his or her friend . It reached a point where even children killed in Kibuye , a ten year old child or a seven year old one were busy looking for people in the bush . Meaning that all those people should be taken to jail which is impossible . How would the country develop if everyone is in jail ? That 's not possible . So we just have to accept , there 's no other solution . But it would be so much better if all of them would accept their crime and apologize . Not so much because they know acknowledging it and apologizing is a means of being in jail for a shorter time . I have a problem with it ! They teach them that if they accept their crimes , their punishment shall be reduced . One should first of all apologize from the heart , it should n't be because someone else has instilled it in one 's mind . They keep telling them how when they apologize even after killing many people , they 'll be in jail for a short time . It 's useless .

However , this new Government is totally different from the former one . Because the former government was following the ideology of division among people . And , that is all they would teach people . But this Government is teaching people how to live together and how to share and washes away the bad thoughts out of people 's minds . Things like grid , killing ... this Government does n't support that ideology of killing . All this Government needs is people to live with others peacefully ; it wants killers to ask for forgiveness . That is all it wants ... they want people to say the truth .

Habyarimana was chief commander . I remember it was on the 28th feb 1973 , when they attacked our home village . They burnt and killed many people . That time they killed so many people . I had a brother -in-law whose shop was destroyed . He escaped through a bush . They tried to look for him but they never got him . But his shop was already distroyed . That time we fled and came to Kigali in Biryogo . We spent there less that a month 's time . Then they made a patrol of capturing all the Tutsis and take them to Bugesera in Maranyundo . I guess you have ever heard about it ... I am among the people who were imprisoned in Maranyundo . Even that time they made a patrol but it was just for getting the Tutsis . We realised it when we were in Bugesera . They came and transported us to Bugesera in Maranyundo in the bush . They used trucks , min buses , and those big cars that transport beers from Gisenyi [ from Bralirwa ] . Therefore they gathered us there in t he Muhima prison . By then it was a police . It used to be called Commissariat .

I was born in Kibuye in a district , which was called Mabaza in sector called Rubengera , in Kibagiro cell . I am 21 years old . Well about the testimony of my life before the war , I was with my parents , my relatives , and my family at large . Then time came for me to start studying . The war started while I was in primary four and from then , we started having hardships in our studies . We would be asked about our ethics , they would come and say , "@ Tutsis stand there and Hutus stand here . @" But on my side , I never knew any thing . I remember sometimes they would ask me and I would tell them that , "@ my family belongs to Abanyiginya ... @" [ a clan ] I could n't understand what they meant . But my teacher knew my dad , so he would go and ask my father and then he would know it from there . Otherwise , all the time he asked me , I never used to reply him a single word . Because in my home , they never used to brief us about where to stand in case they asked for Tutsi or Hutus to stand @-@ up . Therefore , things continued like that and it never took long , I shifted from the first class to the second class to the third up the fourth . I remember it was in the first term in April . I remember one time when Habyarimana had died ; he died on the 6th of April 1994 . But on the 7th that is when I knew that he was died yet others knew it earlier . We were seated outside the house with several other people who were wondering about the president 's death . And after some time , we saw across in Mushubati and other areas , houses burning . We were many people seated outside . And , immediately we saw a very big group of attackers coming from Bandamiko they were the Bakiga , who lived just across . They were with a certain man who was called Fayineto ; he was our neighbour . He was introducing them the areas , which were mainly occopied by Tutsis . They passed in the midst of our group and said , "@ there is a big number of Tutsis living in this area ! It is only the Tutsis covering this hill . Therefore , once you are done with those areas in the valley , you will come and do a good job here . @"

He asked me to accompany him while he was looking for it . I told him it was okay as long as he went in front and I followed him which he agreed . When we reached in front I heard people talking . I quickly hid myself behind a tree trunk that was around . It was about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. He moved forward and I heard them shooting him with many bullets ; he screamed only once and died . I turned and took off . Because it was at dawn , when I got far back , I was able to see two other soldiers ; they were from the other group . I continued walking with them and we passed through the Inkotanyi 's camp ; we passed there while they were cooking and they just saw us running . Therefore , they got hold of their guns and ran after us . We entered some trench that was covered by long grass and laid there . One of the two soldiers got a grenade and said , " In case we hear them coming , I will explode this grenade and we shall all died together . @" Because they had told us that when an Inkotanyi gets hold of you , he tortures you to death by cutting off your ears , your figures ... slowly until you die .

Then all the Hutus had ran away towards Kibungo ... Kibungo sector ; I do n't know if you know it or hear about it . Therefore , that is when she came and asked me if I was aware of what had happened . Meanwhile , I thought everybody had died and that I was the only survivor . She asked me , "@ Why are you still here ? @" "@ What do you expect me to do ? @"@ , I replied Then she told me that the Inkotanyi took up the rest to Nyamata . "@ Nobody is remaining in this sector . Even the Interahamwe are running way . @" She assured me . Then I told her that I was not able to join them . She suggested to help me walk up to the road . "@ The Inkotanyi will never see you if you remain here @"@ , she said . It was in the evening beginning to get dark ; it was some minutes passed six p.m. Then she said , "@ I guess they will n't come at this time because it is late , but they may come in the morning . Make sure they find you there . @" Then she helped me walk up to a certain house . In that house I found several other kids , who were in the worst condition compared to me ; some were dying , others did n't have legs and could n't move . Others had started rotting from there . In brief , when I reached there , I seemed to be the strongest around . Yet I too was already desperate that my arms had started rotting ; they were weak , I could n't lift an arm to any angle . It took us about ... about four hours to get there . Then we heard people walking around , asking if there could be anybody inside the house . They hit the door and came in . They first saw me because I was the only one who was in better conditions than the others because my legs had not been hacked . Others were horribly injured . Some were hacked around the neck , on the legs , on the head and the arms as well . Two of them were dying due to weeks of hunger and thirst , since those dead bodies lying around . Then he asked if there was anybody who could try and join others . But later he realized that no one was able to walk . Then he asked me if I could try and walk but I said , "@ no I can n't @"@ . And then he sent that lady to Nyamata to bring some people and stretchers to carry us . But when she left , she did not come back . She was afraid of her husband ; he was a Hutu and a perpetrator . Actually she was praying she would find a way to join her people , she did not have anywhere to pass .

Kuko nimugoroba , ubundi , nimugoroba twabaga tuzi ko nta gitero kigomba kuza . ||| Yes he is still alive . He is now in Bugesera in Nyamata . So , we went on with our life of hiding . There was a man called Batanga Paul , he was an Interahamwe . He had a gun with the mission of killing all young men who were left in that area . Yet the only cultured boy left in that area was my older brother . Because he was educated . Therefore that man was given a mission of finding my brother dead or alive . Then at around seven o'clock in the evening ... we used to go to the destroyed houses at night and cook from there . Because we thought that at night , there was no Interahamwe who could attack us .
Ubwo bwakwira tukazamuka ncumbagurika ncumbagurika , hari umukecuru twabanaga , agafata ibibabi by' igiti sinzi ibyo ari byo , ubwo akabivuguta agakandishaho . Ubwo akaba ariwo muti mbona .

That was the medicine that was available . Time came when a person from our village came and told me that my older cousin and his other two brothers were still alive . The three brothers were all alive .

Then he told the old man , "@ we heard that in your home , there are Gahizi 's children who survived , now these people are on my case . They said they must kill them or take Gahizi 's cows , which remained here . @"

Nibwo tumubwiye tuti @: reka twambuke tuve mu gifunzo . ||| We heard those boys screaming , "@ ahhh..yiiii @" and they [ Interahamwe ] were saying , "@ Get out . @" Finally they were killed . After killing them , they continued going , talking loudly . After a few steps , they met other people and killed them ; they killed everyone in the small groups we had been with . At half past five or at six , the perpetrators stopped the killings and went home . The other boy and I went back to check on the small groups of people , the first two people were dead and the other one was on the verge of death his head had been hacked and the brain was spilling and his breath was coming in spasms , we took the banana fibers that we were sitting on and covered their body , as a form of burial . We continued ahead and found another group ; in this group they were all dead . In the last group there was a girl whose brains were out but she was still alive . She told us something that I can never forget ; she said that she was so thirsty , that she wanted something to drink . But water in the swamp was extremely dirty ; we were urinating , shitting in the swamp . We told her to let us get out of the swamp .

She a parent who knew very well how to look after us . Her great example is still very vivid in me . She was very open with us , she used to tell us everything . We used to think it strange that she would tell us that she loved us ; everyone we would tell about it could not believe it , as it is not something a parent easily expresses to his @/@ her child [ in our culture ] . But she was a parent who knew how to look after her children . She was very sociable and people still say so today . She was a very good adviser , people used to come home to seek advice from her . She had very many friends and there would always be visitors at home . We used to see several people coming home ; some would come to live at home , others would come for school fees or some were domestic workers . If my mum found a worker to be bright enough to go to school , my mum would take him or her to school . They are a lot of people whom she took to school and some went up to secondary yet they started as domestic workers at home . Saying everything about her would take ages ; all I know is that she was a very wonderful parent .

We decided we were no longer going to run . We used to run because we were at home ; we knew the hiding places , and the best bushes . But then , we did n't know the place . The place where we were going was new to us . And we did not know where to run and hide . We decided not to run even if we met the attackers . We decided to fight for our lives . And even if we all died and there remained only one of us , that person was asked to die like a man ; fighting for his life .

Then after ... I will be brief . MINUAR came . They wanted to take people who wanted to go to the area controlled by RPF . MINUAR started by Mille Collines . We were carried in about two rounds . However Interahamwe could stop people at times but things ceased after on the date I do not remember well . It was probably on June 15th when MINUAR came . Meanwhile , they gave us a conference and told us they would come to take us .

Actually ... you 'd ... I do n't think they should even be imprisoned . I think they should die ... they should just die , they should be sentenced to death . But if almost all of them did that , what 's the point of imprisoning ? They should let them free so they can be seeing us on the streets ; they thought we would be wiped out ! They thought their children would be asking what a Tutsi was looking like . Let them see us ! One thing that hurts me is seeing a survivor becoming an alcoholic . We should n't turn into alcoholics or get discouraged . On the contrary , what happened should be a reason for us to stand up and develop ourselves as much as possible for those who have the means to attain that development and those who do not have comfortable life , they could approach their friends ... that 's all I can think of .

But I remember some time when Sebuningo Oswald ; he was the representative of the party in Kibungo sector . He held a meeting at Kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto . But one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . And the whole meeting was about the "@ Hutu . @" Therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights . Thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide .

I was in the same bush till evening then I went back to Hélène 's house to ask her to hide me once again or to help me get someone else to hide me . Hélène told me that she did n't have anyone or anywhere to send me to and that I was betrayed the day her own sister chased me out of her home . She said if her sister had kept me in her house , no one would have ever known my tribe . Then she said she was going to ask Thérèse to hide me yet again . Thérèse told her she could n't as her own mother was a Tutsi and her mom had her with a Congolese man and everyone knew that . Her other siblings had Tutsi fathers . She said she could n't take me in because if they found me in her house , they 'd kill us all . I went to Mama Olivier 's home , that 's where Hélène took me but again Mama Olivier was waiting for them to come and kill her as she was also a Tutsi .

We started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools .

It is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that . I have had the grace of knowing God and I know He can do anything ! I would therefore tell the survivors that it is God who protected them during the wat , nobody else did ! I would invite them to live a prayerful life because without Him , no one would be where they are at today . Through prayer we find a certain peace that helps us to accept what happened and we understand that it had to happen that way . And also that God is not unaware of what is happening to us . But it 's only when one undertands the importance of prayer that we can be able to reach such a conclusion . On the other hand , orphans are confronted to various problems , they are n't stable and ... they do not understand that things come and go . Some of them behave very badly without realizing where the money for the education comes from . They do not ask themselves how things would be if they were n't the way they are . It is very clear that some students are n't serious about their school work at all and yet it should be their number 1 priority . My message for them is to be aware that they are orphans and that they should n't so much count on the families with which they live . Whatever they do , they should n't forget that they are orphans ! They should n't forget where they are coming from because the moment one recalls where they are coming from , their behaviour gets better .

Ngewe kuba naracitse ku icumu , usibye ko ari n' amahirwe ariko ubundi ni n' inshingano . Mbibona mo inshingano kuko abacitse ku icumu benshi , badafite uko bameze . Abakeya muri bo bakaba aribo bifite , bashoboye no kugira icyo bigezaho ku byerekeye no gutunga ubuzima ndavuga nk' ibyo kurya nibyo ... mbese n' ubuzima bw' ibanze ababufite ni bakeya . Ni inshingano rero cyane , z' ababufite , ubwo ubuzima bw' ibanze kubusangira n' abatabufite . Mvuga ko arero amahirwe...kuko iyo urebye ibyabaye mu Rwanda , ukareba n' ingufu byari bifite n' abari babirimo ; ari leta y' u Rwanda ; ari leta z' ahandi , kandi z' ibihugu by' ibihangange nk' ubufaransa . Wabonaga yuko kugirango umuntu asaguke byari bigoye cyane . Numvaga rero kuba uwacitse ku icumu n' amahirwe kandi ni n' inshingano zikomeye . ||| Personally I believe having survived ... Being a survivor is luck yes but it is also a big responsibility . I look at it as responsibility because many of the survivors are very poor and do not even have the least necessary for life [ food and a shelter ] . That 's why those who have something to share need to feel responsible for the ones who do not have anything . And I call it a privilege because when I consider what took place in Rwanda , with all the determination that was put in and when you consider all those who were fully motivated such as the Government of Rwanda or other Governments of powerful countries , like the French Government . We can easily say that it is a miracle that some people survived . Therefore , I believe that it is a privilege to be a survivor and I believe it is a big responsibility .

I am not a Pastor like my father but I do what I can . I love to sing and I lead some children in a choir . I do it because I guess there is a mission that God left me to complete in my remaining lifetime .

If they shared with them a little and let them eat their part they would n't have been refugees .

All I was avoiding was staying in that home . I saw how he would bribe them with a cow every time they came to his home , till when all the cows were finished . There had remained two cows , now the two cows were also taken . Therefore , since the cows are finished ... definitely he would not accept to remain with nothing . He also used to move ; I could not see him at home , he would come back in the evening . Ever , he would go and come back in the evening . I would say , "@ they will kill me next . @" but I would imagine how they killed the cows ... in fact that is the only reason why I never wanted to stay there . I would imagine it is would be same way they would kill me .

I did n't like living with my parents . I only wanted to live with my grandfather ; my grandfather was the person whose company I enjoyed the most . I reached an extent of refusing to go to school just because I wanted to stay with my grandpa . I moved in with him and we lived together . When my parents realized that I did n't want to live with them , they let me go to my grandpa 's . I was happy because he had cattle and I would spend the whole day with him grazing the cows . Later , he started to narrate me stories of the past . Sometimes he would give me examples of some of our neighbours who were still alive . He told me how in 1959 they would come and loot their properties ; take their cows , kill them ... kill their cows , sometimes eat them or take the rest . But during those days they did n't used to kill people , it was rare . He used to tell it to me live ... ! He also gave me another example of a man called Nshaka who was our neighbour and I think he was arrested after the war and released because he was aged . There were other children at grandpa 's ; they were his sister 's grandchildren . Therefore , they were his grandchildren too . They are the ones we used to be together . Only one of them survived , the rest died . We used to play together on the streets . What I talked about is my life before the war . I did n't know much , I was simply interested in grazing cows , eating and playing on the streets .

It was becoming bright and morning was coming then my brother Rudahunga Michael saw me and he came towards me . He asked me , "@ How are you ! I thought they killed you , how did you escape them ? @" I started telling him what had happened but he stopped me because it was a long story . He took me to a man called Nzaramba whose wife was called Mujawimana Françoise , she worked at a certain hospital ; she was an assistant nurse . I spent there about three nights and she warmed water and washed me . She treated the injury that I had . I spent about three days there .

In our areas ... most of them still do n't believe what they did was wrong an dhaven't come out in the open to tell the truth . I went there after the war and they told mehow my family was killed and who killed them . But when people started being arrested and the lawsuits started , they refused to testify . And when we would ask them about the previous times they said it , they 'd say they never said it . Some got arrested but others were never arrested . For example , among the children who killed Ngirabakunzi - one was mature enough - do you believe a 12 or 15 year old person who kills is still a child ? They arrested him and released him later on saying he is mentally disturbed , but I also think they released him because he was a child . But even the rest of the people who killed my family or neighbours were never arrested and those who were have been released . If I had known that they were going to release them , I would n't have wasted my time pursuing them . I would just have let them go . I would have let them go because this should be the time when ... they should be shameful of their deeds ... but when I see them , I am the one who is ashamed because they killed my family and others as well . Today I see them and I remember how I pursued them , wanting them to be arrested and I feel ashamed . I see them and I am so dishonored I could hide myself or I wish I could move to a place where I would n't be seeing them anymore ! It 's so shocking to run after somebody who killed your people so they can be imprisoned and then see them released ! Had I known it was going to be that way , I would n't have gotten involved .

I will tell you old the events , which took place in the last week or I will begin from the death of Gatabazi and Bucyana , who was a CDR member . That is when we started getting many problems . That is when many people ( the Tutsi ) were killed . They used to get young boys who would be going to their homes and take their clothes off and force them to wear combat and Boots . They would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them Inkotanyi , yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well .

Because before the genocide things were the other way round ; everything in life was like milk and honey . But after the genocide until today , one can believe ... in most cases , the citizens still depend on the Government . When I consider today 's leadership , I can say that their aim is to bring people together and stop divisions . They want to unite people . Therefore , the future will be good to many people . But I would n't want to ignore that some people will still find the future so disappointing ... because they were left with diseases , there are some children who never went to school yet they were able to study . But to me , the future will be better than the past [ I mean straight after the genocide ] . Because one had not yet defined the right path to go through . Personally I was lucky . I am educated ; I completed my secondary school and I have now completed university . And now I see that ... Well , of course life is not totally based on education but I guess there is much I thought I would never be able to achieve that I have achieved , which I am glad I did . I guess the rest will go according to God 's plan and personally . I will emphasize on the fact that in many ways , people 's lives are dependent on the leadership . People died due to a bad Government . If the government had done the right thing , people would n't have died . Thanks to the plan that today 's Government 's has , many people have the hope of living and this reassures me that the future will be good . I am not forgetting that some people will have a bad life in the future . I am not saying that things will be like milk and honey [ a good life ] for all people . I always think about people who were infected with HIV @/@ AIDS during the genocide ... very young kids who were two or three years old then who never experienced parental care . Today they are not well cattered for in orphanages . Others live on the streets , they are cattered for by passers @-@ by . They move from house to house . I think that may have some negative impact on their future lives . I guess I was lucky because I got a chance of having parents and they prepared me . And now I guess I have a foundation . I tend to think that I will never have to face plenty of problems [ as I did in the past ] to be sincere .

I always follow most of Gacaca justice in our area but there is one thing that hurts me . The Gacaca justice started well , people were learning how it is done and after , it became corrupted . People started to get bribes in order to drop charges . There is a rule that states @: "@ When a decision does not satisfy the congress of Inyangamugayo [ Honest people ] , they have to vote and the majority wins . @" When it 's a case of releasing a person , even the minority has to sign too for that release . It is remarkable especially in our area , there is a trial that has to be repeated because one man was claimed by ten survivors and nothing was done . We were really sure about the crime this man committed but still he was sent free . The survivors sworn to never claim anyone else because their testimonies are useless .
Kuko kuba bonyine batabyikuriye mu mutima wabo ngo babikureyo kubera ko babibwiwe n' umutima wabo , ni ukuvuga ngo ejo , ejo bashobora kongera kabikora .

Ni ukuvuga ngo niba bo bonyine batavuze ngo twakoze nabi twica abaturanyi , twica abantu twasaga nk' aho tuva inda imwe , ntacyo tubaziza , none koko reka dusabe imbabazi ; ni ukuvuga ngo ntaho bava ntaho bajya ejo bazongera babikore . ||| The fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again . Are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ? It was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 . Meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong . So , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again .

I only stayed there for 3 days and then she asked one of her neighbours to kindly keep me because Mama Olivier herself was being hunted and they 'd certainly kill her if they found me in her house . She then took me to her friend 's home . I was there for about 2 days ... Hélène kept on pleading with Thérèse and she finally agreed to take me in with her again . By then , people in Rugunga had all been killed . Later on , the Inkotanyis kept on fighting and fighting . When they reached a place called Imburabuturo , people had toleave their homes for sometime . But when they came back to their homes , Thérèse told me that she was going to lock me in and if she ever came back , she would not keep me with her because things were really be bad then , she explained that they could even come on the next day searching in her house and find me there . I remember Hélène begging her to keep me with her and she said she had already helped me a lot despite the fact that she did n't know me and she could n't continue risking her life for me . She said she expected them to come soon and kill her siblings and her mother and she believed they 'd kill her as well .

He asked , "@ Why did you get that girl to sit there ? @" He replied to him that I was an Inyenzi . He was like , "@ You guys are actually killing everyone on the pretext that they are Inyenzis ! @" His reply was that what he meant was that I was a Tutsi and that they were expecting a car from Nyamirambo that will be having Tutsis in it and I would go with them .

Immediately they found out that we would hide and come back to sleep , a very big group of killers came , the people who were in that attack were our neighbours , we were living in the same cell . They came and shouted . They surrounded the whole house and soon after all doors were open . Dad slammed the door and locked it , they hit it hard and it fell inside ... I had a sister who had been born lame . Dad asked her if he could carry her , but she refused . And when she refused ... They had ordered us all to get out and while dad was still arguing with them , they beat him up and he just carried the kid on his shoulders . I was holding a mattress on the head , when they started pushing us forward , saying they were taking us to kill us with others . They asked us to choose between putting us in a bus and taking us to Arusha . That is what I heard but I did n't understand which bus they were talking about . I thought it was a normal bus but I checked around and I did n't see any . Well as they were still talking , putting people in front , I slightly bent . I was very small , it seemed like I was sleeping under the mattress . Then , I sneaked away and left the mattress there . They thought I was under the mattress . I went and hid in the bushes around and when they checked below the mattress , they did n't see anyone . However , they did not mind much about it , they just got confused and left . Until today , I do n't know how they were killed .

Kayibanda , if am not mistaken , his father was Nkangura who came from Bukavu and he even came with his brother ; basically there were two men one called Nkangura and his brother the father to Rwagasana . They came this side during the time of King Musinga and they became servants and even Nkangura , the dad of Kayibanda became a servant of a man called Birasabyakanyemera , chief Birasa was still a young man . He became his servant and he served him , he served him when he was in Nyanza school . After Birasa took his portion in Kamonyi , he came with Nkangura over there . I think that 's when Kayibanda was born .

They came down the hill still playing the Makondera . This time they brought some things I could n't identify ; they were holding things burning with flames . That was so scary . Those flames looked like the torches that are always lighted when a team wins a match . The attacker were holding these flames while wearing banana leaves , I was a young boy who used to like joining others on the field . I would carry stones and we met them in the swamp and fought ; we shot each other until when they were forced to run back while no one had been killed in our group . On the third day , that is when they realised that we were serious . Therefore , they came down the hill like they used to and we too did the same as it had become the routine . Inside our hearts we were confident that we shall conquer them . We had decided never to let Interahamwe kill us cruelly . So they tricked us by coming down the usual way and very close . Then we started shooting arrows as we used to do and all of a sudden , we heard them shouting with guns .

I never knew who it was . And the reason why I did know him , in Ntarama several people gathered there ... To be sincere , they were very many and I guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there Identity cards for one to tell who was who . Well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the ID to know who was who or where he was coming from . The main theem was killing . And our motto was to finish the ethenic of Tutsi ... looking for Ids by then , was nosense . Point was in killing only because that was the deal .

I tried to take her out of it too and removed the piece of cloth that was tied on her . I tried to make her stand but she could n't because these bones [ he shows ] were crashed . She was screaming a lot ! I imagined ; "@ Someone screaming like this yet naked , no joints , the knee bones are crashed , nothing ... @" All her bones were crashed . I left her because I could see she had no life yet I was also dying myself . Then I started fighting to get out of the pit . It was a circular shaped pit and when I was almost reaching the top I slipped and fell back into the pit . I again tried to come out ; I stepped on the bricks that they had thrown in the pit and in the bricks , there was a stick pointing up . Therefore , I got support from that stick and came out . There was another stick that was hanging across the pit , I held it and finally got a way out of the pit . But when I fell back in the latrine for the second time , it was because all my clothes were wet . Therefore , I removed everything and remained only in my underwear .

Sometimes they would stop and abuse me . Then I decided to stop and go back where we were coming from . I said to myself "@ there is no difference I may still die . Even though I go keep going with these perpetrators , they may reach some where and kill me , I can not change much to my fate . @" I used to fetch water . One day , as I was planning to go fetch water , Abayi came and told me ; "@ Alice , Get out ! @" I went out . Then he said , "@ I know you very well , you are a Tutsi . You will not continue to stress us out for so long . I was suggesting we kill you and then we proceed our journey without you . @" I knew there was nothing to lie about because it was true , he knew me . Therefore , I simply kept quiet . But my hands were swollen and then he asked me , "@ What happened to your hands ? @" I told him that I was grinding maize grains and then developed corns in my hands , which turned to be boils and later on the boils busted . Then he told some men to take me and kill me . But there was a dispute among those men because they could n't decide who would kill me . That was in Rusatira . One of them told me to go after that .

I do n't know what he used to do somewhere he would go and come back after a couple of days . She would time when the husband would be away and then torture me horribly .

By then my injury was getting better and the swelling was reducing . Therefore I crossed the river and went there . But instead of going to Mr. Ndongozi 's home , I went to his young brother 's home . He was called Ndanga Aloys and he was my dad 's friend ; him and my father had given each other cows . [ In the Rwandan culture , giving a cow to a person is a symbol of friendship and solidarity ] . However , I doubted if they would accept to hide me or if they would kill me . Fortunately they welcomed me in their home and I stayed there until ... it was towards the end of May . I stayed there and left the place when the whole family was preparing to flee . When the Inkotanyi captured Kabgayi ; that was on the 2nd of June in 1994 . They all fled . Then they asked me , "@ We are preparing to flee , should we live you in the house ? @"

By then several people had reached at home because ; we lived well somewhere like ... as one could be living over there ... it is a place called Kayenzi ; when you are crossing towards Nyamata . By then they had n't attacked us ; they could just pass by crossing over to Nyamata . So they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there . They decided to try there . My uncles and aunts with other neighbours were living across the valley so they came and scattered themselves in the neighbouring houses . They would spend one or two days then things would worsen again . One day , I do n't remember which day but it had been two weeks since we were in that situation and the Interahamwe [ perpetrators ] had finished all people in Nyamata . They had killed people in Kayumba forest and killed everyone who was in church . They had killed everywhere else and the next place was my home village . I remember some people saying , "@ The attackers have come through the coffee plantation @"@ , which was slightly below our home . So I was wondering , I could n't imagine things such as killings , I though they were impossible . People were screaming , "@ They have come . @" And then they took off to the Ntarama church through the forest . Those who were still able to defend themselves with bows and spears fought them . At times they were able to defeat the Interahamwe and they would get a rest and go back home . The Interahamwe realized that they were not going to defeat the resistors with no guns . They said there were certainly ‘ Inyenzi ’ among them [ the resistors ] . While fleeing , the resistors used to try and fight back the Interahamwe but they started loosing courage as they were seeing about ten , twenty of them being killed , they started scattering . The strong guys fled towards Gitarama and Kabwayi , there remained very few and helpless people .

I said to myself , "@ If it is so , let me go . @" But I could n't recall the path because I had passed there only once together with my family . I simply used to guess . I would look at a hill in front of me and guess that if I reached the place , perhaps I would be in such and such area . I was looking for a way to survive . I would not cross roadblocks ; I would avoid them . Whenever I met somebody , I got information from him or her about the situation . When someone told me that it was dangerous then , I would go through bushes . Afterwards I decided not to reach home , because if I reached home , they would kill me the way they killed dad and maybe even my mom . I thus made up my mind to look for a job . The first person I met was a lady and she told me that she could n't hire such a person . She could n't give a job to a person who looked like me .

So the colonialists came here with priests and all the archaeologists and wrote the lengthy history of the colonialist which you all know .

To us it seemed like the war had started . But in reality , it had only started in Nyamata , Kayumba and on the side of Maranyundo . Ntarama , my home village , was only attacked later on , compared to the other villages in that area . People from Nyamata were fleeing to the families in Ntarama because perpetrators had not yet reached there ; I mean the strong perpetrators . It was only the Hutu perpetrators in the neighbourhood that were killing then . People started fleeing and hiding in churches as it used to be in 1992 expecting it to be the same . On their way they would meet others fleeing from the same place . Some would change their direction and go back with them , while others would ask , “ Where are you going ? ” The other group would reply , “ It 's hell there . We are fleeing . They have burnt the whole area . ” Therefore , some would go back while other would go ahead .

If not I do n't see where this unity and reconciliation will come from . There is this thing of asking forgiveness between each other and I find it bad . What are we going to ask forgiveness for ? It is because they killed us ! I hear some leaders insisting that we should say sorry as if is there any fault we committed . You hear them saying that they are going to give us indemnity because we do need it . Let me tell you that there is no indemnity that can replace a human . It should not even be called indemnity ; it should be called compensation or another name . They should find a way so the old men and women , and those wounded people could live . They should maintain the security of Genocide survivors . It is sad people are killed in the day time , this happened in Kabuga . In kaduha , it is also the same . You hear a person was sent to prison , but during the visiting days they take for him meat , tea , and other nice things . You find that he struggles only from Monday to Thursday , but he lives nicely on Friday like the way he lived while he is outside .

Near their home , the river was approximately there [ she 's pointing ] and they were living somewhere like here [ as she 's pointing ] . Near the swamp . Then I said to myself ; "@ I am going to throw myself in this river . @" I threw myself in the river and simply drunk some water and found myself the other side of the river . When I was young , I used to hear that when you commit suicide and you have money , you can never die . I had 1000Rfw in my pocket . "@ Maybe it is the reason why I can not die . @" I thought . Then I put that money aside and then went back into the river . I still did not die . Then I left the river . That is how I left that man 's home . He was called Kayigamba .

We grew up until the 1990s...in 1992 in Bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the Hutu were burning the Tutsi 's properties . By then we resided in Ntarama , which was out of [ Ntarama ] town . So it started from the side of Ngenda and Gashora because many Hutus resided in those areas . The area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration . It was a place where they used to take all the Tutsis who had migrated . They used to construct houses close to each other ; the Tutsi , neighbouring each other in that area , inhabited almost all houses .

And things would shake with these bracelets and they would run . They ran and they called the Interahamwe and presidential guards . One presidential guard came in saying that they wanted medicine ; I asked them what Kind of medicine do you want ? They told me the medicine they wanted , I went and got it for them . I had prepared porridge I gave them and we drank and then I told them , what if I opened the door will you look inside ? They said yes , I opened the door and I asked them do you see any person in here ? They said no , then why do go telling people that I have people in here , as an old woman you think I can hide someone ? Can I know how to hide a child or a woman ? I thought that If I said a man they would suspect it so I did n't say it instead I said children and women . So I said I will send you an animal and beasts to eat you .

He also used to tell me to take interest in his things and to take care of my sisters .

We started our journey at around seven o'clock in the evening . In our plans , we wanted to go through Kajevuba because there was a way that leads to Ririma . Then from that road we would take either Gashora or Ngenda . But when we were about to reach Nyamata , we heard a group of people coming down from Kayumba , they had goats , and we heard voices from so many people , we immediately hid in the bush near that road . We could hear them saying , "@ I got a nice bed from the house of so and so . @" They were carrying beds , basins , and goats ; in fact I remember a goat tried to graze at a bush where we were hiding , and I was afraid they would see us but it was at night and it was dark . So , they could not see us . Somebody pulled the goat and fortunately the whole group passed without seeing us . We stood up and walked to Kajevuba . It was by God 's will that we were not killed throughout the way . Then we continued that road up to a place called Karera near Gashora .

Ni...ni ikibazo gikomeye . Kuko kubabarira umuntu , ubwa mbere na mbere ugomba kubanza ukamenya uwo ari we . Kuko ntiwababarira umuntu utagusabye imbabazi .

Ugomba kumenya umuntu ku izina rye uti kanaka yankoreye ibi ariko ndamubabariye . Kandi nk' umukristo nanjye nzi ko bavuga ngo mujye mubabarira abantu ibyaha babakorera kuko nanjye ubyo munkorera ndabibabarira .

Njye numva ari uko nabivuga ariko yabivuze . Kuko ntabwo watanga imbabazi ngo uvuge ngo ndababariye bande se ? Mpanya ndetse ko aricyo kintu tubura muri iki gihugu cyacu cyo mu Rwanda .

Ariko ubundi nibyo byari byiza . ||| It is a very tough question . Because , for one to be able to forgive , you first of all need to know whom you 're forgiving , you can not forgive if no one asks you to forgive him or her or when you do n't know who it is you 're forgiving . Or maybe when nobody has come to ask for forgiveness so that you can at least acknowledge that they were going through some sort of madness . The word "@ forgiveness @" is a tough one . But I believe if someone would come to me and say , "@ I betrayed you , I murdered your wife , I murdered your kids @"@ , I would forgive them . I 'd also become a murderer if I killed them . I would truly forgive them but the question is who to forgive . Who is it ? Not all Hutus killed . Therefore you can not say that you 're forgiving the Hutus . You need to know who did it and then be able to say that , so and so did this to me but I forgive him or her . As a Christian I know it is written , "@ forgive others as I forgive you . @" Therefore , as a believer I truly believe it is possible to forgive but you ought to know whom you are forgiving . So if they came before me and asked me to forgive them , I could do it . That 's the way I can put it . But the condition is that they would say it . You can not forgive in general . Who is it you 're forgiving ? I think that is what we lack here in Rwanda , that someone would come and acknowledge that they betrayed you , that they killed your people . If it were the case , people would forgive . Very few people acknowledge what they did and you wonder if these people killed themselves , if they just happened to die . It is so obvious when you compare the number of the victims to the number of those who acknowledge being the perpetrators of the genocide . The same people who were our neighbours . I 'll give you the example of one of my neighbours called Simbizi , there was one house between his and mine . We had known each other for a long time . When they arrested him they asked me to come and identify him . When I got there they asked him if he knew me , he said no ! You see how difficult it is ! Someone we used to live with and spend a lot of time with , his child used to come home and share meals with mine and he said he does n't know me and yet we were neighbours ! Despite the fact that we were neighbours , he said he did n't know me . That shows how much forgiveness will be difficult as long as Rwandans will not tell the truth about what they did . Otherwise , forgiveness is for sure the ideal thing to do .

We never knew their names or where they were coming from . The Interahamwe dumped her in the pit where she spent five days agonizing before dying . Later a certain man who was my neighbour ; he lived in the house close to ours . He got a very big stone and threw it to her in the pit and killed her finally .

We went to a certain place called Runda and then to a place called Gihinga . When we reached a certain roadblock , they stopped us . They asked mum to give them her identity card . But she did n't have one . Then they asked her ; "@ Whose kids are those ? @" she told them we were not her kids , that we were just walking together . They made her sit on a pit . We refused to leave her . We stayed there waiting for them to kill us , but they did n't . After sometime , a group of Interahamwe came . When they reached there , one of them said to the rest , "@ I know this old lady , she is not a Tutsi . @" That 's how we survived then and went on . I had a godmother in a certain place called Ruzege . Mum took me there , but when we got there , they said that they could not hide such a big number of people , that they would also be killed . But they allowed me to stay with them and asked mum and my sister to look for elsewhere to go . Therefore , they left and I stayed there . But we had other relatives in a place called Nyamiyaga in Musambira commune . When they reached there , they found they had all been killed . Mum immediately left for Kabgayi and my sister stayed there with other kids who were there and they hid together . After mum reached Kabgayi , we never got to know what happened to her ; I wonder if she died or if she 's still alive , but she most probably died . Since the war ended , we have never seen her . We do n't even know even know how she was killed ... neither where she died .

I think it 's a way of simplifying things . I do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be . We should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time . Some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail .

I would avoid using the main road and would go through the bushes instead . As I was walking I met some people whom were said to be the Inkotanyi . They were collecting children and that is how they got me too . Then we were taken to Butare . We lived there until when I started thinking "@ Well , I am here but how come none of my family members is here ? Does this mean no one survived to come and get me out of here ? @" I lived there for some time and then ... later I saw my cousins . They were younger than I was and they were on their own . Therefore , since there was no good life where I was living and yet at the same time my cousins were getting spoiled on the roads , I decided to leave the place and join them . I was the oldest , life became very hard on us . I started that life of being in charge of the whole family since I was the oldest . "@ I am now talking about life after the war . @" We went to a certain man called Papa Alisa . We told him , " As you can see how our home was destroyed . There is no house left . If you did us a favour and got us a shelter , it would be very meaningful to us . We are the only ones who survived , we will never burden you as far as food and other needs are concerned . If you got us shelter , it would be of great help to us . We shall look for means to get food by ourselves . @"

That is what I 'd call it . He would organize us and walk ahead of us . Whenever he could hear the attackers coming up the hill , he would let us know and we would escape , running towards where the Interahamwe were coming from ; in a way that we would go behind the Interahamwe . Sometimes they would see us but we could run . By then we were four from the same family . One day three of us were hiding and the older cousin had hid somewhere else . I remember a group of attackers discovered us . Some people ... a family of Interahamwe , a man with two wives and very many sons and daughters . In fact his children were grown ups [ the man was old by then ] . This man 's children had called themselves ‘ Abandagaye ’ because they were very many . [ Meaning the irresponsible ones ] . His children had made their own group of attackers , and in case they caught you , you would simply say goodbye to your beloved ones . Because they never would let you go . They could hunt a person until they got him or her . Therefore , three of us were hiding together and ‘ Abandagaye ’ found us out ; this is when I realized God was with us . My youngest cousin swiftly run and they did saw him . But that group ambushed my other cousin and me . Two of the attackers were slightly behind us and two others ahead . So , what happened ; my older cousin jumped out of where his hiding place and ran down the hill towards the valley . Then the attackers followed him , thinking that all the people who were hiding had run to the valley . When I saw that , I ran back to where the attackers came from . They ran after him . He was caught and killed . "@ May his soul rest in eternal peace . @" That is what I can say .

They put something which seemed like their hand that was always there . They looked for something the Belgians seemed to have failed at , that is how I view it . But the French people worked together with Habyarimana and even others . Truly French people , the way it is , are wise who are generous . When Belgians granted independence it looked like they have given it out and nothing behind it but there would be something that would keep them around , they used the black leaders or the ones from Asia because there are leaders but they were still there too . Here and in Burundi and in Congo as well . Because Belgium is a small country when they granted it they meant it but the French were thought that you can n't just let them go just like that yet Congo has riches .

Then I told him that , "@ that is not the solution . I believe that , the answer to the problems I have now is death . Therefore , just kill me .

Something that really surprised me and made me wonder why people were so much against us is that one day Bibi went out , she used to walk around a lot . She met somebody who was dying of hunger . She brought him to us , the man was called Minani . We never used to get out . Bibi put the adults among us in charge of taking care of the injured and of the children . She brought the man called Minani and told me to take care of him . I approached him but he could n't talk as he was very hungry . I asked him his name and he said he was called Minani . I asked him where he was from and he told me he was a Burundian refugee , him and his family were being persecuted and he fled the war in Burundi . A few days later , when he started getting back some strength , he asked me how I got there and I told him I sought refuge there in an attempt to flee . He asked me if I was a Tutsi and I said "@ yes @"@ . His reply was that him on the other hand was Hutu and the fact that we had met in such a place was probably God 's way of showing us how we really have no reason to fight and that at the end of the day , we are all the same .

But I do so and I do it with all my strength because it needs to be done . So that even the people who want them to be forgotten will have failed . I think the day the project is completed it will have a lot of impact . It is very helpful even to us . The day you will want to remember your friends or your family , you will be able to go there . That 's why I give myself fully to that project because it will be of great help . It will even show the International Community that the genocide actually happened .

Let 's say you have a wife and you quarrel frequently ; you quarrel once , twice , three times and finally you fight . And maybe she hits you with a burning charcoal or you hit her toot . That can stick in your mind maybe because it is what hurts you the most in the whole fight . Now , comparing that example to this situation . You came to Murambi , is n't it ? So tell me among all the horrible things you did or saw , what do you remember ... something that stuck in your head ? Maybe a memory about hacking somebody or somebody you saw being crushed by a grenade . That is all we need to know . An incident that you will never forget .

Do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ? Anything you may need to talk about to Rwandans at large or survivors in general . You can say anything ...
Iterambere...ariko noneho iterambere rijyanye n' ubwiyunge , cyangwa se kumvikana hagati y' abantu . Nyuma y' ibyo ngibyo ni ukwihanganirana . Kuko urabona nk' urugero nk' iyo bavuga ngo inkiko gacaca , ushobora kuvuga uti @: "@ abantu barishwe , abandi babura uko babashinja , cyangwa ababashinje barwaye sida barimo no gupfa . Noneho bakazavuga bati @: "@ uyu ntafite umushinja afungurwe . @" Ariko yenda mu murenge hari undi azasanga ku gitanda , arwaye cyangwa ameze ate ... utabonye uburyo bwo kumushinja . Ubwo niba afite umutima w' ubwiyunge bigezweho hagati ye n' uwo muntu ufunguwe mbona iterambere ry' u Rwanda , u Rwanda ruzaba rutera imbere , kuko nta rwikekwe ruzaba ruhari . ||| Development ... But again , development goes hand in hand with unity or with understanding among the people . And then there needs to be tolerance among the people . Because , let 's take the example of the Gacaca jurisdictions , some people were killed , others were charged of murder and maybe the ones accusing them are dying of AIDS ; maybe some of them will be released because there will n't be anyone to charge them . But maybe somewhere in the village , there will be someone else in their deathbed who was unable to go and accuse him . If the charged man really has it at heart to be united with the people he wronged , then he can make a step towards that person and work it out himself . That way , I believe Rwanda will develop because there will n't be any suspicion in the hearts of the people .
Naragiye njya kwa Jean njyana na Mélanie , noneho niho nabonye ko birangiye . Niho nari ntangiye kubona abantu bapfuye , bari bishe abantu bose , bari bishe abana bose babamaze .

For the first time , I saw people who had been killed , everyone had been killed , even the children had been killed . I remember an 8 year old child who was laying next to his or her mother , I then understood that it was over . We got inside the house looking for something we could use to cover them but there 's nothing as everything had been looted . We left Jean 's house ... Mélanie was very scared , she told me she was n't sure she 'd survive or if I would neither . She asked me she wanted me to choose among her many clothes the ones I liked when we get home , she said I could wear them if I happened to survive . I laugh at myself whenever I remember that because when we got to Maria 's house , I went among her clothes and chose the nice ones and tied them into a shirt and we left . We went to a quarry that was in Rugunga . We used paths between houses and we passed dead bodies all over the place . Mélanie was a lot more afraid than I was . I felt I was strong . We went and sat there .

So you can understand who wanted it . Who are those who wanted it ? they are SDR members , in real sense they are the ones who wanted all that in all times the ones who were behind him , who actually helped him were colonialists .

So let 's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by French long ago . it 's like they replaced Belgians so that they do n't just let us go . It 's as if they replaced them yet they had n't agreed on it . They did n't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that . Actually whenever we disagree with the French , Belgians do n't mind it , it makes them come back saying they got they took their place . I guess that 's how I understand , it I did n't really think much about it . Belgians left but the French refused since they did not go anywhere at all , instead they said this time since Belgians are leaving . Let 's put that little thing back in our pockets . Basically the francophone 's . They told Habyarimana that first all you are still young , it 's French language now .

Then when I refused to stay , they tried to hold me [ to stop me from leaving ] and I hit the door open and I left . Immediately I hid behind the houses . But when someone is meant to die or if death is on the way , it is very hard to think straight . While I was behind the house , I decided to join others at Nyamata commune or church . Other refugees [ Tutsi ] had already left ; it was only I left behind . I waited for the situation to calm down and then later I walked slowly with my spatula without fear in order to give people the impression that I am an Nterahamwe . I looked very serious and passed behind the houses . No one talked about me , I just walked firmly and reached a place called Kajevuba formally , it was known as Gatare . Through Gatare one just ascends the hill and reaches the commune . I was trying to get to the commune . Before I reached the commune , I saw a roadblock just ahead of me . At the roadblock there was a policeman . Normally during the days before the war , policemen used to have wooden guns , but that policeman had a scary gun .

That distressed Musinga because they insulted him and told him that he worshiped idols but a wise man like Musinga could not accept this , I wanted to say that they kept the truth from him because he could not accept this and even his son merely took it because he believed that if he did not accept it he would end up like his father

The situation never improved , the Hutus continued to mistreat the Tutsis . Untill that period between 1980 and 1988 when Tutsis were menaced so much by the Hutus in areas like Bugesera and Kibirira . Generally , the Hutus continued to torture the Tutsis . Then in 1990 when the Ikontanyi [ RPF army ] invaded the country , Tutsis were subjected to serious torture ; they were killed , imprisoned accused of being traitors , others were killed , houses were burnt in all those areas of Kibirira , Bugesera and in the Bagogwe in Ruhengeri . This continued up to 1994 when Habyarima 's airplane crashed on its way from Tanzania . Then they started killing the Tutsis with all their effort saying that Tutsis were responsible for habyarima 's death . "@ Therefore , they [ Tutsis ] have to pay for it , " they said . With the help of soldiers together with the Interahamwe who had been given enough training in Bugesera and Mutara , they were trained posible methods of killing people . Then Tutsis died , they were killed ... these were the Tutsis being killed . And it was one clan killing the other .

I remember there is a time I joined vocational training that was organized by FARG . There was a lecture on reconciliation . I could n't attend it . In fact I almost got a trauma attack and walked out . There were other students who also rejected it , and finally they decided to stop the lecture . They reported that we disliked the lecture about reconciliation . Personally I do n't believe in reconciliation and forgiveness . Because I believe that in order to forgive somebody , he or she has to first confess that he @/@ she killed and he @/@ she should narrate the whole story in details without telling lies . Otherwise , most people accept their crimes for the sake of getting their sentence reduced . I can n't believe in reconciliation ... Take the example of the old man called Nshaka ; when I was young , I was told about his deeds back in 1973 . And then recently I witnessed him doing the same things . How can you ever reconcile with such a person ? Because it is very clear that whenever he is with his children , he is teaching them how Tutsis are bad . That is why I never think about reconciliation in my life .

Therefore , they cut the cabble that used to supply up to this place . Frankly speaking , I can not clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time , there were no electric phones . At least they would have disconnected the communication system and leave the electricity . Then in the morning we heard that the president died . We got the rumours from the neighbours because we could n't listen to the radio because we had no electricity . They had started burning people 's houses and killing people .

What I can add on , I would first go back to the case of the survivors especially the youth because the old ones are too miserable to listen to this . But young people especially the survivors I would give them my testimony saying that , "@ They should never despair . @" We can not change the past . I am not saying that we forget and reconciliate . But we should not be taken up by out past . But it does n't mean that we should forget the genocide , instead we should always think about it because it makes us strong . Remembering gives us power to fight against any other thing that would ever cause another genocide in Rwanda . We are the ones to give genocide its value . If we do n't value it , no one else will . If we do n't give out these testimonies , no one else will give them out . If we do n't fight for the construction of memorial sites , no one will ever stand up for their constuction . It is our task to stand up for our rights . We should get our freedom of living . To live again . This is the testimony I can give to the youth survivors . Thanks .

In the following class we would be ten but now they will call and it will be only me . And so they will start saying that , "@ we study with only one Tusti . @" So it would bother me but I would try to avoid such thoughts because it was the only life I had to lead . I knew my life was school life . I had to complete primary school and pass it well so that I would get a school where I would live always . And I would stop living in outside families . I would go to a school where I would stay and live with people I never knew . I started aiming at that goal and I felt like it was the best one .

Iyaba aribyo iyi leta y' ubumwe iriho yari gufata uwishe nawe akicwa , ariko siko byagenze ahubwo byabaye ngombwa ko uzi ikintu akivuga akagitangaho n' ubuhamya .

Up to this moment in my document I mentioned so many Rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed . Some of them are out there and I remember them . When they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily . "@ Though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did . He is lucky he was released . @" That is what they say . One can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . And it is true their time will come and they will be put in open . Because I will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . I do n't intend to hide the Genocide . Therefore , those who are still out there , I would like to remind them that Gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime . Those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . But they should also have the courage to say the truth . Saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed . If it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true . Instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did . Therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only . There is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth . So , you killed some one you better say it . Because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the Genocide .

That is the first thing I would warn him about . I would explain to him that the reason he does n't have grandparents , is because of the hatred somepeople developed towards others . I would tell him how there once were conflicts between two ethnic groups and as a result , people hated one another and killed each other .

There used to be bamboo just near the market . I saw that it was Boniface with his wife that they were taking . They took them to the bamboo and there was a roadblock . They said , "@ we could n't find this man during the time of traitors . Now what kind of death should he die ? @" I was watching every step in a distance . But I would n't believe it ; those acts were beyond my imagination . They used to have spears though they never used them to kill people . They would use sharpened bamboo ; they would sharpen it till when it appears like a spear yet it was a stick . They would display them on a line as if they were on sell . Everyone who would pass there , yet he or she was among a group of attackers . He would take one as he wished .

Even right now as I am talking , there are some information that I skip , because there is much that I forgot . Even writing was n't easy ; there were some information I wrote and sent it to Mudende [ Adventist 's University ] . The first day I wrote two pages , hoping to add on the following day . When I sat the following day to continue , I had a lot to write but it was not flowing in order . Therefore , I decided to leave everything and get a whole day to prepare it . That day I wrote eight pages . And from that day on , it is when I started talking about it ... writing about it . And the reason as to why I was trying to do this is because at the trauma center they had advised that in order to overcome it I must try and talk it out or even cry . But in my whole life I have never cried . Instead of crying , I can n't talk . Whenever we go to Gisozi , while others cry , I just can n't talk anymore . That is why whenever I go there ; I get someone I can keep talking to in order to avoid loosing my speech . But still I find myself quiet .

They say that there was a priest for the Tutsi and a priest for the Hutu but they did what they felt like , that is what I always say . I heard them say that in the time of father Peraudin , he was told by the colonialists that the Rwandans were going to gain independence and the Tutsi had been removed , like you see it 's over so chose to help Tutsis , rather help the Hutu and leave out the Tutsi .

The message I would like to give as I said from the beginning is a message of love , everyone needs to love their neighbour wherever they are . I am convinced that if everyone had shown love for one another , what happened would never have happened . No father would have killed his own children ! There was no love at all during genocide . Everyone is supposed to love their neighbour as they love themselves . I know it is not easy but at least we should make some effort ! Because when you love your neighbour as you love yourself , you will never think of killing him or her or of making him or her into an orphan but you will have compassion for them instead . You would want to put yourself in their shoes , you would think of a situation where you get sick and there 's nobody to take care of you ... So all I am asking is that people love their neighbour as themselves . It is very difficult especially for orphans and for those who lost their loved ones ... it is very difficultn for someone who is n't ‘ saved ’ to ... to understand that there 's nothing good in revenging . It is true that your people were killed but it is over ! I am not saying they should forget , I myself can not forget , it is something that will always be part of me . And when one remembers how it happened , it becomes ... depending on the period in which we are , things are the way they are . We should n't forget what happened because remembering , looking at where we are at today and being able to that despite everything , there 's some improvement . Because that period was part of another life . Today , we 're in another life . The life in which we were and today 's life ... We need to think about it but that 's not a reason to cnstantly live in the past without thinking of anything else . Yes , we need to remember , just like it is impossible to forget that we were born and that we shall die one day . But thinking about it ... we need to think about it with the intention to show gratitude to God for what He did , by looking at where you came from and where you are at today , gratitude for the fact that you have reached the time in which we are living today . I believe there 's nothing wrong with thinking about it as long as we are not living in the past . We need to think about it in the sense of ... yes , to think abou tit . And also to have love and to be able to forgive . Personally , I have completely forgiven them ! I have forgiven them because I know they did it because ... I know they did it ... but maybe as they say it themselves , they were only tools in the hands of someone else or some other power .

Kayibanda was given power by the Belgian colonialists . Kyibanda was there for some time then Habyarimana toppled him . Then the only thing I want here as someone who was there but when I look at this and the life in the genocide of 1994 , there is a way Kayibanda was given the power but he would rule with them but when Habyarimana come to power , when he toppled it . He had lived with French people . There are two things ; Belgians look like the people who created that thing of hatred among Rwandese , conflicts started and people started fighting each other .

In fact , some people were n't completely killed , they mutilated them and then left them to die of the wounds , after suffering greatly . They died a horrible death . What happened here is so atrocious ! It was terrible even if it 's not spoken about as much as the Nyanza and ETO @- Kicukiro events . There were dreadful scenes of atrocities here at Rubirizi ! Very few survived here ; when we consider the number of inhabitants of this sector or of the neighbouring ones , we realized that it 's very low compared to the number of the people who lived here before . Most of those who live here today are new . In addition , very few Interahamwes are in jail . The rest are probably in Congo . But some did surrender themselves ; the rest are not there anymore ... In fact , mostly the Kicukiro and Rubirizi inhabitants lost their lives here .

In the Carcuters that is where my mother lost her life . When Nsababera came back , he got a way to kill people . He respected my mother at a point he could not kill while my mother is watching him . As my mother was far from him , he got strength to kill people . We raised Nsababera as a child in the family . We used to call him Kajevuba [ New Comer ] because my mother did n't know his name . She used to call him Kajevuba . He took the spear and started to kill .

So , the counsellor advised us to go to the boarders between our sector and the neighboring sectors and prevent our sector from the Interahamwe who were coming in . There used to be few Hutu in our sector about two or three and they even left later on and joined other sectors . Then other Tutsi who were in other sectors came to our sector Kayumba . Therefore , Kayumba sector became a sector of Tutsi only . What came next is that we started patrolling at night in our sector . There was a clan in Kayumba sector , which was known as Abamere which I am a member of . This is a clan that used to own many cattle in the whole of Bugesera @-@ Kayumba . People in that clan used to be good at using bows and arrows . Therefore , we could guard our sector by moving around in our sector . At different boarder with other sectors , there was a swamp . This swamp separated our sector from other sectors . I remember I was young but I could carry a machete . We were told that one should carry whatever weapon they could get . Sometimes I could get stones and we could descend down the hill and patrol the whole night .

We then continued to move with my elder brother and the other small boy because he was a visitor in Kibuye and was quite young , I do n't know why they were n't taken with the men and other boys , they came to us and we left together . My mother said she there was a family friend called Visa , let 's go to his home , let 's see if they can shelter us because the Congolese were n't able , they had already left for their country .

They used to hide during the day in the swamp , and in the evening , after the Interahamwe 's leaving , my borther would bring me some sweet potatoes in a small bucket . But he would go back after because he never used to sleep in those houses . He used to sleep in another place called Bitera . After a few days , they left and never came back . But within a short time , there came a certain Interahamwe who used to work as a gardener at home doing part @-@ time jobs . He married a lady in the neighbourhood .

But days had passed ; it was around early June and they had remained with two cows . I stayed in that home after two days and nights , in a certain morning ... very early around 6:30 a.m. it was slightly dark though there was some kind of light . Then I had a group of attackers knocking on the door . "@ Munyagishari , in your house there are Gahizi 's children . And since they are here , we can not do anything before we wipe them away . And , in the whole of Gacaca , you are the only one remaining with people , all others died . @" they told that man ; Munyagishali . They were talking while standing outside the door . So , he took me behind the house . They started checking in the main house yet I was in the small house behind the big one . Later they left . "@ We shall come back in dawn while we can see clearly . You will n't lay to us anything . We shall look for her and in case we do n't see her ... we know you still have their cows . They will also be taken . @" They said .

Wait , killings at the commune have not yet started . @" Then I realised that people at the commune were going to die in the meantime . Then I told the policeman , "@ Okay , I will go back and wait . @" Then I understood the logic behind sending people to the commune . I went back but I was wondering were I would go . So , I looked for another shortcut that would lead me to the commune . I crossed through that place called Kajevuba and as I had made two steps , I found the Interahamwe who were forcing a lady to open the door of the toilets in which she was hiding . " Open the door you bitch @"@ , the Interahamwe were shouting at her . And she was pleading for forgiveness inside the toilet saying , "@ Please forgive me . @" Because I had already bumped into them , I could neither run back nor continue a head . But my heart told me , " Be strong and go ahead . @" Therefore , I went ahead and joined the Interahamwe . I still had the spatula . In fact , I was the first person to bang my spatula on the toilet 's door so that they would n't know me . I said , " Bitch , you have to open the door . @" While we were banging the door , I realized that in case they got her and killed her , they would realize that I am a stranger and they would know that I am a Tutsi then I would be killed next . Then I said loudly , "@ Men , I need to pee . @" So I pretended as if I was going to pee behind the house and I took off . From then I never thought of going to the commune again . I went down to my home village that was known as Karambi .

That was when the killings started and many people were fleeing from Kibuye . I remember some people used to go for patrols and some of them used to ask my elder bothers to join them in the tour of duty . Therefore , they would join them and make rounds . Later on , the people who used to call my brothers for patrols were mislead by the counsellors and the bergomaster who was called Nsabimana Basile and they stopped making patrols and started burning people 's homes instead .

They came and took dad to a certain center that was around . They made him sit there and beat him . I heard that they did not kill him on that day . We spent about two days in the millet plantation . Then they came back at home , but dad was still alive ; they had n't killed him yet . A day later ... we did n't know where dad was . In the millet plantation where we were , behind home ... we were with mum and the rest of my brothers and sisters . We were five children . The boys left us . I remained there with mum and my older sister . In the evening we went to a certain hill in our village and hid in a cave . And the following evening we left and mum took us to our nieghbours . When we reached there mum asked them to hide me as I was the last born . They told my mum that they were not allowed to keep Inyenzi . We immediately went back to hid in a millet plantation . After about two days ... mum suggested that we go to a church and hide there .

The Inkotanyis fought a lot and reached Kigali city and were not far from Rugunga . The war went on , there were gun shots all over the place and we fled the place as soon as we got a way out . At that time , there was no longer anyone asking for people 's identity cards and you could not tell who was a Hutu and who was a Tutsi , everyone was fleeing . We fled but the young girl I spoke about earlier was n't able to flee as her health state was critical . Later on , the Inkotanyis took us to Saint @-@ André [ a school in Kigali ] where they continued to protect us . Bibi remained behind with the casualties , among them was that girl . After the war , they told us all to go back home . When I got back , the girl was no longer there ... she passed away . Even Minani , they suffered so much . I think about them all whenever I remember the things that happened during the war , the hardships people went through ... the ones I myself experienced . I remember that girl and Mélanie more than my own siblings who passed away . I felt so bad especially because the girl and I never got to really talk .

Therefore , they must n't live . @" Then the former burgomaster of Mabana district ; Mr. Bagirishema Ignace came . He was moving in a car speaking loudly using a microphone , he was saying that , "@ all Tutsis wherever they are should come up at the district 's offices in oder for them to ensure all the Tutsi 's security at once . @" Because they had started burning from all sides except our home village . However they would begin from the valley and come up to the hill slowly by slowly . They had burned all those ends of Mushubati , Gihara sector , and they were proceeding towards Rubengera . Therefore , after realising that houses were being burnt , yet someone was anouncing that all Tutsis should seek refugee at the district 's offices where they would offer security services to all of them . We all went to the district ; my father , my mother and families all of us we left for the district . When we reached there , there were many people , it was on the 7th of April . Morning come , which was on the 8th of April 1994 but people continued coming in big numbers . Then Bagirishema the burgomaster went on and said , "@ since several people are still coming , yet the Bakiga are coming from up there with a plan of killing you from here . I guess the best idea is to carry your properties and babies , and help those who can not walk , up to the stadium . Since it is a big place and well fenced , it will be easy to protect you as required . @" Truly at the district it was not secure because it was an open place with people coming in big numbers , others were on the road ; some would come with all their belongings ... So he said that we had to go to the stadium where we would all be protected . Geneerally it was the safer place where no one would attack us and be able to do any harm to us .

They took my dad and mum and my young brother who was called Serubibi Guido and my sister Mukakimenyi Marcelline . They took them saying that they were taking them to the District 's offices . Somewhere on the way , they put my mum aside . One of the militias made my young brother escape through the millet plantation that was around because he was aware of what was going to be done to those people . Later his companions looked for my brother , a certain man who was nicknamed Nangwahafi Samuel , his real name was Ntezimana Samuel , looked for my brother asking , "@ Where did Guido go ? Where is he ? @" But they never found him .

I was in Nairobi , Kenya then , all by myself . During the day I used to walk around and spend time with others who were in the same situation . But almost every night , I would remember everything and I would feel like I did not know where I was . In reality , apart from my close family , I lost many other relatives . My big brother who was also my neighbour , his wife and my father , some children who were living with them , you know the way the African family is , were also all killed .

It 's only in 1993 that I understood they were political parties and why they were created . When I would hear of Inkotanyi , I thought of them in a negative way because I believed what was said about them . I was not aware of what was coming next . In 1993 my grandfather told me they might have resumed their mission , the one they had in 1959 and 1973 . @" I would think that ... he did n't think people would kill others .

I knew I would one day go back there because I believed there had to be some survivors . I looked for a job in a European project , there were many of that kind at that time . I got a job and started working . Then I went home and there was no one , not even a single person and all the houses had been destroyed . The people I met told me how they were killed , that 's all told me . I came back to Kigali and went back to work . Then I was told that my aunts were still alive . I went to see them and found them , they married Hutu men . They told me that they had n't been able to help anyone survive , be it in my immediate family , be it in my dad 's bigger family but they said there could be some of my cousins and my little brother who survived although they did n't know exactly where they were . They told me Shumbusho was beaten and they left him thinking he was dead . They said someone told them he was in the Turquoise zone , among the children that were picked here and there . I asked the auntie who was saying it if she did n't know where he was and she said she did n't have a clue where he could be . I told my auntie called Chantal that I was going to leave my job and go to look for my uncle Mutabazi 's children as well as Shumbusho . I came back to Kigali and resigned , but my employers were very kind to me , they said they were n't going to let me resign but they were giving me some time off so I could look around for any potential survivor within my family . I first went to all orphanages looking for either Shumbusho , either Violette and Claudette , my uncle 's children .

It would rain but I would enter in the trench and whenever it would shine I would sit in the sorghum plantation . Dogs would come and I would faint because of fear and I would come back to my senses when they had left . I wonder why they never bit me . The war stopped before someone 's finger or any dog 's teeth neither touched me . I was alone .

There were about 5,000 people at ETO . The ones you see are those who were hiding in the hills of Gahanga . Some were killed and others came back .

I am not supposed to be asked about the salt at home , soap or anything else . So , when I see all that ... any way I have a way I bare with it . Sometimes when I have so much problems I fail to get sleep and spend the whole night awake and maybe sleep in the morning . Sometimes I have wondered if a person has two hearts because , there 's always a voice that consoles me telling me do this instead of that . If it was n't that , I would have done something wrong that would give me more problems . And I do not want to become the talk of town , people would laugh at me which I basically avoid . Therefore I keep quiet and see days passing .

That is when my mum 's cousin came home . But he did not spend the night there ; he went back on the same day . And then soldiers came home to look for him . They searched in our house but they did not find him . In April , I remember it was at night around ... between 8 p.m and 9 p.m if can remember . We heard from the radio that Habyarimana was dead . Then followed cries ; people crying and shootings ... soldiers shot so many bullets . We did n't know what was taking place . We were so frightened . In the morning on the radio they said that no one should leave his or her house . It was declared that people should n't walk in twos .

When they reached at home they told them that I had gone to school . Therefore , they decided to come to school yet I was on my way coming back home , because I was used to going home at break time . There is a way you see something and become stiff ; I was walking home but even though I was walking , I was careless of what was around me . I would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how I was going to lead it . It seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part . Therefore , we met as I was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) . I used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . Because I would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me . I would talk to no body . So I would feel like life has stopped ... so I would finally go home .

There was a lot of noise at around eight in the evening . "@ They are dead . All those who went to Nyamata , this is the time for the killings in Nyamata . @" I said to myself . I ignored everything and went towards home . It was almost eight thirty in the evening . I passed by my home compound but I did n't want to enter inside the house . I was afraid because there was no sign of life ; nothing indicating if there was anyone . I feared to enter . What if I bumped into Interahamwe in the house , I thought . I passed by the house and went on . On my way I met some boys who had survived [ they did n't go to hide at the church ] . We greeted each other and chatted a bit about how they survived and then I told them how I was afraid to enter in my home . "@ I just heard the calf crying but I never heard any human sound . @" I said . I asked them to remain with me . So , we remained together and went away .

But Céline my daughter who survived told me some of the things . Also some neighbours who escaped death by hiding and fleeing told me about it . We were living in Kicukiro . On the first day they came to ask my family , "@ Who is Murengezi ? @" They told them I was not there . They shot my wife on the feet and said , "@ We shall come back . Find him ! @" They did not come back until the 8th when my family went to hide in a convent which was in the neighbourhood . On the 10th , they came and told them that everybody should go down , as they wanted to check their identity cards . They stood next to a roadblock and took them to a hole nearby , one by one . Some were shot dead , others were killed with a hammer , and some others were hacked . In fact , someone told me that my wife was last taken as she was limping and they shot her inside the hole where the others were . The hole is still there ; we have constructed it . About a hundred people in our neighbourhood died and we buried them all together in the same grave , which we built up . There were other people in my house apart from my wife and my children . The people who were working for us were also there . There was a lady , a friend of ours who used to work for us . She had stopped working for us as we got for her another job , she happened to be at home on that day . They checked her ID and found out she was a Hutu and they told her to leave . She was helping out my wife who was wounded and she told them she was n't going to leave and they could kill her if they wanted . So they murdered her right there next to my wife . Because he was tall , Claude , according to what his sister told me , was beaten with a club on his head and they threw him inside the hole . After hitting you with a hammer or with something else , then they would shoot you in order to stop people from making noise .

Some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream . One could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper . And from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him . The cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most .

Because when you kill someone you are also suppose to be killed . But that is not what happened , because the current government used a new rule , which says that whoever reveals the truth , his punishment will be reduced . And that is what I chose to do . Therefore , the fact that I was sentenced to a seven years imprisonment yet I killed somebody , but simply because I revealed the truth and asked for forgiveness , pleases me a lot . And I must say that I am pleased . But such people who still denies and hides the truth , they should not be given the same punishment . Because they are hiding the truth and that adds weight on what they did . To me , I believe such people should be punished by the authorities accordingly , following the rules that guide them .

He had tried to make it look better so people can show a bit of respect towards the place . He had realized that there was no other way of exhuming the corpses . He got it concreted . Later on , the ministry lent us a machine and people from Kicukiro and Kanombe dug it up , but they were unable to go over 8 meters because of the gas and the cows remnant ... They were at least able to exhume the remains of 8 people that they buried in respect with other bones .

The worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people 's death could n't tell us the names of people who died there . Among them , they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas . However , the people who witnessed them the day they were killed could n't tell us who they were . We even tried to contact my neighbour ( our houses are next to each other ) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim 's remains . He stood in his home and could peep through his fencing ; he did n't want to come here . It is hard to know the people who died here . Up to now he can not tell you the truth ; he says that he saw the Interahawe so and so passing by . People 's remains are everywhere ; just in front here , there are remains , even in our gardens they are others . There is a time we wanted to dig in our garden but as one would dig in the soil , could fine a skull . In fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here .

Then I would tell them all that happened and explain to them how politics contributed to all that happened .

That is the principle that my child would ever follow . I would teach them never to believe in getting something after killing someone . That is what I believe I would tell them ... I would tell them that , whenever they see someone inciting the genocide , they should always try to stop them . If necessary , they should loose their lives over it instead of seeing massive deaths again .

Fortunately they did n't see us and at night we left the place . We went and reached a place called Mbogo where we found other soldiers of Habyarimana . They took us to Muhondo which is found in Shyorongi but it is in Zenga sector next to Ruhe towards Tare . At night they told us that we were going to Shyorongi . They took us there and we camped just in front of where my grandpa used to live . We got there ... I never thought they killed them . I just kept thinking they ought to be there . They never ... in my head I never thought they had died . Therefore , I decided to leave the camp and go there and when I reached my grandpa 's house , I found only ruins ; all houses had been demolished , one could n't tell which one was the bedroom . That day I went back and the whole day I was just thinking about the situation and I was so confused . The soldiers sent me to the station where refugees were camping , to go and buy some food . When I reached there , I met all the other Interahamwe whom we were neighbours . But no one could tell me anything because I was in the combat uniform shirt . Then I thought some of my family members would be there . I went round expecting to see them . They had asked me to hurry up , so I quickly went back and found a roadblock set up by the Interahamwes , with a man who was supervising it . However , I do n't remember his name but all I know his older brother was called Kanamugire ; and Kanamugire is still alive . That Interahamwe had a gun , then he asked me , "@ Are n't you ashamed of moving around yet we killed all your family ? You will be the last one to be killed . @" He made me sit down at the roadside . And then he hit my back with the gun 's butt . I even went to hospital due to that injury and I am still suffering from it today .

I ran beyond a place where there used to be rocks . The local counsellor had ordered people to remain in their homes . He had said , "@ Nobody should leave their homes and people should stay together . @" Therefore people gathered together on one hill , which was Kayumba hill . That place was bushy and stony and crowded with the people who had gathered there , children , women , and cattle ... Generally that is the place where we had camped . Some people would go home and prepare food in secret and bring the food to people in the camp where we were . Later on , the Interahamwe spread into the camp and killed so many people ; women were killed , old people , children ... Tutsis died on that day . I remember that is the day when my uncle 's wife was killed . The majority of the Tutsis from Kayumba died from there . The Interahamwe poured in those innocent people and killed them so badly . I continued to Nyamata centre but the counselor had warned us from going to Nyamata centre because all the plans of violence were made from there . But most people never agreed with him , because on my way I was with Tutsi refugees who were fleeing with their cows and belongings and when oasked , they could say that they were going to the commune or to the church [ Nyamata church and commune are next to each other ] . Therefore , people would say that they were going there to seek for protection . In people 's mind , the church and the commune were always secure .

A fight like that between two drunkards who start it up and maybe one of them dies . The same people say that there was no genocide . I as a Rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , I admit that there was genocide in Rwanda . I do n't deny it . Yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" And they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @" One group of Rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed . Up to this day leaders in the former government are behind it . Yet those of us they were leading in different places by then , admit it as a truth that Genocide happened here . We have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was Genocide . Those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country . There is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her . We admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light . As a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful . Instead they should unit together with the Rwandans who are ready to say the truth . And together tell people what happened and how it happened . They should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime . This means that , there was Genocide . Then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there . Preach them how it took place repeatedly . But not keeping quiet about it . Until when everyone will learn that Genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country .

However no one wanted to kill me , I had been in the same school with most of the perpetrators . Therefore , whoever they would tell to kill me would go back because I would look straight in his eyes . Then another group of Interahamwe came , Shyaka and Alex [ I do n't know his other name ] were among them . All I know about Alex is that he was a son to Muneza Yohana [ John ] . Then Alex asked , "@ Look at that cretin as tall as Rwigemera ! I will show you what I will do with him . @" It was late in the evening and it was dark ; one could n't see clearly . Then he got a hammer wanting to hit me on the head , somehow I moved the head and he hit on the neck . He hit me three times and I do n't know how I got into the pit . I do n't know if it is someone who pushed me there , or if I went in by myself . I only remember the moment when I gained conscious and found myself lying on my stomach in faeces @/ excrements . It was a latrine that had already been used . But the piece of cloth , which they had used to tie me , had loosened and my arms were like this ... I noticed that they had thrown bricks on me . Fortunately , the bricks fell on the side ; they did not hit me . I do n't know what they did to my sister @-@ in @-@ law , whom we were together , up there . But I guess they raped her and then she was dumped into the pit upside down while she was still tied up . All her bones at this level [ he shows ] were broken ; her pelvic bones were crashed .

Well some of these people say that they want to join the survivors association . Some join and sometimes get traumatised after hearing people 's testimonies within the association . That is a simple example . But I personally if I get my own children , I will tell my children the stories of genocide and show them the consequences of it . I will show them my scar of the 1994 Genocide . I know it will be hard . But my children will have to keep it at heart . But I am worried because there are some people , the Hutu for example who will keep on harassing my kids . But I really wonder if they will one day feel free to live with us with no worries ?

My mother was a primary school teacher . Whenever she 'd get her pay , she used to tell me to find her in a place called Rubengera at around 1 p.m. after her meeting and she 's buy me milk and cake as I was still a child . When I reached secondary school , she once told me that she wanted to buy me a bottle of primus ( beer ) , but she forbade me to finish it . She then told me she wanted me to know that there are many stages in life and that I had now moved on to a level where she no longer considered me as a child @: she could now confide in me . She told me many things on that day .

We ceiled it with soil and I had many .... trees and the charismas trees there I brought them used them to prepare it and then we covered it since the hole was towards that banana tree . Those who came in for searching could n't see a thing . The people were in the holes outside . At times when it used to rain I would get them out and put them into my house even the other residences could see them but it would be raining and when the rain is almost over , I would hurry up and get them back into the holes so that no one ever saw them . A time came when the war ended and the Inkotanyi arrived they got them out and we went to the part which they had conquered . I came back in July after the war .

[ he cries ] Something that hurts me whenever I recall it ... in fact that 's the reason I had was unable to talk . On the 13th of April 1994 , the day they came to kill my family members . Mum found me where I was hiding ; she brought me ... I was very hungry and she knew I was because , by then nobody could cook . And , there was nothing left in the house ; the stock was empty . They would bribe the hungry Interahamwe with food , so that they do n't kill them for sometime . Only beans were left at home . But , because she knew I did not like beans , she brought me some vegetables and passion fruits . Then she said to me ; "@ I failed to find anything for you to eat but ... @" [ he again cries ] . She said , "@ I could n't find anything to bring you . The people I told you about , the ones who do n't like us took everything from me . Now I am failing to get something to give my child . @" Then she added , "@ Try and eat this , it will be okay . And , be strong . @" Today , passion fruits constitute a reminder of the last meal my mum gave me . The other thing I remember is that , before she died , she told me that my sister and I should be very strong if we happen to survive , she told me to be a man ! Those are the two things that are still on my heart till this day .

There came a time the blood started to flow out of the head . I was bleeding so much ; the blood was flowing out of the nose and ears . I lived with that illness for a period of nine months . In 1997 , I was hospitalized again and I got well . I started to live on ; I went to school to study . I lived in the orphanage , there were people who used to come and visit us . They brought to us different things among which clothes and other things , there were from an NGO called CICR . There came a man and said @: ‘ I would like to take the other kid who is always lonely , I want her to stay with my children ’ . It was me that he was talking about because I used to like staying in a quiet place due to the headache I suffered . It was safe for me when I am out of noise . Whenever he came , he could see me lonely . So they allowed him to go with me if he feels that he is able . He was told @: 'if you want a child in here , first come and introduce yourself and say how you will care about her and once the orphanage is satisfied , can let you go with the child ’ .

Gusa hagati aho muri Jenoside bwo narasufuye [ naratesetse ] cyane , kuko nagiye mpura n' ibibazo kandi ... ||| Generally , during the genocide , I suffered a lot because I got many problems yet ...
Icyo gihe twari twavuze tuti nibaramuka bari mubantu baje turaca hehe ? ||| That time we had said that in case they come where shall we pass ?
Nyuma ya Jenoside , byasaga nk' aho nanone usigaye mu muriro . Kuko ibintu byose byari hirya yari imirambo , yari intumbi nta muntu muzima wari usigaranye . Wacaga iruhande rwawe ukabona umuntu...aho yaguye , ukabona undi yari amagufa ... Ndibuka njyewe ngenda mbona umwana yonka ... yonka nyina yarapfuye . Ariko namurebye sinigeze ngira ikintu nkora , kuko numvaga nanjye ubwanjye ntakaye . Sinigeze mfata uwo mwana ngo mwigizeyo , ahubwo naramurebye gusa ndigendera . Mu mutwe numvaga ndi ... numvaga nta kintu kirimo . No mu bwenge numvaga nta kintu kirimo , ntago nakoze ibintu by' abazima . Gusigara rero nyuma y' icyo gihe wumvaga ari nk' uko umuntu yatwika ishyamba ryoseee ... hanyuma akakureka ukagenda mu bushye . Kuko byari nko kugenda uri igicucu , cyangwa uri nk' ikintu kitazi n' ikintu na kimwe . ||| After the genocide , it still felt like hell . There were dead bodies all over the place , everywhere you passed , you 'd see corpses . I remember seeing a baby that was breastfeeding on its mother 's dead body and I did nothing to stop the child , as I myself felt so confused . I did n't know what was going on . Surviving that time felt like walking through some bush after it has been burnt . I felt stupid , as though I did n't know anything .
Twihishanye...muri ubwo bwihisho bwanjye , nabanaga n' abandi bagabo , bari bameze nkanjye gutyo . ||| I was hiding with other men who were in the same situation as me .

I heard the other boy screaming , begging for forgiveness . They beat him saying , "@ Where were you going you Inkotanyi . @" They repeatedly beat him I believe he died there . I did n't know that I had been hacked . The wounds were still fresh so I could n't tell . Therefore , I sat there and when the other perpetrator [ the one who hacked me ] saw his companions , he shouted and called them . Just below where I was , I heard people shouting back , "@ Calm down , calm down . @" Then I whispered to myself ; "@ I am dead . @" But God made me strong and I remained seated . "@ Calm down , calm down . @" Several voices from all corners calming him . The number of people had increased considerably as they came to see what was happening . I was praying thinking I was dead . All those people met at the main road and then he told them that there was one Inkotanyi in the bush . He suggested that they enter the bush but some people who had just woken up said it was okay , that tomorrow was another day . They were trying to discourage them from entering the bush .
Ariko hariya nkuko nabibwiye urukiko hari compagnie .... Ya nyarugenge iyo mitwe inyuranye yari MRND , SDR za etat majoro . ||| But the other area was controlled by Nyarugenge territory company as I have already told the court . The groups were MRND , CDR under the staff command

I have already explained that the government accepted the publication and teaching of the ten commandments of hutus to the population .

Political parties such as MRND , CDR , MDR Power , PL Power and governmental administration kept conspiring in the capital Kigali . As far as the killings of Tutsis from October 1st 1990 to December 31st 1994 are concerned , the reaction was that all reports showed that those killings were carried out by the government of Rwanda together with FAR , authorities at all levels as well as a big number of the population .
Nibwo naje kujya hariya muri tromatisme [ ikigo kivura ihahamuka ] , aba ariho nkorera nabo , nabanje no gukorana n' umugore witwa Esther umwe wakoreraga muri Avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba Jenoside ] nyuma y' amezi atandatu nibwo nongeye kongera kuvuga .

I even started to work with Esther who was with AVEGA . I was able to talk again six months later and I went back to school . But I shifted from Byimana to APACE . The situation continued like that up to when they [ Trauma Centre ] advised me to be in the habit of talking to my friends and telling them my story , vice @-@ versa . I usually do n't talk , not even to the members of my family ; but this is because they have never seen a war . There is none I can say that he or she knows a war . None of them has ever seen a person being killed . Even the few who have seen dead bodies just saw them on TV . That is the reason why I believe there is nobody I can talk to about such stories because I believe they do n't know a thing . That is the only reason .
Ubwo ku itariki enye bari baraye barasa baravuga ngo nitwebwe twaraye turasa mu mugi wa Kigali . ||| On the 4th of October 1990 they had spent the night shooting in the air and they said that we were the ones that were shooting Kigali .

You could n't expect good result when you tell the Hutu to stand up and after Tutsi to do the same , for what purpose ? We were asking ourselves what was all that for ? And our parents used to tell us that they were survivors of Hutu persecutions in the previous years . They always used to complain about it .
Ariko n' inkuru ndende kugera i Burundi ni birebire , Noneho mu kugaruka hano nageze aha ku itariki 16/07/1994 mvuye i Burundi , Kigali imaze iminsi ifashwe nibwo twahise tugera aha , nza nihuta n' imfunguzo nyine mvuga nti byibuze ngiye kureba n' imyenda ntahe n' imyenda n' iki , nibwo nasanze hano hashenye n' iriya nzu yacu yo haruguru ishenye . ||| However it is a long story about the experience in Burundi . Therefore , we came back and reached here on the 16th July , 1994 . When I left Burundi , it was a few days after the Inkotanyi had captured Kigali . Therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind . But I found when this part was demolished . Even the other house of ours was demolished .

The perpetrators came saying @: "@ We are tired , we shall take these fat kids [ Freddy and his sister ] later . @" Therefore , my sister and I stayed behind and they took the younger ones . With our own eyes , we saw them being taken and they were killed not far from where we were . However , I was not able to see each and everything . But while killing them ... they would scream and we heard them screaming . Another thing I remember is that my mum was taken very far away to be killed . Therefore , we went running ... at night she [ her deadbody ] was still out there . A certain boy and I rushed there and buried her . We simply covered her with soil . In brief I only saw my mum 's corpse . I never saw the corpses of the rest . I only heard the noise my sisters made while they were being killed .

The genocide started when I was away from home , I was in Kigali . I had been fleeing the war for sometime then as people knew I had wanted to send my brother in the Inkotanyis ' army and it was very bad being called an Inkotanyi then . I came to live with a lady called Maria who was a family friend . The war started while I was living at her house . When the war broke up , it was like a nightmare ... It was like a nightmare because even though they used to talk about it , I never thought it could actually happen ... I did n't know people could change and become wolves . Maria told me that the President had died the previous night and that the war had started . She told me that I needed to pack my things in the morning and leave her home . I asked why , what had happened ... "@ Do n't you know that the President died and was killed by the Tutsis ? So you need to get out of my house ! @"

Personally I do not know the family of the person I killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families I decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general . But we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like RWIHEZA INNOCENT . He was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector . We would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise . But the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ Gacaca level . @" In Gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ I am sure we know family per family ] . Then we will count . It would be more or less like a census . Then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies . Well I can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried . Hence they exhume and rebury them officially . In that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything .

What is good about this book is that he did research in every prefecture in the country and he found they were similar to names of clans , the word tribe in French is clans , 19 clans . In those clans therefore there is what we called tribes which is false , there are The Hutu , Tutsi and Twa in every tribe .

Before we went separate ways , Dominque said to me @: "@ Do you know what , let 's go back and we will leave the place tomorrow if the Inkotanyi do not come to rescue us , I have hope they will come to rescue . That is what happened , we went in separate places in order to sleep as we knew none of the interahamwe would attack in the night , they always attacked day time but we continued to hear gunfire increasing , within the gunfire I heard people coming and they said @: "@ Masengo it 's us inkoyanyi . @" They were calling Masengo , Tunga and Kariyopi , the reason those inkotanyi knew our names is because they are some people whom we were together in Saint Paul and were got rescued by the UN peace keepers [ MINUAR ] , so those people told those Inkotanyi about us . Among those people was one called Ndengeyingoma and another one called Musafiri , so those inkotanyi came to rescue us .

These things did not happen , like me saying that it is a bad thing or the church . But you see that I have not said the catholic church only , I 'm saying the church as a whole , those who speak for the church should have , at a certain point said no.

Ntabwo nakubwira ngo numvise mbabariye cyangwa ... kuko iyo uhuye nabo uta ubwenge . Nta kindi utekereza . ||| I do not know the people who killed my family because I was not there . I probably meet them without knowing they are the ones . But the man who was in the group pf the people who killed my mother is there . When you meet them you just buy them a drink or something . There was a time I met a killer at the taxi park in town and instead of him being the one to have a problem , it is me who had one . I felt so shocked , my heart stopped beating . I sat down , as I felt dizzy . I can not tell you that I thought of forgiving them or even of taking revenge . I was terrified . I had goose pimples . I can not tell you that I forgave them or anything else , when you meet them you almost loose your mind , you can not think straight !
Hari icyo wabikozeho ngo @: uvuge ngo urasaba imbabazi , cyangwa ngo urabegera ngo ubabanire ? ||| Did you do anything about it ? For example like apologizing to them ... ?

Therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ? Could you explain about it ?
Sinzi njyewe ubanza ari umugisha w' Imana gusa . Kuko abo Bantu batugiriye neza , ni abantu mu byukuri tutakundaga kugenderana , nk' uwo mugabo nakubwiraga nti @: wenda yari yarabyaye mushiki wanjye muri batisimu , umugore w'...uwo mugabo Pascal . Ariko mu by' ukuri ntabwo ari umuntu twasabanaga bihambaye , ku buryo ibintu yakoze , n' abo bandi bose twagiye duhungiraho biratangaje . Abakwiye kubikora ni abongabo twari duturanye ko mu by' ukuri wabonaga aribo dufitanye...abo twakwiranye kugirana ubumwe bari hafi . Ariko abongabo ukuntu baje guhinduka vraiment , ngira ngo nabigereranya n' uko ari wa mutima w' umuntu w' ubwicanyi , basanzwe bafite mu by' ukuri bagashaka kubyorosaho , ariko mu by' ukuri bafite wa mutima . Cyane ari ibintu byigishijwe imyaka n' imyaka , arabifite ariko akabura imbaraga zo kubikora . Iyo ariko une fois abonye ikimutera inkunga agahita ahaguruka . Ariko na babandi rero utakekaga , ko bashobora ku kugirira akamaro kurenza babandi , ukabona nibo bakakugiriye ngirango simbizi bishobora kuba biterwa na kamere y' umuntu cyangwa se za mbaraga z' Imana , sinzi icyatumye bahinduka gutyo . ||| I can not tell . Maybe it was by God 's mercy . They really helped us yet we were n't friends . For example , that man I was talking about , Pascal ... he was my sister 's godfather . However , we were not so close to his family . We never expected him to help us the way he did . Surprisingly those who were supposed to help us , I mean our neighbours , those who seemed to be our relatives . They surely changed ! I would say they had always had a cruel nature , they were killers at heart and they had been pretending throughout . Maybe they had been sensitized to kill for ages but they had n't got courage to put it into practice . Once such a person gets someone to motivate him to killing , he hurries up into the action . The strangest thing is that the people we never expected to help us are the ones who did and those we thought would be the first ones to kill us were the ones to save us . I think it just depends on someone 's nature or personality . If not so , then it is by God 's power . I can not tell why they behaved like that .

Renzaho entered . For Munyakazi , Sainte @-@ Famille was like his home because he usually came there . They usually came there with goats and asked to have their meal in priests ' buildings . The only priest who stayed there was called Wensislas Munyeshyaka . He [ Munyakazi ] was at Sainte @-@ Famille every time and every single hour . They were checking whether the number of young men was enough so that they might carry them out .

Meanwhile when Inkotanyi came and took people with them , MP Rugema Donatien went among the people . On the way he came back to Saint @-@ Paul lest he should get killed . He had joined the group at Saint @-@ Paul and stayed with them . When I went there for their help , he immediately ran away and went to Sainte @-@ Famille to tell displaced people who were in that he had just escaped from death @: lieutenant @-@ colonel had taken people in a pickup and was going to kill them .

Ariko nabonye apfa ariko sinigeze ngira ingufu zo kumwegera ngo ndebe aho yari ari . Kuko hari hakiri abantu baseka bishimye bavuga bati @: "@ twavumbuye umuntu . @" ||| I saw many people being killed . I remember in particular this man who was found by the Interahamwes from his hiding place . Some had clubs , others machetes , they run after him for about five minutes before they caught him . Someone beat him on his head with a club as I was watching . He did not do anything ; he just fell down and died right away . The other thing I saw is this girl who was also killed very badly . They found the place where she was hiding also and run after her . She was left there agonizing for about thirty minutes and I was hearing everything . I saw her dying but I did not have the strength to approach her , as they were still standing next to her , laughing , happy to have found a prey .
Abo bantu iyo ntabi...abo bantu...niyo mpamvu nanjye numvise ibyo bintu ari bibi nkabyirega , abo bantu nabishe nta kintu na kimwe bankoshereje , nta na kimwe , ku buryo nanjye byanteye agahinda yuko nishe bagenzi banjye , mbahoye ubusa . ||| That is why I realized that what I did was very bad and reported myself . I killed innocent people who had n't done any thing wrong to me . That is why whenever I think about it , I become very miserable because I killed my fellow people yet they had n't done anything to me .
Bon nuko noneho bageze aho baravuga bati noneho mukurikize , munyeshyaka abivugana nuyu mugabo ati n' ukureba abantu barebare mukajya mubatandukanya ||| Okay ! Then Father Munyeshyaka with this man said @: "@ follow this order ; separate tall people from others @"@ .

Uko hameze ubu , njye uko mbibona mbona bitanshimishije kuko numva babajyana nko mu nzibutso kuko n' ubundi aha ni mu rugo rw' umuntu , nta n' igihamya kerekana ko ari n' abantu bahaguye mu ntambara . Numva ikiza ari uko bajya nko mu nzibutso umuntu akajya abasangayo . ||| I do not appreciate the way it is now , I do not like it . I think they should be taken to a memorial site since this is somebody 's house anyway . There 's nothing that shows that these people were killed during the war . I believe it would be better to take them to a memorial site and people would visit them there .
Ndagenda ngarukira ibukavu kuko twajyanye nuriya mukecuru zaninka iwabo i butare . ||| I went up to Bukavu because we went along with the old lady Zaninka to her home in Butare

They stopped us from a distance and asked us , " Where are you from ? @" We also asked them in return , "@ And you where are you from ? @" I remember it was moonlight they came a little bit closer and checked on us ; my friend had a very long nose , so they said , " Check this one . These are Inkotanyi . @" They ordered us to sit down but I immediately pinched him . Deep in my heart , I had a feeling that I should run rather than sit there and die such a death . Then they started raising their machetes . I looked behind and swiftly run . One Interahamwe chased me , you can imagine a grown up man chasing a young boy , and of course he was faster than me . We ran the whole road when I saw that he was about to catch me , I entered into the millet plantation that was nearby .

I will n't get into your car . @" The burgomaster insisted , "@ you will enter it unwillingly . @" But dad refused ; "@ I can not get into that car . @" Then he started working towards home and then the burgomaster said to him that , "@ though we did n't find it ... though I am telling you that it is here yet it is not the one but you should be aware that you will never stay here . You have to join others . @" dad ignored him and continued to go . I recalled all that after I saw that policeman who was with the burgomaster when they were checking at home . In a moments time after the car had passed , I would see how they were catch people and killing them . On one would get a person and kill him ; let 's say hit him or at once with a club . They would cut off a foot first , then hit him or her with a club , and leave him or her still alive . They had clubs of this shape ... they used to call them ‘ Ntampongano y'umwanzi . ’ They were spiked clubs , with nails and if they hit it on the leg , there would remain holes on the leg . And , if they hit it in the head , it means that , the bone would be crashed and one would keep bleeding . But one would n't die , depending on which part they hit . Therefore , whenever I would see how they kill people , I would just tell that I would die a painful death and I would immediately move . I immediately stood up and started walking around in the sorghum plantation . That time I was not meeting people anymore instead I would meet dogs . Whenever they would see plants shaking they would send dogs . So I would faint and wake up the following day in the morning . And , I would neither tell where I was nor what had happened . That is how days would go by but if there were no sorghum plants , I wonder what would have happened . I guess none would have survived . From then , people stopped coming instead they would send dogs . Then I got so hungry but I did n't know what to do . There were no other crops rather than sorghum . Therefore , you would imagine eating grass , which was impossible . After all , thoughts about food would come to your mind only when you were resting , which was for a small time . Most of the time one would n't feel hunger or ... we could n't drink , that was out .

I would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? Have you ever asked them to forgive you ?

Unless I get ... a leader from a particular country that denies that there was genocide in Rwanda . Then I would convince him or her that genocide did take place in Rwanda . And if necessary , I would take him or her to those places where they exhumed and reburried those innocent people who died . I would make sure he or she gets to see those remains of people and show him or her all those who were handicaped due to the genocide until when he or she...understands that genocide actually took place in Rwanda . Because most countries can not imagine how someone can hold a machete and hack his or her equal .

One evening , Micheveux told me , "@ Ode , I am going to die . @" I asked her why she was saying that and who she thought could find us there and kill us . "@ I am smelling blood , I feel like I am smelling blood , I am going to die . @" I told her to calm down and that she was going to be okay . That evening , Micheveux went back to her home , the Interahamwes came and took them all . They were many children in that family , about 8 of them . Only one child survived . I continued hiding in the same house but at some point there started feeling like the war was never going to end and I represented a risk to their own lives as anyone who was found hiding a Tutsi person then would be tortured if not killed . Thérèse finally told me she could no longer hide me as people in the neighbourhood knew I was still alive . Therefore , they were looking for me .

When you escape death , when maybe someone was about to cut you down and does not do it and you 're still alive the next day , that is when you appreciate life . You then realize that your life or other people 's lives are of great value . You understand that everyone gets affected by things just like you do . I now think twice before I do something bad to others because I know it hurts others as much as it could hurt me . It taught me respect for both my life and for other people 's lives .

That old man also had a very big family . If one said that there were only two families in that area , one would be almost true . Almost everyone was related to that old man called Nshaka and the rest were related to my grandfather . That was the only type of people you would find there .

I watched him for a while , wondering what would happen to him . By chance , a merciful woman who lived in that area came and put him on her back and carried him away .

So after the war , being able to find out that some people were still alive was very encouraging and motivated us to want to continue to live and give your best . Especially because somebody needed to look after the children who survived so that they could study and live a good life and achieve something .

In 1994 the situation got worse . I remember my dad had retired several years before and we were living in Nyamata , which used to be called Kayumba sector . In Nyamata I saw the real change that had occurred ; that is when I opened my eyes . Because from the year 1990 to 1992 , it seemed as though we were blind ; those days , we could flee and just go to the Commune or to churches and the priests could protect us and then we could go back to our homes . Therefore , we never thought it was a big problem . But in 1994 , I finally accepted that the facts the way they were . That is when the councillor who was also a Tutsi held a meeting and said , "@ I am no longer invited in meetings that are held on behalf of the government . Therefore , I do n't attend government meeting . But be ready we are in danger ; stop that habit of fleeing towards the commune or to Nyamata church . This time the killings will start from those areas . All I can advise you , is to be ready and face what is going to happen here . @" Because he was a leader , he had spied and got that information . "@ All the plans for killing that are going to take place are made in the Nyamata commune , in churches ; they all have the same plans @"@ , he added . He warned us that no one should make a mistake of going to the former hiding places . I learned a lot in that meeting . Normally when a leader says something of that sort , it means that he is sure of it . Then I grew up in my way of thinking and was so scared . That is when I really saw how much I was vulnerable .
Sinakubwira .. batangira kujya baza guhiga muri iyo secteur ; twaririnze tukamanuka tukajya mu kibaya icyo kibaya cya Karambi tugahuriramo aho ; nabo bakamanuka bavuza amakondera aho ku Murama ; 'sinzi niba ... ubyimagine ubyishyire mu mutwe urebe ukuntu nawe nk' imisozi iba imaze hirya no hino.'

Ubwo umunsi wa mbere uba urashize . ||| I have no words to explain this ... they [ perpetrators ] started hunting people in our sector ; we had protected our sector . We could go to Karambi swamp where we could meet the attackers . Those attackers could come while producing musical sound by the use of some local musical instruments made out of horns called Amakondera and get in Murama . I wonder if you can imagine ... just put yourself in my shoe at that time and try to think about being attacked by people from all the neighbouring hills , all together for one hill . Playing those Makondera and dressed in banana leaves . That is how they became Interahamwe [ people united with a common purpose ] and surely , they looked wild . So , they came playing the Makondera and whistles with so much courage . We could just be standing in the swamp , cursing or calling one another saying , "@ Try and come here . @" They [ attackers ] came and stood on that hill at the other side and we were standing on our hill on this side . Then they started stoning us , shooting arrows , and we also did the same in turn . They used to come in a smaller number than ours , because for us the whole sector could gather yet for them , some would come while others would not . Therefore , we could put together our stones and stone them at a go . Slowly by slowly they were defeated and went back running . A day would end like that .

They took us there so that Byemayire would kill us . Fortunately , Byemayire was n't around . They procceeded and took us to a nearby center , hoping to find there some other cruel Interahamwe so that they would kill us . When we reached there , two men were hesitant , "@ We can not kill these two kids ; their father was a very good man and he helped us out several times . Let them go and be killed elsewhere . @" Therefore , we left . But the boy called Minani and his sister Yansoneye followed us saying that they were going to show us to Interahamwe in order for them to kill us . When we reached a place called Musenyi , I failed to walk because I was very tired . Minani then hacked me on the leg and said that I sould hurry .

That is what I was aware of . Habyarimana died later on died . I remember we had a councillor called Iyakaremye Emmanuel . He came at home and asked my dad in which politial party he was . My dad replied that his political party was in his heart and that it was n't necesary to tell it to him . A week later , some people from different neighbouring sectors came to our home sector . They had come to kill the Tutsis , and when they reached home , they took my dad away . They asked him to give them money . He had 30,000 FRW . Therefore , he gave it to them and came back home . Two days later , it was on a Sunday and we had gone to church . When we came back , they came home and called my dad . All of us were in the compound and they told dad that they were going to kill all of us . They took all the cows that were at home and ate them but they never killed us as they had said . After about a week , the war broke up into the whole district .

My father was called Karinamaryo Peter and my mother was called Mukagasisi Veronica . We were seven in my family but I am the only one who survived . To start with , I know we migrated to Bugesera but that was not our origin . Our origin was Ruhengeri . We migrated in 1959 escaping the Hutu persecutions . When we were young kids , we used to hear our father saying that there used to be a very big forest where they used to live . So he would tell us how it was not very easy for them while they were fleeing . They were lucky they managed to reach Bugesera . He used to tell us ... he was once the chief 's personnel assistant , [ this is what I used to hear him saying when we were young kids ] . So , on their way while coming they asked him , " Hey you ! What 's your name ? @" He replied them , "@ My name is Karinamaryo @" because that was his name . So Habyarimana 's soldiers asked him again , "@ Karinamaryo ? @" meaning ‘ the shrewd one ’ . They went on and said , "@ Can you imagine ? Listen to this guy . So go ahead and show us your shrewdness @"@ .

Well forgiving is possible . Yes it is possible . For example , personally I have forgiven . Although no one has ever come to ask me for forgiveness , I forgave all the killers . When I think about it , it goes beyond what I can comprehend . I always wonder if they really know why they killed people and wonder what they think . Then I feel sorry for their hearts , they know how they killed their own people . And sincerely , I believe they will die of a terrible death . Because they will die with a guilty conscience , deep in their hearts they must be wondering why they killed people , their relatives , their schoolmates , their colleagues , people they were brought up together , playing football together , people they played different games together . Kids who grew up together . Personally , I believe forgiving is very possible . Not holding any grudges against them is an extraordinary gift that God gave me . I just get confused about how to handle matters . I ask myself , "@ What caused this ? @" and I fail to understand the person who planned this ... But it is possible to forgive . That 's my personal conviction .

When we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that God played his role . Because human beings would never manage it without God 's power .

Even though we remember them anyway , that day is a day you share with other Rwandans in doing so and it helps us to think together and look for a way for this never to happen again in Rwanda . And that it should not happen to anybody else worldwide because it is terrible ! I also enjoy looking at their photos . My sister who was living in Kinshasa , Congo DRC had many of their photos . She is the one who gave me even the photos I showed you since the house and everything in it was burnt up . So I sometimes sit down and look at them and I remember ! I think about them and wonder how the children would be today , how their mother would be ... It is something I remember very much . Nobody can stop you from remembering your people who were so much part of your life . Even though some people do not want us to remember or to talk about it , we can not forget them . We will always remember and even our children need to be told about it . Perhaps our biggest mistake was that we never believed it could actually happen . But now we know it is possible , we are aware that people can betray others and wipe up entire families . It is something we need to fight against in our thinking and this can be done through teaching and also in fighting against it with all our strength .

His mother [ François ' ] was called Nyinakazi w'Inyezi [ meaning ‘ Mother of Inyenzi ’ ] in Gikondo . The genocide found them in Gikondo . Their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work . Whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to Inyenzi . And whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from Inyenzi . They would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . One could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family .

But I was freezing and the more the wind blew on my neck , the more the injury caused by the hammer would swell . My neck was swollen , almost to the size of my head . Then I started walking like this ... I wondered where to go ... I remembered a village called Buha where my friends whom we went to school together and with whom we used to play drum together during the holidays lived . They were called Karangwa and Rurangwa their father 's name was Ndongozi . But those boys had become terrible Interahamwes . But I still decided to go there because I thought that even if they went ahead and killed me , they would n't subject me to grave tortures before killing me . But in order to go to their home , I had to cross a river called Ruhondo . And when I reached the water , I first rolled into it so as to get rid of all the excrements and maggots . After a while I said to myself ... around that place there was a camp of Habyarinama 's soldiers in a place called Gafunzo . As I approached that area , I heard people shouting and smoking drugs . "@ These must be soldiers and they are going to kill me @"@ , I thought . Then I went back to our abandoned home where I found our dogs . When the dogs saw me , they tried to follow me but I chased them away and I passed though a nearby bush . Around there , lived a man called Pascal Kamonyo , whose wife was my godmother . And my sister called Mukaburabyo Pélagie had hid in their home .

Just the fact that one recognizes the wrong they 've done makes their sentence less severe . But personally , I do not agree with that way of doing it . This should be the case only if the killer feels guilty of what they did because otherwise , it would be a way of reducing their punishment while they do not have any conscience . I am saying this because you can meet somebody ... I always meet many people ... when you meet somebody whom you saw killing , they take a different route or they turn back and flee . If it were somebody who has truly acknowledged their wrong ... or maybe they only did it in order to have their punishment reduced because if they had truly confessed , they should even be able to recount everything in details especially because they know very well there 's nothing we can do against them . Because if that was your intention , if you wanted them imprisoned , you 'd know where to find them anyway . That 's why I do not agree with the whole process . Personally , I would n't release a prisoner just because they 've acknowledged their wrong deeds . Maybe it was fine at first ; it looked like a way of reducing problems , at least that 's the impression it got . That 's what I think . You will hear people saying that anyone would agree to plead guilty just to have their punishment reduced and that does n't necessarily mean that they feel guilty for the wrong they did . They are n't even able to publicly confess and to recount the events of the time in details . You know very well that when you have something on you conscience , talking about it does you good . The weight of it feels much lighter once you 've shared it with someone else .

Therefore , I disappeared again and went there during day time to verify myself . When I got there , it was even hard to find the way as almost everything had been covered by grass ! I just went back home but I never told them where I had gone , I just told them that I had gone to play . So , I just sat there at home .

We were the only Tutsis who lived in that cell ... my father was the only Tutsi who lived there . He was the only one who remained there in 1959 ; all his brothers fled but he remained there because he was studying . And then when he completed his studies he married and ended up the only Tutsi living in the area [ where we were born ] . The genocide started but our neighbours confused us ; during the 1959 war , when my dad came from school , he found when all his brothers had fled . Grandpapa was already dead ; that is what we have been told as their story . It was their Hutu neighbours who came and took him up ; they looked after him , built him a house , gave him back their cows and and when he reached time to marry , they got him a wife . In other words , they were like his parents or his only relatives . They were the closest people he had . He always used to invite them on all special occasions .

Therefore we got confused and ran back . We ascended the hill so they took advantage to kill us . As they were coming behind us , they could knock us by the anklebone . Whoever could not run fast enough and whom they were able to reach would be killed there and then . They started with houses that were there in the valley and burnt them . Then they burnt our sector . There was a joint up there ; it was like a pub in a town centre . When we reached there , we stood acting tough . Then a man who was called Safari hid himself beside the wall , he released one arrow and killed one Interahamwe . Immediately that Interahamwe fell down and when other attackers saw him die , they turned back and ran saying , "@ We are dead . @" We rushed to that injured Interahamwe and hacked him with all the anger . The rest of the Interahamwe took off and we also chased after them until they crossed the hill . That night they [ Nterahamwe ] held a meeting and called the Gako barracks . We heard buses coming and people singing , "@ We are coming to finish you and finish you completely @"@ . We figured that they had reinforced their troops and that it was our death . We saw one battalion that they had sent because they knew that they could not manage us . We went down the valley , this time they confused us the way they had done before , they pretended that they feared us . This time they could walk towards us and pretend they feared and were going back . They did this several times and then finally came down the hill very fast . We shouted telling them to come down the hill and meet us ; they began to trick us by shooting arrows slowly in order to come closer to us . Within no time , there appeared soldiers from nowhere . These soldiers were near us and ready to shoot . Therefore , their leader [ I am not sure if it was their leader ] shot one bullet with a pistol . And immediately after , gun shots followed . All of us got confused and we were scattered . That is when I realized that things had changed for the worst . In fact I came to realize that Kayumba lost so many people that day . We started running , we got scattered and mixed up . That day people were killed in a big number and in my heart I thought @: whoever survives this day will be a real man .

Those perpetrators were all from the tribe called Bakiga and they wondered why I was going to that home . "@ Maybe those cows in that home belong to her family ! @" they were guessing . And then added , "@ let us go and ask that man to give us a cow in order to leave him with the kid . @" They came and took another cow but it was still the same way ; one would hack and the other one would take another part till when the cow is finished . Sometimes they would leave part of the cow on the ground and go .

A friend of mine called Alivera came and told me she did n't think it was a good idea to let them cross the border . She said that although Munyensanga had n't said exactly when she was leaving , she had told them she was fleeing with Edouard . She advised me not to let them go as they 'd know I sent my brother away with Munyensanga and they were going to kill me . "@ His family will not be happy to hear that you sent them to the Inkotanyis @"@ , she said . I ended up not sending Edouard , I was selfish and I sent him back to Kibuye . I told him it would be too dangerous for me when they find out . He begged me to take him to Immaculée but he refused . Edouard went back to Kibuye and looked for a way to leave from there but never succeeded . That was the last time I saw him , he went to Kayove after that , he was scared to go back home and he went to hide in Kavoye where mom is from , in a place called Nkurutu . He went to hide there and the war occurred before he went back home and that 's where he was killed .

I think about such things when life has become very hard on me .
Cyane numvaga aricyo gisubizo . ||| Yeah , very often ! That was the best solution for me .

Ubumwe n' Ubwiyunge nuko bwa kunga abanyarwanda , bukabasubiza...bukabasubiza...bu...ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ni uko bwakunga abanyarwanda , bagasubira bakabana nk' uko byari mbere , bakabana n' abo bahemukiye , bakabasaba imbabazi . ||| I think unity and reconciliation should unite the Rwandans so that they live in harmony the way they lived before . People should live with those they betrayed and ask for forgiveness .
Kuko niba wumva ukeneye kugira ngo uzabane n' abantu runaka gusa , icyo gihe ndumva no kuyobora igihugu byagorana cyane . N' umunyarwanda uwo ari we wese bya ntabwo yabasha kubana n' undi . Ubwo twaba dusubiye nko muri ya Période n' ubundi nk' uko imyiryane yagiye iba , abantu bica abandi babaziza ubusa , umuntu akuziza ibyawe .

That means that all Rwandans would n't be able to live with each other . It would be like going back to the time of conflicts when people would kill others without any reason or because of what you own or because of your ethnic group . It was said that due to your ethnic group , you were not allowed to pass in school . To me , that is nonsense . It can not contribute to the development of the country .

No kubera ko na leta uko yajyagaho ari ko yagendaga ibatoteza...idutoteza , tukibaza amaherezo . ||| In short , we grew up knowing that there is no sympathy between the Hutu and Tutsi . We grew up knowing that Hutus are enemies of Tutsis . In fact , our parents used to tell us , "@ Dear children , Hutu are bad people . Look at the kind of life we are living and yet we used to be rich . We used to own cattle and so many other things but now we are poor , we do not own anything . This is not the life we were meant to live . We are like this just because of the Hutu . @" We did n't have any hope of living with the Hutu in community ; I do n't know why maybe it was due to what every Government that was in power subjected us to . We could hardly believe it would one day come to an end .

The world felt too small for me . I used to hear people saying that Inkotanyi were in Nyamiyaga . I would therefore think of a way to get there ... The girls left me and the people we were living with told me to flee with them . "@ You never know , maybe you will see your family members at some point . " they said . By then it was impossible to imagine that you would ever see your family members again . A time came when the war became very bad . And the people I was fleeing with were families of perpetrators running away from the Inkotanyi .
Umh ! [ araseka ] Icyo ni ikibazo gikomeye kuko...ntabwo ... kubabarira ni iby' Imana gusa . Ntabwo njyewe nababarira nk' umuntu . Ndi umuntu ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ndi ... ntabwo ndi umwuka .

Wumva ntawe uri busangire nawe , wabona inzu nini ukabona ibaye ... nta kintu kirimo kuko nta muryango uri buze kugusuramo ... Usanga rero no kuvuga ngo @: 'kubabarira...' wenda wababarira kuko nta kindi wakora . Kandi utababariye se ? Kuko abantu bishe mu ntambara ni 90 % . Ubwo rero wapfa . Warinda wicwa n' umutima ... warwara umutima . Ugerageza kurenzaho gusa . ||| Umh ! [ she smiles ] That 's a tough question . I can not forgive . Forgiveness is from God . I am only human ; I am not some sort of air . All the pain I encounter in life does not leave room for forgiveness . The life we live in today ... You see the good and that reminds you of what happened . You see the bad and it also reminds you of what happened . Even when you get a big house or a lot of money , you have no one to give it to or to share it with . You get a big house but it is empty because no family will come and visit you . So when you think of forgiveness ... Maybe you can forgive because there 's nothing else you can do . And if you do not forgive ... the killers were about 90 % ... It would kill you . You would get a heart attack and die . You just look at it and leave it .

They were left homeless , they should be strong and patience and , mind about their education . I know there is no good life , their heads had frozen . Because , when a child has no parents , life seem to be meaningless . Therefore they should be strong because there is no alternative . If they come across their fellows with the same problems , they should befriend one another and talk about their problems . If it is a parent , she will tell them that , "@ my children come we chat a bit . @" Ever , when you meet with people you experienced the same problem ; you fell relieved just because you found someone to tell about your problems , someone who understands it . That is what I can advise them . Children who faced that problem should love and know each other . If they meet challeges , they should learn how to adress those problems to the older people who were once in the same situation . Because grown @-@ ups know how to comfort children . You can tell a child that , "@ be strong there is no alternative . @" And if you are neighbours , then you try to visit each other . That helps the children to know that there are some other people who faced the same problems like they did .

Here they found that it was easier to use tribes even though they are three . They put one aside say that it meant nothing so they left the Twa alone , they considered the Hutu and Tutsi and gave one side arms and told them to fight eachother . There are places where they used religion like in Sudan . The white man always wanted something that divided the country men into two opposing sides of which they would chose one side to help them .

But when they have heard about it , they are far better than those who never went to school . I guess they are the ones who should be sensitized . Instead of teaching people how to forgive only , they should teach them the origin of everything , and the cruelty of it all . Then everybody will feel concerned in stopping such acts from happing again .
Ibyo ntibiba bishoboka , ariko iyo ubashije kuba ukiriho , ukabasha kuba ufite aho uruhukira .

Numva ari byo bintu byabasha kuba byiza . ||| That is not possible . What matters is that you have a place where to relax or a place where you can host a visitor or a place where to throw parties and host friends because you consider the friends that survived as your family . Of course I am talking about real friends ; they are the closest relatives one is left with . You visit each other and live in a sort of community so that you do n't feel deserted . When people visit you , you chat and when there is an idea to analyze , you do it together and you are happy . If you are working on a project or studying then you do it together . Such things contribute to our own development . I guess that the best thing to do .

For example if I had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to Arusha it is better . if it means to go and witness in Arusha I can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond Rwanda . Lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called Issac . He lives in Ririma . If he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , I can hurry to go there and convict him . I would remind him whatever he did while I was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period . I feel that even the government is delaying me because I am very ready to say the truth on what happened and I feel that I should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too .

I think I no longer trust them because my dad was killed by a Hutu man who was a very good friend to him , such a good friend ... We could not hide ... You know how things are in the countryside ... Whenever the local wine had ripen it , we would n't hide from that man and dad could n't drink it without sharing it with him . They were like brothers , dad once told me that Karonkano 's father ... The man was called Karonkano , he later on acknowledged that he killed dad and asked for fogiveness but I never got to see him , he was imprisoned and he got sick in jail and also passed away . Karonkano was like my dad 's brother , dad once told me that Karonkano 's father and my grandfather had made a pact of blood . I asked him to explain to me what that meant and he said they drunk each other 's blood . Therefore , he said they were brothers and they could never betray each other . It is surprising to know that Karonkano is the one who went ahead and killed dad ... He was among the people who killed dad . He killed Alfred my brother and he did n't at least kill him in good way ... not that there are good deaths , but he did n't kill him completely . He hacked him on the head and on the back and was left agonizing near some hotels that are near our home ; at Kuryanyirakabano . He killed him , he hacked him and left him agonizing ... I was told that Alfred would ask the passersby - most of them were our neighbours - for water ... I think he was very thirsty and he bleeded a lot ... He was still young , he was 15 . He probably thought that despite the fact that they were Hutus , they could be goodhearted Hutus ... Nobody gave him water ! The thing that hurt me the most is that some of our neighbours came back and buried him alive ... So living with them ... I have to live with them since that 's how it needs to be so we can build the country ... But I can never trust the neighbours the way I used to , considering them as other human beings ; the thought seems impossible . I go home at times but there is so much fear in me even then . I feel as though they 'd also kill me if they had the opportunity . It 's impossible , I can not say that I could trust them again . Because if they were human beings , they would n't have killed children such as Ngirabakuniz , she was so young ! I was told that Ngirabakunzi kept telling them ... they told me that those who took her ... I was hurt so much to hear that she was killed by other children ! The oldest in the group that took her must have been about 13 . She was saying , "@ Please forgive me ! I am sorry that dad committed the crime of being a Tutsi , but I promise I will n't be a Tutsi anymore ! @" So I do n't think I can trust our neighbours again ! I will live with them because there 's nothing else I can do about it but I will n't trust them . That 's not possible !

I mean , if everyone respects Human Rights , then there would be no genocide again . And even now I believe there will be no genocide again .

I am 52 years , I am maried and I have children . A big number of people were killed here at Rubirizi . They were so many that we still find their remains till this day , there are still bones all over . In fact , there were many pits in Rubirizi , they served for the feeding of cows . However , the people who were hiding in their villages ... I did n't see the ones who were taken from Biziyaremye 's house , he was the counsellor . The soldiers used to kidnap them and take them to Rubirizi . Among them were our neighbours , most of them were women . There was a road from Kicukiro that passed here , near this put and that went up to Samuduha .

He reached me about seven o'clock one evening ; When I saw him , I felt overcome with grief and I felt like crying , I kept myself from crying because I did n't want them to see me cry , when he greeted me I almost broke down and cried , I replied his greeting , he had a lot of money because he was preparing for his wedding ; you see , he still had all the money , his fiancé had already been killed , he took his wallet out of his pocket ; I am not sure he was going to give me some money but as he took out his wallet , an Interahamwe named Bizuru quickly came up to him he was carrying a machete , he then led him down towards the pediatric ward , those who know a little history about Kibuye know about a very large pit they called Onapo , just behind the windows of where we were living

All the people who were caught were burnt there ; they would pour petrol on them while they were standing and they would burn them . That was the place where they would train Interahamwe how to use guns . They ordered others to use pickaxes . Next to that place is where the local counselor was living ; we would call it 'at the counselor 's . @" But I did n't know him ; I just used to hear that it was at the counselor 's . They made people dig holes ; once one would dig a pit of his or her height , he or she would enter into the hole and they would just put soil above when someone is still alive . Meanwhile , some Hutu kids who had come from Byumba accused me of being a Tutsi . I overheard them saying they were going to call the Interahamwes to come and kill me . They went to call them [ the Interahamwes ] at night . In fact , I overheard them saying it through the window . I immediately run away and when I got in the middle of where the Inkotanyis and the soldiers I was with were fighting , I sneaked inside the house of the ‘ counsellor ’ of Jari . When I got inside , there were dead bodies all over the place , that 's where they were keeping them . Since I did n't have anywhere else to go , I hid in the middle of the corpses . When they came , they could not see me . Then they closed the door and went . I spent about 4 hours lying down with those corpses . Then I decided to leave the house after realizing that it was calm . I stayed in the area where the soldiers were fighting . I would hide at the frontline . And that is where I was staying .

I do n't even know that so called Rurangiza , maybe if we met on the way we would pass by each other . So , he [ Ruranngiza ] first asked him what he was .

He was latter taken to CHK [ a hospital ] together with other wounded people and he was dressed .

I was also scared but it reached a point where all the fear went . I reached a point where I felt like I did not know what was going on , or where I was . Seeing a human being killing another one or running after him or her . Seeing them agonizing or having wounds all over their bodies because they cut them down is something I was not capable of grasping or fully understanding . I was so miserable ! There 's a day I kept feeling very sad without really knowing why . I felt very uncomfortable , very confused despite the fact that it had been a good day as no one was chasing after me . I wrote down the date and I later on found out that it was around that time that my family was murdered . I had spent the whole day crying without really knowing why . It was quite a peaceful day as no one had come where we were hiding on that day . But on that day I was not at peace at all , I kept thinking about home , about my brother . I wrote down the date and kept the peace of paper and memorized the date . Later on I found out that it was the time it happened .

Noneho ubwo turarunguruka mbona umuntu bari kwicisha kupakupe [ coupe @-@ coupe ] ahongaho mu mugi wa Nyamata ; ni ukuvuga ngo agahaguruka yahaguruka bakamukubita kupakupe akikubuta hasi , yakongera guhaguruka bakamukubita kupakupe akongera akikubita hasi , mpaka uwo muntu apfuye . Bamukiniraho ngo wa Nyenzi we ngo wajyaga he , mbyumva ndi aho ngaho mu nzu . Noneho ibyo bivaho haza icyo bita gukora , interahamwe zihita kuri utwo ducentres zivuga , ngo @: « tugiye gukora , » bahera ku nzu ya mbere basaka kuri utwo ducentres twa Nyamata , basaka , basaka .. Basaka ... , batwika , inzu y' umututsi cyangwa boutique y' umututsi , yari iy'mututsi bagahita bayishumika bakayitwika . Noneho bahera kuri boutique ya mbere batwika , batwika ... batwika ; noneho jyewe ku mutima ndavunga nti @: sinshaka ko bansanga muri iyi nzu .

Mfata umwuko , icyuko kinini ngishyira ku rutugu , maze kugishyira ku rutugu nshaka gusohoka , nshatse gusohoka abo bagenzi banjye baravuga bati @: "@ waretse batakwicira hanze . @" ||| So , as we piped , we saw someone who was being killed with a machete . That was in Nyamata town . Whenever he would try to stand up , he would be slashed then he would fall down again , he was slashed until he died . They were playing on his mind asking him , "@ You cockroach where were you going ? @" I was silently listening from that house . Later on , they started using the term "@ to work . @" The Interahamwe could pass through the center saying , "@ we are going to work @" [ implying that they are going to kill ] . They started searching house by house in Nyamata center . They searched all around and they burnt houses or shops that were owned by Tutsis in that area . Shops were burnt , one after the other . I said to myself , "@ I do n't want to be found in this house . @" Then in no time they had reached Gahima 's house . [ Gahima was the president of PL in Bugesera ] . His house was very beautiful but it was burnt to ash . It was ignited and I saw its flames . The Interahamwe burnt house after house to the point where , in the end , they were going to reach us . But I did n't want to wait to see the Interahamwe getting me alive and see myself dying a painful death . I decide to die running . Then I reached for a spatula [ made out of wood , about two meters long ] that was in that house , which they used for stirring while making the local beer . I held the spatula across my shoulders and tried to get out . When the people who were in the house saw that I was going to get out , they stopped me . "@ Why do n't you stay here , do you want to die from outside ? @" they asked me .

As I was lying down , I stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . There were only floods of blood .

When you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts . It is time for every Rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country . They should love each other as Rwandans . Rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country . Conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation .

It seemed escaping from the rain under a sweating tree . Munyakazi came with Renzaho . He sent Interahamwe into the church . They started seating us in the very church and picking up people whom they packed in the red pickup he has often evoked . They carried them in eight rounds till they saw strong young men had almost finished . They mainly took young men

Ikintu rero cyitwa ubunyangamugayo ni ikintu gikomeye cyane . Ubundi uri n' inyangamugayo ntanubwa wakagombye no kunywa inzoga ngo usinde ; akantu korohe ; ntanubwo wanabona umwana ngo umukubite kuko uba uri inyangamugayo ; wamugira inama kuko inyangamugayo ni ikintu gikomeye nkurikije uko hari abasaza twajyaga tuganira ngo mu gihe cya kera bitwaga inyangamugayo ; babaga ari abantu koko b' inyangamugayo . Ubwo rero inyangamugayo ; biravugwa ahantu hose ; hari ubwo mperutse kumva ngo hari ibihumbi bingahe baherutse guhagaritse kubera ruswa ; None nasabaga yuko rwose Leta yashishoza ikareba inyangamugayo koko ; ntabwo izaza mu mutima w' umuntu ariko nanone hari ikindi kintu Curteur bashobora gufatiraho . Nk' umuntu udafitanye isano na Genocide ; ni ukuvuga ngo uta ; utaragize uruhare na rukeya muri Genocide ; cyangwa se umuntu ; abanyarwanda turi benshi ; cyangwa se umuntu udafitanye isano n' abantu bishe aah ; abantu bafitanye isano n' interahamwe . Aho ndashaka kuvuga gutya nshobora kuba ndi inyangamugayo koko ; ariko data wacu akaza kuburana ; data wacu naza kuburana rwose nzahumiriza ; kuko ari data wacu . Aho rero icyo kintu bakagombye kucyitaho ; ikindi nanone bakwitaho ; bakareba abantu ; bakareba amashuri bafatiraho . ||| What is called ubunyangamugayo [ the fast of being a person with integrity ] it 's not an easy task . Actually the fact of being "@ Inyangamugayo @" [ Honest volunteer ] , you are not allowed to drink beer . You are not even allowed to hit a child because you are an honest person . The Inyangamugayo nowadays are different from the old men in the old time that were called Inyangamugayo . These old men known as Inyangamugayo were really honest . I once heard that a thousand of them were arrested because of corruption . I ask the government to carefully choose a really Inyangamugayo . I am sure the government is not able to look in their hearts but there are some criteria to follow . Like choosing a person who is not related to Genocide , I mean the one who was not involved in any of the acts of Genocide or a person related to few people , another thing not related to Interahamwe . If it happens that I am Inyangamugayo and I have to judge a member of my family , I will do it in the right way . So this thing should be followed up , also they should set the school level they must complete .

And after we saw our parents being killed , our sisters and other people ... when we realized that all people were finished . All the fear disappeared . The only problem remaining was why you did n't die with the rest . I remember this man called Nyarusenge who came and told me he wanted to help me flee so I would n't die ; he said he was going to take my brother somewhere else . I was still very young but I could understand that he either wanted me to become his wife or he had in mind to rape me . He had a club they called Nta mpongano y' Umwanzi [ a spiked club ] . He asked me to enter the house and wait for him . I was so hurt ! What shows that all fear was gone is the way I replied him so rudely , "@ I can not do that ! @" I think that 's the reason why we left that place ... when we realized that things were going so wrong . They were saying that they would come to rape me . When my brother heard about that ... I was scared about that ... we decided to go and be killed elsewhere . During the genocide , I was n't scared most of the time . I told him , "@ If you feel like killing me then just go ahead and kill me . My parents are now dead , they were educated people , they had degrees ... you were among the attackers who came to kill them yet you once lived together , they once fed you , you were friends . And now you want to use me in any way of your wish . @" I went on and told him , "@ I 'd rather be killed than becoming your wife or fleeing with you . @" He entered the house , very angry saying that he had the rights to kill me . Then I asked him that , "@ Why do n't you kill me ? @" He just kept quiet and left . But they were waiting for the nightfall to kill us . It could even be that they were thinking of other ways of mistreating me or both of us . I was with my brother . But God helped us and and we left in the morning . They never found us . It shows that in reality , we were n't scared . By then , all fear was gone .

I may not be able to tell you what I went through in my mother 's womb , but from the time I was born , they used to tell me about my childhood . Well , I was the last @-@ born . It is said that last @-@ born children always stress their parents ; they easily fall sick . I was told myself I used to be very sickly . People would run around looking for medicine . I also heard that my mum died when I was very young . I had not yet reached time to join primary school . But by then , my dad was still alive . Therefore , we lived with him . He always used to draw me near him wherever he was and wherever he went . Sometimes he could even take me at his working place because I was too young to be left alone and also , he was the only parent that we had . So he had to look after me , take good care of me and so on . When time came to go to school , he took me to school like other children . Then in 1994 the war started and by then I had n't joined secondary ; I was still in primary . I remember I had sat the National Primary Leaving examinations P.L.E. By then primary school would stop at the sixth level . Level 8 had been removed . Therefore I was waiting for my results but unfortunately enough that is when the catastrophes of 1994 started . I guess you too can imagine how my childhood was .

Now they would be helping the counntry and our country would develop like other countries . Therefore , forgeting the genocide is a big mistake . Once you forget the genocide it seems like you do n't value Human Rights . Because you can never obey Human Rights yet you do n't accept so and so as a human being . Therefore , considering genocide means considering people as human beings and not animals . And respecting people as human beings . That is all I can say .

They called them different tribes which were against each other . They also said that every bad thing that happened in Rwanda especially during their time was caused by the Tutsi be it the caining of offenders . All those things that happened because of the colonialists were blamed on the Tutsi .

The war had ended by then , dad went back to Rwanda to check how things were and he came back and told us the house had been destroyed . We had some neighbours with whom we shared everything who had been killed but their house was still there . Him and I came back to Rwanda but mother , the newly born baby and the child who had been hit by a club remained behind . They later on joined us there and we went back to living a normal life although they were still shooting here and there . After sometime , we moved back to our own house .

I used to enjoy watching them using their guns , there is nothing I enjoyed more than that .

Therefore , you have to kill all Tutsis and wipe them out . @" After he said so , I recalled everything grandpa used to tell me . Immediately I went back with the car that was going back to the camp . The camp was near our home . When I got home , I found when they would hide during the day and come back at night . And whenever I would inquire what was going on , no one would answer me .

A military man who was from home got involved , they took me to the police station and questionned me about my involvement with the Inkotanyis . I told them I did n't know them and probably due to the fact that I was still very young , I was only 17 , they did n't keep me there for long . I was at the police station for only 3 days with other young people who were in school in Congo who had been arrested as well as many other people they had captured in Gisenyi . Among them was the Manager of Sulfo Gisenyi [ a cosmetic industry ] . I have met him , he 's still alive . He survived . They ended up releasing me and some of my friends . But in my mind I knew I was going to become some sort of an outcast after having been in jail . And that 's exactly what happened , I was no longer free to move around as I wanted to . Whenever I 'd reach a roadblock - Gisenyi was full of roadblocks then because things were very tensed , we were almost in 1994 - I 'd ... I decided to just remain inside the house . I never even went back home to see dad . I was too scared that Munyensanga 's family would harass me or that I 'd even be imprisoned for wanting to help Edouard flee .

Other soldiers [ Inkotanyi ] joined them in order to give them a hand , in the afternoon that is when the remaining group managed to cross . On the way going , some people like the wife of Manyenzi , another girl lost their lives due to the shooting ; some were caught by the bullets because we were a long chain of people . We went and reached Gisozi , We were welcomed . If I go back a little bit , the 30 people who stayed at Saint Paul saying that it was Interahamwe trying to fool us were killed almost all of them . One man called Ally was one of the few people that survived the Interahamwe attack . He does n't know how he survived all he remembers is that he slept down and they started to kill people . So for us we reached Gisozi . The young men became soldiers and the old women and others were taken to Kabuga . I was one of the young adults that became soldiers . The war [ Genocide ] came to an end . We did not stay longer as soldiers ; some were still young so want to return to school . The main purpose was to quit the army because we felt kind of traumatized when remembering that someone had a family of ten people now he is left alone .

Even though we were the only [ Tutsi ] family in the area , they did n't take advantage of that . Fathers would warn their sons not to kill us because of a ritual pact of blood never to betray each other they had signed with our parents . So they would n't kill us although they had the intention to do so . Some of their sons became Interahamwe ; they even went for training and when they came back , they just wanted to finish us . Leaving us alive was partly due to the cowardice of Rwandans , the fear to be the one to start off the fire . They would say , "@ I can not be the one to kill them first @" due to historical reasons . But later , they were the ones to commit the terrible murders .

The war went on and at some point they began shooting . The Inkotanyi came to Runda while I was there . During the time of shootings , we all fled together . I thought of staying in the house alone and thought it would be hard . We again crossed over to a certain place ... Runda was next to Taba and Taba was my home village . We passed there and went further . We reached a place called Kanyinya , where we found a roadblock . At the roadlock they would stop people and look into the palms of kids who were not yet able to get identity cards . When they looked into mine , they asked me , "@ Where do you come from ? @" I lied to them and gave them wrong names of my parents . Then they let me go . We continued our journey and reached Nyabikenke and Bulinga . We went through all those areas . When we reached Gisenyi , we turned back as it seemed like the war had calmed down .

Therefore , those things can be so hurting . When it comes to a tough problem of tracing a living , especialy on special days . For example , some children mature and reach a time of marrying . Those children begin saying , "@ I wish I at least had an aunt or one of my parents . @" It becomes a very big problem . There are several problems in fact everything reminds those days .

That is when I got out of that place . I thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing I was waiting for . Then I thought , " Let me find a way of protecting myself and see if I would survive . @"

They broke doors and started getting people down in order to kill them . I was called and I went there . I found two families that had just been taken to the reception desk to be killed . I may even tell you the families so that you may ask them yourself .

I guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it . Still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ I got such and such problem . @" But since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do .
Wagize ikibazo bakakumaraho umuryango icyo nikindi kintu kigikomere giteye ubwoba aha nagirango umpe ishusho y' abapfakazi ba jenocide babayeho ubu bari mungaruka zikomeye cyane . ||| Who went through the same and lost your whole family which is a very difficult thing to endure , I would like you to paint a picture for us of the genocide widows who are suffering the hard consequences .

Ikintu na...ikindi nakwibukira ku bavandimwe banjye , ni uko umwana witwa Angélique , yari umwana ubona adasanzwe , yari afite ubwenge bwinshi muri we ... afite ubwenge bwinshi muri we . Ndibuka ko yajyaga akina umukino witwa dame ... dame ngirango abantu barayizi benshi , yajyaga akina dame n' abantu bakuze . Bafite nk' imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu...mirongo itatu . Ni umukino usaba ubwenge , usaba gutekereza . Ariko yarawukinaga abantu bose akabatsinda . Ari umwana , icyo ndabyibuka ko yigaga mu wa kabiri yari mu mashuri abanza , yakinaga n' abantu benshi akabatsinda . Ikindi mwibukiraho yari umwana ufunguye cyane mu mutwe , ku buryo kuva kera yari azi gutandukanya indirimbo , navuga nka sorte z' indirimbo . Yakumva iyi akavuga ngo ni funk , ukumva ngo ni rock , akaba azi ngo ni zouk akiri muto , akabikunda agakunda kubyina cyane . Abantu benshi bakamukunda , akiga muri maternelle [ ibinyoni ] hari abantu bigishaga ahongaho bajya bamujyana kuri lac , bakamujyana i Gisenyi , bakamujyana ku Kibuye yari umwana ushimishije cyane .

Kandi yapfuye afite imyaka mike , yapfuye afite imyaka icumi gusa . ||| Another thing I recall about my relatives , Angélique was an extraordinary child . She was very bright . I remember she was good at playing draughts ; it is a very popular game . She would play with twenty @-@ five or thirty @-@ year @-@ old people . It a game that requires thinking . But she would win over them all yet she would be the youngest . I remember she was in primary two . She won over many people . I remember she was a very sharp child ; she knew how to distiguish different types of music at a very young age . I mean types of music ; she could listen to music and tell which one is Funky , which is Rock and which is Zouk . She also enjoyed dancing a lot and most people liked her . While she was still in nursery school , her teachers used to take her to the Lake in Gisenyi or in Kibuye . She was such an interesting child that almost everybody liked her . She knew how to sing and how to make friends as young as she was . She left us special memories , we shall always remember her . The other children had a more quiet spirit . However , she was different , she was more noisy . It was easy to forget she was just a child looking at her ability to reason like an adult . No one considered her to be young . But , she died so young ; she was only ten years old .

You separated those who wanted to go to the side of Inyenzi and those who wanted to go to the government . Realizing that the number of those who wanted to the Inyenzi 's side was bigger , you became angry and moved your spectacles . You talked to Renzaho . I do not know what you said . Only you know . You even immediately left .

Besides , we were almost all knew each other because the majolity had come from the same school . Of course some were younger than others . One day , one of the boys in my dormitory insulted me about my mother . When he did , I did n't feel anything at the moment , I just laughted . But at night I thought about it , it was as though my brain was widening ; I recalled the past , I thought about my current life and I started asking myself why or what I was struggling for . I thought , "@ I have no sister , no brother , I have no father , no mother . @" I did n't see why I was studying ! I remember that time , I never slept and the whole day I was thinking about that ; I did not study that day , I was in class but absent minded . I remember I spent about three hours out of class ; I was chased out of class because I was n't taking notes . When I went to bed that night I could n't sleep , I could n't talk . They took me to Kabgayi hospital but it was all in vain . They took me back home ; at the hospital they said I did n't have any problem . I spent six months without talking , I was used to communicate through writing .

I told her that if I lost my mum and dad , it 's not because they were dogs . I told her that I did n't think telling her my problems could be helpful . We almost quarrelled . Then she said that I am undisciplined but I simply kept quiet . Later I saw coming to me with a polythene bag . Inside the bag , there were soaps and other small things for school use . But still , what she brought was almost nothing . Sincerely the things she brought us were n't an awful lot . I know I do n't have to go to school with extraordinary school material like the ones that rich kids bring at school . If I carry a washing soap , then that is enough for me . She gave us ten washing soaps and three small Colgate . Each of us got her share .

When we arrived there , the grandmother told me that I could n't spend the night in her house . At sunset , she threw me out . She asked me to go and look for another shelter . Then I realised that it was not safe to stay in a region I did not know and that I could not hide anywhere because I did n't know where to hide . In fact she took me to a certain place but I did not trust her ; I thought she would send me perpetrators to kill me .

Then we heard the perpetrators in our cattle we had left home . They hacked them and the people we left home . I heard them hacking them [ the elderly people they had left home ] . We hid in a bush near home because they were already coming near us . First they hacked the men and meanwhile , we run to the sector 's offices at the Ntarama church . But even as we were running , we heard some of them behind us saying , "@ They passed here . There they are . @" And others entered the bush to search for us but luckily they found properties such as suitcases , bags and many others that people had hidden there . We heard them telling each other , "@ Hey ! I discovered some treasures here . @" So as they were concentrating on what they found we found a way to the sector in Ntarama at the church and that 's how we managed to survive that day . In fact , that was the day the war in Nyamata toughened because all the survivors fled to the schools . That is the day they killed my mum and dad and all the people who had hid home . They killed around 20 people . We preceded to the sector . When we reached at the sector ... at the school ... sorry , at Ntarama church .

She was tall and slim and wherever she would pass they would attempt killing her . They would let her go after mentioning her brother because he was known as a colleague whom they worked together . So she would come home after they released her . Then the brother told her , "@ Therese , you have to stay with this kid . She should never fail to get water for bathing or food to eat . You should be together wherever you may be . @" Her sister agreed . She took me to the bedroom , washed me , and gave me food to eat . Then I slept . At around 11:00 o'clock , the other old woman came [ the one whom we first lived together ] she coming looking for us from every where because she was told that , "@ Gahizi 's children died from some place . @" She heard it from the people who passed us from where we were seated . They imagined we later died . Therefore , those people went straight to that old lady [ the mother to Munyagishali ] and told her that , "@ the other kids who were here , must have died . Because we saw them while we were passing by and in a few minutes we saw one lying down and the other one disappeared . Maybe she died somewhere else . @"

During that time , the Hutu were on power . Even before the war , they were the ones in the leadership of the country . Their main goal was to teach how Tutsis were bad . Generally that was the main lesson . People were first shown how the Tutsi used to lead during the monarchy .

In short you feel so useless . I remember one day even saying that I should have died , as the dead at least were silent , they were fine .

Come and play with other kids . @" and I would say , "@ no I do n't want . @" Sometimes I would go back home at around 10:00 . Break time would reach and then other students would get into groups then I would remain alone . Therefore , after a small time I would go home .

Then she asked me , "@ Where is your older sister ? @" I told her that by the time they drowned us , we were together but I do n't know what happened to her later . Therefore , my mum and I stayed there and two days later , my older sister also came . My mum asked her how she came . She told her that she was coming from somewhere across the river , in a place called Nyagatovu . The three of us remained together . Actually , the man in that family was not being hunted . He was the one to hide us and his wife was an aunt to mum and she was also among the group of hunted people . Since her husband was a Hutu , he was not threatened . We all continued to hide there ; my mum , my older sister and I. Later ... it was in ... it was still in April in the middle of the war . Then in May , the man [ husband to her mum 's aunt ] said , "@ I do not want to be accused of being Inkotanyi . All of you go . @" He told his wife if she believed she had to continue hiding us , then she should leave with us .

He insisted that he wanted to go with them but he was too young to join the army . They just went with him . We were living in Byimana and he was across in Gahengeri . Some day , those boys were walking around in Byimana and saw me by chance . They met my mum and sister and after confirming that we survived , they went and brought him to us . Since then we have been living together . I guess you can now tell how many we are now ; two of us had survived , [ my sister and I ] then we got our young brother , plus our mum . Therefore , we are four . Later we heard that our first @-@ born sister who was married survived . We met her in Kinazi when we were going to a place called Rwabusoro towards Bugesera .

How I can say in few words then , at first both republicans followed the plan of colonialists and fulfilled it and went on towards Genocide . It means to separate Rwandans , a Tutsi is not Rwandan and that he has to die . And then they came up with a way of talking about him , the way he is , that he is bad , in all the ways they painted him to be a bad person and they taught it to others and it went into all kind of teachings that we know but they come to make it understandable that he does n't deserve to live .

[ Rwanda is trying to do the same ] in the memorial centre , there are 60 million candles , which are always lit and each candle represents a person who died in the genocide that took place there [ holocaust ] . And on every candle , there is a name of the victim . Which implies that , every person who died in the genocide was taken into consideration and still counts . It is in that case that I appeal to all Rwandans at large to fight against those who deny that there was genocide . Therefore my message is forwarded to the government ; I will excuse myself because I am going to talk about the leaders of this country . To me it seems to be a big problem ; leaders always talk about reconciliation yet they can never come down to us ; people like us we know much about the children 's testimonies but since these leaders never come down to us and hear that message from low class people , or see those orphans ... most of them [ leaders ] get about 300,000Rfw or 400,000Rfw but you can never catch him [ a leader ] take the initiative of taking an orphan , instead he selfishly keeps that money . This is the message I can give to the leaders . Leaders should reduce the words they speak and put what they say into action .

She was a "@ born again Christian . @" She liked praying so much ; all I would hear her say was , "@ Jesus Christ @"@ . And my brothers were next to each other ; they were made to sit in a line like this ... I heard people screaming besides . I remember my aunt ... there was no other way but if I had had help , she would have survived . She died in the banana plantation but I too was helpless , I could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant . For her she still had some strength to breathe .
Harya ubundi ufite imyaka ingahe ? ||| How old are you ?
Ariko bafite naza............nyinshi ....... Ariko kugirango ngewe nshobore gutabara bariya baturage . ||| There were also .... A lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned ,

Hari ikibazo kindi cyerekana ko byari biturutse ku bwoko bwanyu ? ||| Is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ Tutsi ] ?

Ubona iterambere ry' igihugu ... mbese igihugu cyacu aho kigana wumva wagira icyo ubivugaho ? ||| Let us proceed . I would like to ask you another question . Whatever maybe the case , a nation is built by its natives when they put their hands together . And as you said earlier that after the genocide , some people divided themselves into separete divisions . Which divisions , seem to be helpless as far as developing our country is concerned . So , what can you talk about the development of our country ... what can you predict about her future ?
Ijwi ntiryumvikana ! ||| Q ...

His name must be Ntirugiribambe Samuel ; I guess . You were standing nearby . He was brought there . Others were immediately shot at in the very place .

Tuzi iwawe mu rugo ko nta mwana ko nta ... n' uwo wigeze wigera umwana usa utya mu rugo rwawe . @" ||| I stood in front of them , trembling and feeling weak due to fear . I would imagine how I was going to die ... killed by hundreds of people . I would look at myself and see how small I was and compare it with all those men carrying several weapons , then I would wonder , "@ how will I die ... ? How will I die ? @" I would imagine one taking out my eye and another one doing other weird thing to me ... then I would wish that , if it was possible ... I used to watch films and see how people who die being shot , die in a nice way . It is just a single shot and one dies straight away without a clue on what happened . Therefore , I would look around and wonder , "@ Is n't there someone with a gun to fire me with just a single bullet now ? @" I sat down because I had failed to stand due to fear ; I was shaking so hard and I would fall down . Therefore , two of them came and made me stand . One held here and the other one held here . Then they said to the old man , "@ Mr. Munyagishari , you have been telling us that there is no Gahizi 's child here . So , tell us the background of this kid . Tell us all about how you got her because we know that in your home there is no child who ... you have never had a child who looks like this in your home . @"
Nyuma , noneho bakajya baza kubera ko hari hariho urugamba hari Inkotanyi , bakaza bagafata abantu...Interahamwe zirirwaga mu kigo abasirikare bari imbere barimo kurwana , zikazana abantu zikabicira munsi y' ikigo , ahantu hari ikibuga cya jandarumeri .

Nyuma y' ahongaho naraje ndaza ... hari ahantu hari akabande hagati hari ahantu hari akabuga ... ||| The war went on , the soldiers were fighting against the Inkotanyi in the hills . Meanwhile , the Interahamwe would take local people and kill them in the camp just where there is a football field that used to belong to the state police . One evening some cooking oil was brought for the soldiers . Then they said that , there is no logic in eating good food while their father has died [ President Habyarimana ] . Then they filled several drums with oil and put them on fire . Then they would choose the short Tutsis and dump them in it and burnt them alive . I was terrified ! Therefore , I decided to move forward , towards where the war was taking place . When I got there , I did n't know how to move on my stomach like I would see others doing ... when I saw some of the people I was with being shot dead , I decided to go back . When I got there there , I found so many kids who had come from their homes in the neighbourhood to join the army . Then some Interahamwe came to investigate on all the kids . They picked all the kids , me included . Since the soldier [ who had taken me there ] was there , he talked on my behalf telling that I do n't come from that area when they were almost taking me . Then some people said that I was born there , that they even knew me . I remember there was a certain Interahamwe who said that he knew me that I was Kayiranga 's son but I did n't know who Kayiranga was . He told them that they got me from Byumba when the Inkotanyi had killed all my parents , and that the refugees had taken me there . Immediately they took me out and took the rest of the kids . One kid escaped them but unfortunately , he took off through a place full of land mines and they killed him . And all the rest were murdered .

Ibyo bintu buri gihe iyo mbitekereje birambabaza cyane . ||| The thing that hurts the most as far as my parents are concerned is the way they died . I was told that when they came to get them , my mother had been sick with malaria , she did n't have medication and she had been shivering and throwing up the whole night and they came that morning . My big brother was moping the floor and listening to the radio even though they were hiding . What hurts the most about my father is that they shot him five bullets and he was there agonizing for two days with no medication . He was just there and there was no enough medication . Two days later when he started to feel better , they came back and finished him . It hurts me and I always feel like it would have been better if he had died right away without going through so much pain . Those are the two most painful things .
Mu gihe kizaza numva ... ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ari icyo nzakora , ahubwo numva hari ibyo natangiye...numva ibyo ari byo byose usibye yuko , nk' umuntu ukunda igihugu ngomba gukorera igihugu cyanjye .

Nagize amahirwe sindi ikimuga , ayo mahirwe nagize rero ngomba kuyakoresha mu rwego rwo kwitangira abandi . ||| In the future ... I would n't put it as something I will do in the future since I have already started doing it . Besides , as a patriot I desire to work for my country . I will have to invest a lot more efforts because I know many of the survivors have a lot of problems . Therefore , I am ready to work for them my whole life . I will use my energy , I am lucky I am not handicapped . Therefore , I want to be able to make use of the luck I have in helping others .
Gouvernement z' uRwanda za MDR parmehutu na MRND ||| I mean the governments of Rwanda during the time of MDR PARMEHUTU and MRND .

After the signing of Arusha agreement , MRND and CDR continued to refuse the agreement of power sharing with RPF . During that time , MRND and CDR continued to stay away from those agreements and maintained their programme of exterminating Tutsis and rejecting agreements as well as training and equipping their militias .

There was Yari Gahima , he is the one who conquered those areas and others , therefore you see that if one starts to talk about everyone and what they did , it will be lengthy , I can not say it all , but you realize that they had that plan of conquering for Rwanda and that is what it means , even when you look at their chronicles and think about their names , that is how they were and that is how it is in the plans . Let 's say the name Rwanda , Kigali and Gasabo , those names are similar and all have that program . Rwanda means a country without boundaries , one can ask you that how is the Rwanda abroad ?

From August 1994 to January 1995 I continued to live there where I was when the war stopped . My sister and I continued to live there together . They somehow wanted to make us their slaves ... the war begun when I was in primary four . Then they stopped me from going back to school . Though my sister was n't so old , she was slightly wiser than me . Then she asked , "@ How shall we live this kind of life ? They can n't allow you to go to school ; neither did they allow me ... All they wanted us for was to collect grass for their cows , to dig , to fetch water , generally to do all the domestic work . That was what they expected from us and to them that was the reason why they were taking of us .

They saw me sitting there ; they asked me why I was sitting there yet they had sent me a while ago . Then a certain soldier got out and told me to enter the car . That is how I escaped them . Then in the morning they came and said that my whole family had died and that I was a Tutsi too ; they were wondering why I joined the army . When they found out details about me , I escaped them and joined the refugees . When I reached there ... because I had refused to join the refugees whose origin was Shyorongi , I joined those from Byumba . When they started asking me where I was coming from , I told them that I was coming from Byumba and that the Inkotanyis had killed both my parents using clubs . Some women liked me very much and treated me so well . Then I joined the refugees who were heading to Byumba .

Until when a digging season reached and she would send to the garden for weeding . I would spend the whole day going through my agony ... I would think about that all the time and it would never finish . I felt like I should think about those events only . I never wanted to forget about it even a single moment . I would imagine how they died , how they rested , I would imagine how they bare no more problems and then imagine how I was going to suffer . I would try to see the life I was gong to lead but I would not get it . I would see a group of people coming like attackers ... that time they were not using dogs ; they were hunting people by themselves . They would go to suspects ' homes , to the sorghum plantations ; they would go there by themselves . It had reached tome of harvest and some sorghum was cut down . And it seemed very clear in the plantation . I knew I was going to die . I asked myself , "@ where will I go ? @"

Then later I started recalling what had happened , all that had happened to Boniface ; how he was killed . I began wondering if I was dreaming or if it was real . I spent a long time thinking about it .

I would hear others shouting only once and for all .

That time they took a large number of young men among which , Muyoboke Bosco , another one called Hategekimana also known as Nyarisaza , including Gasindi , another one called Twaha and another one called Mutarambirwa . Among those seventy people was included an old man called Murasadonyi who was one of the few old people that were taken . They were taken to be killed inside a man called Yaremye 's big building located in Kiyovu residence . They were buried inside that building . It was on 14th , the same day Kameya got killed .

Because some of the things that used to hurt us ... for example there are some foreigners who used to come here in AVEGA . And they would ask permission to meet us because they realy wanted to see those people who were victimised by the genocide . The Jews also came to see us ; among those who came , there was a lady ... I do n't remember other people who came with her but some time ago , they also experienced genocide like we did . One of them told us that , "@ my grandparents are victims of the holocaust . According to what we saw and heard , we thought that in Rwanda we would find when people had gone crazy . We thouhght that , it would be very hard to get close to you . But surprisingly you look good ! You are still able to wear a smile ! @" and for sure , she was astonished . However , there was another person who came and told us that , "@ we do n't agree that what happened here was genocide . According to what we heard that happened here , we do n't believe it was genocide . @" Therefore , that denial of the genocide would terribly hurt us because we would n't imagine why they would denay genocide yet it happened ! So what amases us is the fact that all nations agreed and realised that genocide happened in Rwanda . It is so amasing . And among the things that keep me strong , is commomerating the genocide all the time .

MDR @-@ PARMEHUT , RADER , and PROSOMA . However MDR @-@ PARMEHUTU was a Hutu party and UNAR was for tutsi . Members of UNAR party were on the king 's sid ; those are the people who were in the king 's party . Therefore those Hutus were against UNAR . And then later the Hutus became more powerful than the Tutsi because they got support from the Belgians . They abused the tutsi and destroyed their houses . On the Tutsi 's gate there was a picture of a tutsi in white clothes and on the Hutu 's gate there was a red piece of cloth . There were airplanes everywhere in the skies . Therefore those colors were to help them identify between the Hutu 's home and the Tutsi 's home . They would put the red piece of cloth in front of the house and hung it in a tree . Therefore , they would tell it was a Hutu 's house and the one with out one , they would tell it was a Tutsi 's home . Even Hutus from other areas would tell the tutsi 's home and burn it . They would eat cattle and even killed them [ Tutsis ] . That was the reason why some people fled in 1959 ; because they were subjected to torturend . The Tutsi ethnic was tortured . Still it was the Hutus torturing and killing the Tutsi . The situation continued like that till 1960s ...

I felt like I did not have a life . There was no one to protect me , no one to care about me , no one to talk to me . Being alone then , and I was only fourteen years old , all by myself . I felt so lost ! It was as though I did not know where I was or what was going on . I was so confused . I remember the day I saw three girls being thrown down from a tall building . I had to be calm so that they do not notice me and catch me too . I always remember such instances . At that time I was alone , there was nobody I could tell what I had witnessed . Even the times I went to people 's homes , I did not have time to tell about it all . I used to see such things and I would keep silent . I would just go and sit down and keep silent . I could not tell anybody what I had seen .

There is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten . That is impossible . It is a good ceremony because ... whenever that period comes , people always say , "@ At such a time , disasters occurred in this country due to this or that reason . @" That act of commemoration for those who died in the genocide ... constitutes an example to other nations...it gives an example to other countries and they get a chance to judge that what happened to our country was terribly wrong and should never happen again . I find that ceremony very important because it helps people to predict our country 's future and it helps us to avoid its reoccurring .

It is impossible , how can you kill my wife ? She is not a Tutsi .

Therefore , while we were milking cows , we saw sparks rising above the airport and suddenly joined up in the air and ignited . Then , objects in flames started falling downwards , which from a distance looked like a polythene material falling on the ground . Those who were grown up like my cousin who was quite intelligent and who had gone to school said , "@ This is not a sign of peace . @" Everybody around said so . Then we went to bed and in the morning , the news that President Habyarimana 's aircraft had crashed and spread all over . Eh ... What happened next ? All the evil plans that were in their hearts were put out in open .

It is evident that many people were killed there . I escaped death then . Those people were our neighbours .

They will help us never forget what took place in Rwanda . You have just asked me the question " What can you tell a person who does n't agree that genocide happened in Rwanda ? @" I guess you heard that the answer was based on the memorial sites ; I told you that I would take such people to the memorial sites and ask them if those people committed suicide or if the bones are for decoration . These memorial sites will be there for years and years . Our children will see them ; Historians all over the world can come for their research and see what happened . Therefore , memorial sites to me as part of the young generation , especially as a genocide survivor , are there to remind us and make us never forget what happened .

I really needed to know news from my brother but found from people that he had joined the army because he was told that I was dead . But my aunt was also living there , my older sister used to live with her . She died before the war , and we all went to Rwampara to mourn her . The whole family came to bury Katumba , I was with my brother , but he went back and I stayed there . I went on Tuesday and the President died on Wednesday . I had just spent one night then the war started . The whole family was there , waiting to end the mourning ... So I decide to come to Kigali to see if there could be any survivor I can see since in Bugesera there was none . There was one man who had come from Bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at Rwampara , I found that one of my aunts was still there . That is when I started gaining some hope since at least I was getting someone to stay with .

Ariko bye gucika , kuko tugomba guhora twibuka abacu , tukibuka n' ibyabaye . ||| Therefore , we stayed there waiting for our fate to come ; each day one would think it was the last da . Believing that if you survive at night , you would die at noon . We lived in such dilema till when the RPF soldiers invaded and liberated us . They took us in SAINT ANDRE [ secondary school ] and that was the end of war . They stopped those killing but the perticipants should be purnished accordingly .... As an exemplary . And secondly , the genocide history should be maintained and we should never forget . Let all the coming generations ever in life learn that "@ there was genocide in Rwanda . @" They should read it from books , hear from the tales of witnesses who will be present by then , but never let the history die . Because we must keep remembering our beloved ones who died and remember what happened .

Akabasha kwemera cyangwa akabasha no kugaragara , ko hari ikintu yakoze ariko atariwe biturutseho . ||| I 'm positive about Gacaca and I really support the idea because I belive that a perpetrator can denounce another one . I think it 's just a way to try to stop people from being afraid or just simplify the situation . But I am sure that if you get a perpetrator somewhere and ask him to tell you exactly what happened bevcause you know that something happened there , he will n't tell you anything ! I think they shoud talk and say exactly what happened and say things like "@ I was here and this is how it was ... @" then he can plead guilty or deny his participation or say that he had been influenced ...

Ni nacyo kintu nabyo mu bimbabaza bya Jenoside icyo kintu nacyo kirambabaza cyane . Kuko mbabazwa n' uko ntabashije kuba byibuze mu rugo , kubona umurambo wabo cyangwa kuba ntarabihambiye cyangwa kuba tutarabahambye nk' umuryango , ibyo bintu birambabaza cyane . Navuga ko batahambwe kuko iyo ufashe umuntu ukamujugunya , ukamujugunya aho ubonye , kandi yari umuntu wiyubashye , wakundaga abantu nta kintu kibi yakoze , nibaza ko ari ibintu ... si uguhamba ni ibintu bibi . ||| I would say that they way they buried them did not please me . In the Rwandan culture , when someone dies , people come and mourn with you . They killed them and threw them into some garbage , so to me they were not buried . That is actually one of the things that really hurt about the genocide . I wish we had at least buried them as a family . I would n't say that they were buried because getting somebody 's body and throwing it anywhere and yet they were some respectable and innocent person is not a burial . It is so wrong !

That 's not a problem but because they take the medications in poor conditions , they end up dying because those medications require a good life as you said . Most of them do n't realize its efficiency .

While the Rwandan family is still small , be it three people that is man , woman and children before they are married is called a home , that you know . After the homes have become many to the level of grandparents , they are called households after the households had become many and populated , one would go and live over there on the hill .

So I told my older sister whom we had run together , " Let 's not spend the night here , it does n't look safe here . How can we sleep here ? @" And then some policemen came and called some of the people who were there .

Ukabikora . ||| Personally , knowing that I am a survivor ... the fact that I survived makes me feel good because I realize that God helped us . It pleases me so much because so many people died . I strongly believe there a reason why God saved us . To me , being a survivor ... is to have the responsibility to stand in the position of the people who died . What do I mean ? I have to be my mum , my dad , my sisters and try to be complete . I have to try and be in their position . I mean , I have to do what I am meant to do , go to school and study and finish my studies , I have to work . If it is to be a sociable person ... I would n't want to hear people saying that my parents left no one behind , or that we are irresponsible . I would n't give a chance to those who thought that they exterminated my family to find us in a shameful position . I can n't find the right way to express it . Standing in the position of both your parents and your siblings who died , being a man is a big responsability . And , I think it is everybody 's resposibility . To stand in the position of those who are gone . Meaning that you do what they were supposed to do . Although you are only one person , you try and do their work as well as yours .

So they based on religion so as to divide the citizens , or tribes like here . They usually wanted places where it was easy to divide the people basing on their tribes and they would also have a side that could overpower the other from which they could get a majority because they always wanted to divide people .

The first republic honestly seemed to continue with the programs of the colonialists . Let 's talk about Kayibanda , he cause divisionism among the Rwandans which gave birth to refugees like I said , it gave birth to tribalism in schools and at work places , and even in 1972 when Habyarimana wanted to over throw Kayibanda and he told lies that the Tutsi had again rioted but the truth is that he had made it up so as to find a way of overthrowing him . When Habyarimana came in , what he added was tribalism and regional discrimination . The other thing he added was the planning of the genocide .

He was the son of Nsengiyumva Innocent . He asked , "@ How could you kill Nicolas and leave his children ? Why did n't you eliminate them all ? @" By then I was in secondary [ form one ] . Then the killers added , "@ Especially his son who goes to school . He knows all the secrets of Inkotanyi . He is part of them . Therefore , he must be killed ! @" My older brother Burabyo Gabriel was hiding at Rusizana 's house . One night Rusizana bought my brother beer while he was supposedly hiding him . Gabriel took the beer and got drunk . Then Rusizana made him talk loudly . The gang of perpetrators , which worked with Shyaka climbed the fence and got inside . They go him and the last word I heard him saying was , "@ Rusizana , why did you betray me ? We fed on the same breast , how could do this to me ? @" From what I heard ; when my mum was breastfeeding Gabriel , Rusizana 's mother stopped breastfeeding him . Therefore , my mother would breastfeed both Rusizana and Gabriel at the same time . They shared the same breast , the way twins do . My brother was about 27 years . He first fought the killers but they stabbed him ; I heard him screaming . There was moonlight , so I quietly followed them , shifting from place to place to see how they would kill him . They killed him at a certain bush but I never went closer to the bush and I could n't see clearly although it was on moonlight . They killed him ; they finished him up .

Nicyo kintu mbona cyahindutse . ||| From what I see , there is a change in the leadership in Rwanda . There is a distinct change in leadership . During the former Government , there were several barriers ; it was a problem to get a school if you were a Tutsi , it was hard to study . But today people have proper access to schools . However , in the aspect of ideology for example ; things never changed at all . It is just because Rwandans never say the truth ; people can appear as lambs yet inside they are beasts . We live together but we do n't trust each other . But as far as freedom studying is concerned much has improved . There is also freedom of speech in our country . Nowadays , one can express his ideas with no fear , which is a great change compared to the past .

Those ideas of unity and reconciliation are more like ... sincerely , reconciling with some one who killed your people , is next to imposible ; where would one gain that spirit in order to reconcile ? I wonder what would have happened , for such people to reconcile . I can n't even imagine the beginning of all the act of reconciliation . A person can reconciliate with one whom they talk . Let 's say ; one can tell the other that , "@ please I am sorry ! I insulted you . Forgive me . @" But I can n't imagine someone who killed more than twenty people of your family members , standing infront someone asking him or her to reconcile . How possible would that be ? It is a problem maybe there is a way they are planning to do it , which I can n't imagine .

The RPF troops shot in the air . Then two helicopters from Habyarimana 's side went towards where the Inkotanyi were . A few minutes later we heard fire . There was a lot of noise due to the shootings . Then we said that Inkotanyi must have been there where shootings were taking place . We were about 24 people . So , we decided to go and join the Inkotanyi [ RPF ] . If it costs death , we shall die . But there was a young man from a place called Mwogo who knew the way . We were given machetes , bows and arrows .

My husband started shifting people ; he had a track , so he would shift people at night . At night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas . They begun from across there , that is where they would always attack . We had also planned to shift on Saturday ; we had got a house in Kabgayi for rent . Unfortunately , that was when the serious killings begun . Others had left ; it was a few families and us who had stayed .

Dad was also killed near home , he was at the stadium but he managed to escape and then went back in Ruvumbu , our home area and that 's where he was killed . But I found out about it when he had already been taken to Bisesero with other corpses . Some people exhumed his body from where he was buried after being killed and took him to Bisesero .

Later things cooled down . We heard that Nyamata people hid in the church . However some were killed on their way to the church but those who managed to escape and reach the church were protected . After sometime they all went back to their homes , most of them found their houses burnt . Some people had already been killed , those who went back home could help each other and construct huts [ Rwandan traditional houses , made out of sticks and grass ] . Generally in Bugesera we were always ready ; we knew we were being hunted and that at any particular time , we would all be killed . I had never seen Hutu in good terms with Tutsi . They were like leopards and ... or cats and rats all the time . That is how I could compare the two clans .

We had spent three days and three nights without eating . We walked up and came across a banana plantation , which belonged to Tutsi people who had fled their properties . The bananas were ripening and we were all grabbing them ; those who were tall could grab a banana from up high and those of us who we young like me would pick the ones that were falling . Others went to a cassava plantation . All that time there was no distraction , no one shouting , eh...It was unbelievable . That man had taken up the responsibility to be our leader ; he stopped us and asked us to continue our journey . We never walked in anarchy , we walked in a line . Then we reached near the main road but the same man who was like our leader told us to wait before we crossed . He advised us to hide in the banana plantation and let him go to spy the situation . He had a spear . He told us that , if we heard him scream we would know that he had been caught , which meant death . Therefore , we should run away . He went and reached the main road . He looked ahead of him and saw nothing . When he looked behind him , he saw a soldier wearing a cap . He was a tall man wearing a yellow T @-@ shir with Inkontanyi uniform trousers . He was wearing gumboots with a piece of cloth tied to his waist .

She told me how they never found out what exactly happened to her father but that he was taken by some Hutus secondary school students who told them how he was killed . She told me they threw them in a pit in Ruhengeri but I do n't know the exact location in Ruhengeri . Then came the multiparty system in 1990 . Things went wrong in our area . But I was n't there for long , I moved to Gisenyi where I lived with some of mother 's relatives . She is from Gisenyi . In Gisenyi , things were worse than in Kibuye . Maybe in Kibuye people acted as though everything was fine , but in Gisenyi , they were doing it in the open . They used to tell us that they 'd one day kill us . But I thought that was impossible . Mother had explained to me that my grandfather was killed because he was a Tutsi , saying he used to go the royal court but I did n't believe that was the reason he was killed . I felt like maybe there 's something else he did that made them kill him . I did n't believe that one could be killed just because they were Tutsi . But in 1990 , things were so bad in Gisenyi that I started seeing that it was true , the were killing the ‘ Abagogwes ' [ a Tutsi clan in the North of Rwanda ] ; so I could see where things were heading , I even realized that one day it would probably reach me or any other Tutsi .

Umva rero ... Gacaca ... ngirango abantu bavuze Gacaca ntabwo mbasuzugura sinabagaya . Ariko Gacaca kera njyewe uko nyizi , nari nzi Gacaca umuntu yoneshereje undi ; umuntu yarwanye n' undi ; noneho bakaregana . Mu nzego za Gacaca bakabunga muri Gacaca . Ubundi rero iyo Gacaca bavuga y' ubwicanyi , n' iki ... ntabwo nzi ... [ Arimyoza ] ... sinzi ukuntu nabivuga . Nabyo simbizi . Ese Gacaca ... ko bazanye Gacaca ngo barabafunguye ngo bemeye icyaha .

Sinzi ibyo ari byo . ||| Listen ... Gacaca ... people who voted for Gacaca , I neither dismiss them nor disrespect them . But how I used to understand Gacaca from the past experience is different from today 's Gacaca . Gacaca used to take place once someone had grazed his cattle on the fellow 's crops or if two people had faught together . Then they would report to gacaca courts where they would later reconcile the two . But I had never had of Gacaca for the killers ... [ She gulped ] . I do n't even have words to say about it . That so called Gacaca ... it came into existance in order to set those perpetrators free ; those who would admit that they killed ahundred people would be set free . I hear that in Gacaca perpetrators ask for forgiveness , or they will be asking for forgiveness . What about those who are already released ? Did they ask for forgiveness ? If yes , whom did they ask for forgiveness ? Umh ! Who did they ask for forgiveness ; Is it the government or is it the people whom they killed their loved ones ... ? what happened exactly ? That is the question we ask ourselves . From no where one hears that so and so was released , yet you had convicted him or her because you witnessed his or her deeds . Then one starts wondering ; "@ did they find him or her innocent for them to release him or her ... ? @" that is a big issue . No body knows how the government goes about it . But if we concinder our acient rwandan gacaca , there was no gacaca for killers before . It is beyond my imagination ... I can n't even understant it . "@ Gacaca for killers ! @" it is unbelievable !

I had given out my brother 's name and the organization Cocern in Gitarama told me they had a child called Shumbusho . I found very young children there . A one year old girl ran to me calling me ‘ mom ’ , she was called Mutoni . Maybe her mother and I looked alike , I do n't know what made her call me mom . The other children came to me , they thought she had found her mother . I explained to the ones who were old enough to understand that I was n't her mother . I carried her and headed towards the Management to find out if the child called Shumbusho was there . They asked me the names of the child 's parents . I told them father was called Matthias Kamuhanda and mother was called Yulida Nyiramatama . They went through the names of the children they knew and Shumbusho was a bright boy and he had given out those names , he was 7 . They told me he was alive but he had gone to school . It was a miracle and I felt like it was n't true even after they told me he was alive . I waited until noon when he came back from school . His school was n't far from the orphanage and he came at around 12 . When Shumbusho saw me , he became ... he was taken by surprise , he just stared at me , he did n't even come forward to say hi . I approached him and he looked so scared .

They used to have some skirmishes with my father in the past ; it was clear that they envied my father for having a big land . But they were forgetting that my dad was n't born alone ; though he then lived there on his own , he had brothers who had fled . They would come and take part of our land without permission ; like the family I told you who were almost like our relatives , they had taken a portion of our land ! Several others had built on our land ; behind our home there was a family on our land , on both sides of our home there was another family , still on our land . Someone would just come and build on our land but there was nothing we could do because the government was not fair to the Tutsis . Therefore , we would just live together but it did n't mean that we were happy with each other .

Then I started wondering if maybe the people who used hide in that house saw the Interahamwe entering the house . In fact , when the Inkotanyi troops came , they first passed into the swamp and told them to cross over to Nyamata . That was the reason why they never came back to those houses . They immediately went where they were told to go . As they were living , they told the Inkotanyi that they were some of their people who are terribly injured but still alive . They told them we were hiding in those houses . Then the Inkotanyi said , "@ No , that is none of your business , it 's our work .

AVEGA rero ni ni nk' uburyo bwo kusha kunshakira unyitaho mu gihe nari I Cyangugu nanjye ntabwo nari nyizi . ||| I do n't know how they found out that I was there but after visiting me , they started to look for AVEGA ... they were the ones to know about AVEGA . They said that they would contact AVEGA and let them know about my status and also so they follow me up . After some time they took me to Kigali to be admitted to the tribunal ... no rather to king Faycal hospital ! That 's how AVEGA started taking care of me .
Kayibanda uretse no kuba umukristu yari n' Umufratiri ye , yagiye yi yaragiye no ku yageze hafi yo kuba Padiri . Ubwo rero nabo wabashyira mu mu bantu bana ba Kiliziya bakosheje .

Eh urumva rero mu gipande cya cy' abaraique barimo n' abapadiri rero barimo . ||| Kayibanda , besides being a Christian , he was a brother , he was close to being a priest . So you can also include him amongst those members who wronged the church . Habyarimana was also a seminerian and he also had sisters who were nuns . His father was a catechist , he was from Uganda in Bufumbira and he come with priests from Rwaza , they even came to inaugurate the diocese of Rambura and then he joined the seminary . So if we said that the church wronged , Jesus would be inclusive . I just wanted to say that some members of the church are bad , indeed they did some things that brought divisions and they even got to a point of planning the Genocide . So in the group of ... Even priests are included .

Ni nkabyo nasobanuraga mu kanya , ariko ikintu cya mbere ni ukwigisha abantu . Ni ukubasobanurira ikibi kiri mu kugira nabi . Kuko kugira nabi bigira ingaruka buri gihe kuri buri muntu . Ndahamya ko abantu babikoze igihe birukankaka ibirometero ubundi umuntu atagenda , bapfira mu nzira , bicwa n' indwara , bicwa n' amasasu , bicwa n' umunaniro . Bagenda mu ishyamba kugenda ibirometero n' ibirometero n' ibirometero bagasiga ingo zabo ni ikintu kibabaje nabo kuri bo . Kitari kubaho iyo batabikora . Kugirango rero u Rwanda ubwarwo rwirinde kuzagwa muri icyo kintu...muri ibyo byago indi nshuro , icya mbere gikuru ni ukwigisha abantu . Ngewe nishimira ibyo leta ikora , byo kujyana abantu mu ngando , kubigisha kubabwira no kubereka ingaruka zabyo kuko ntawe...ntawe zigwa neza . Ni...ni ikintu gikuru cyo kwigisha . Kandi mpamya ko bizatwara igihe kinini , kuko mu Rwanda batangiye kwigisha ibintu by' amoko muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ... mirongwitanu ... guhera icyo gihe cyose hashira imyaka igeze kuri mirongo itatu . Géneration [ ababyirutse ] yose ije , yumva icyo yumva icyo . None rero bizashaka...sinzi niba bizatwara igihe kingana gutyo na none , cyo kugirango géneration yindi ize nayo ... ize itumva ko ... umuhutu agomba kwanga umututsi , ko umututsi agomba kwanga umuhutu ... Igihe kizaba kirekire ... Ariko kugirango abanyarwanda bagere hano , aho bicanye muri Jenoside . Barabyigishijwe imyaka myinshi .

Byari ... icyo gihe cyabaye kwigisha igihe kininii ... N' ibindi rero , mu Rwanda nabo icyo bakwiye gukora nk' uko babitangiye ni ukwigisha . Kwigisha...kwigisha ... Kandi mpamya ko inyigisho zitanzwe neza , exemple [ ingero ] zibaye nziza , ibyitegererezo bibaye byiza , muri génération [ urubyaro ] yakurikiraho mpamya ko byashira . N' ubwo abantu bajya bibuka , ariko twajya tubyitirira ko ari imyigishirize mibi , politique mbi , byazashira buhoro buhoro . Birakomeye ko mu bantu b' ubu géneration [ urungano ] yanjye mvuge...byashira , yabyemera ariko wenda ka kantu kakirimo . ||| That 's what I was just talking about . The first thing is through educating people , to explain to people the badness that lies in doing wrong . Doing the wrong thing always has consequences on anyone . I believe the people who did it also suffered while they were fleeing their homes , walking kilometres with their families , dying of hunger and of sickness . It would never have happened if they did not do what they did . For Rwanda to avoid falling into the same problem again , the first thing is to teach people . I am happy about the work of today 's government , taking people in training camps and showing them all the consequences . Education is very important and I guess it will take a long time just like division was first taught in Rwanda in 1959 . And for thirty years each generation was taught hatred . It will take the same amount of time for the next generations to be taught that Hutu do not have to hate the Tutsi or vice @-@ versa . It will take long but the important thing to know is that for Rwandans to get to the point of committing genocide , it took very many years . It is something we were taught in school . I was once a teacher and it is something that was given in the school programme . And I myself had to say it even though I did not believe in it . There was a lot of propaganda . I believe Rwanda needs to do a lot of teaching as it has already started it . I do believe that if the teaching is well done , and if the example and the focus are good , the result will be very good in the next generations . Maybe people will still remember but we will always know how the policy and the teaching were wrong . It will end slowly . Perhaps it would be very hard for the people of my generation to forget ... well one could pretend that he or she could , but there would still be something .
Buhoro buhoro bica abantu bikamenyera muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu niho abantu bihaye Imana bahunze muburyo bugaragara nka seminari ya nyundo barayirukana yose irahunga nibwo bwa mbere cyaraziraga ababikira bahunga barirukana nibwo bwambere batema batinyuka gutema mu ngo hari abafurere biciwe I kabwayi kayibanda na musenyeri perode bari mu iseminari ntoya ehh urumva nibintu bigiye biza buhoro buhoro bimenyerwa icyo watinyaga ukagitinyukaa yee buhoro buhoro bigera noneho rero niyo umaze gukora ikintu kibi rero niyo umaze gukora ikintu kiba uti wa mugani ....... Bigize atya . ||| Little by little they killed people and got stronger in 1973 , that 's when people gave it all up to god and evidently fled like the seminary of Nyundo that was all chased and had to flee , it was the first time , and was forbidden , the nuns fled , they were chased and for the first time they butchered people . They dared to butcher people in their homes . There are priests who were killed in Kabwayi . Kayibanda and bishop Peraudain were in the junior seminary , you understand that these are things that were coming little by little and people were getting used to it , whatever someone was terrified of finds that it is no longer terrifying . Slowly it reached a point where by even after doing something horrible , one says that is what they always say .....

Some were thrown in while still alive . Others after being cut down with machetes . No one could escape them ! Then they mixed up their bodies to the bones of cows since there were many cows here . This had actually become their home , they ate cow meat...people were bringing to them those who were meant to be killed . Very few were killed by bullet , they used to say they did n't want to waste their munitions . They were chasing people with dogs all around them . The consequence is that we still have so many victims ' bones to bury in respect . It will n't even be possible because this place is very wide ! For example , we were shown this place only very recently by pastors who work at the Rubirizi diary . They have been here for 10 years and we only found them recently ! We shall then request the Government that these people are buried in honor .

They tried fighting back to see if really would n't work out the first time they started . When Kayibanda had just started they got them out and made them shift .... He started by trying to make an area for the Tutsi only .... And Hutu , he did n't know that it would be possible to kill them and it 's true it would n't be possible if Logist had n't come and white man had n't stood up because they knew that it was possible . They went on planning it slowly by slowly and even the people who thought it was horrible started doing it , actually that 's what happens ; what someone was terrified of goes on finding it normal and one could think that maybe when you do it you will be struck by thunder and when you do it nothing happens .

I felt like the war would never end . Therefore , I had to join the army and get trained and maybe own a gun so that in case I was attacked , I would be able to fight back and then go and save others who were still being killed . I had left them behind . Secondly , I wished to be a hero . I wanted to save those who were still being killed , well I had left them behind but I wished to go back and save them . Thirdly , I joined the army because the life I was leading in the refugee camp was horrible . Therefore , I decided to join hoping to find a slightly better life .

At least he says you are useless , let 's not say anything more . This is where I can say the role of the catholic church was and it was something which was openly rebuked .

Then we reached the side of the swamp where we found a small pond and in that pond there was a piece of calabash [ in the Rwandan culture , it is used for drinking water . ] We were so lucky to find it there . We gave her some water to drink and poured some in her head , but you could clearly tell that she would not survive . Yet we were also fighting to save our own lives . There was no way we could keep on moving with her in such condition . We therefore told her to make an effort and crawl up the hill , so that she does not die in the swamp , and it was the time to go and look for sweet potatoes . She asked us if she could go to Nyamata hospital but we told her that it was more dangerous . She thanked us and prayed for God to bless us . We left her lying there . But I am sure she died because she was in a very bad state .

Every time , after cooking , they would ask me to carry the pot so that we continue our journey . We would walk and after some distance , they 'd ask me to go fetch water . I remember I walked up to Rusatira , those ends of Butare . I realised that I was n't going to cope with the situation for long because I joined their family when they used to eat maize paste everyday . It is made out of maize flour mingled in water . That is the only food that could satisfy the family . I was put in charge of grinding maize and separating the fine flour from the big particles . Therefore , I would grind the maize until my hands got swollen . However , that never stopped me from carrying the pot whenever it was time to move ahead . It was my daily job .

But they assured us how they would hide us and our properties ... they later said , "@ We must kill you ! @" But even before , one could tell from the look on their faces that they were capable of killing us but we had no alternative and nowhere to flee to . However , they had n't been able to kill us because of the custom I told you . [ My father exchanging cows with them . ] Their sons who were young and strong supported and encouraged them to kill us .

It 's maybe understandable that my parents were killed because they were Tutsis and they were even maybe contributing in helping out the Inkotanyis , they were adults and responsible for the actions but my sisters were just kids ! But what about young children were just screaming ? I can still recall the way the last @-@ born was crying . They carried her and told her that my mother had gone for a meeting and that that was where they were taking . My mother used to go for meetings and she would bring for them biscuits or anything else they wanted and so they told her that that 's where my mom had gone . What I am saying is that what hurts the most is the way children were murdered in the genocide . They did n't even know the meaning of "@ Inkotanyi @" and they acussed them of being "@ Inkotanyi . @" They did n't know what the word "@ Inyenzi @" meant . They did n't know whether they were Hutu or Tutsi . Sometimes I do n't understand it ! Those people must have been extremely cruel to do such a thing ! Killing an innocent child , who does not belong to any political party , who knows nothing ! That is the only thing ... that comes back to me . I was never cry when memories of the genocide come back to me ... the image of the death of our kids .. whenever I recall it , I feel so much pain .

She told me , "@ You should love people and always think of living with people peacefully . @" Then I wondered why she told me that but later on ; when she was no longer there , I thought about it again and I realized how important it is . I always think about it and try my best to live in good terms with everybody . Even when somebody hurts me , I try not to focus on that , as it is something that has to be there . I try to love people and to understand people and what kind of challenges they face in life . It is something I try my best to be able to put into practice .

I would see Seseko ... that lady who was called Seseko was the common figure , maybe it was because she was the one I knew before . I also knew Dushimimana , they passed by ... night would fall . I would sit and watch . They came up with a new system of hunting people with dogs , after realizing that people no longer live in the house . They would send dogs in the sorghum . Truly , most people survived from the sorghum plantation . Lets say one would walk a bit trying to change a position or when one is tired of either sitting or sleeping . Then we would separate the sorghum plants slowly and we would move without shaking . Because it was in the valley , they would stand on top of the hill and see shaking sorghum plants . Immediately they would send dogs and blow whistles . And , maybe it would show signs of raining . Whenever it would rain . I would fell relieved , because I used to know that no one would hunt me from the sorghum plantation , while it was raining . Maybe they will go to homes but no one can allow to be beaten by rain just looking for me . Suddenly , I heard ... I was trying to shift from where I was , because it was very close to the road yet groups of attackers were still coming from the stadium . Therefore I decided to extend upwards because I was afraid of dying while I was watching . I said to myself , "@ I better expend a bit and in case they run after me , they will find when I already fainted . @" So I changed the place and went a bit up . Suddenly , I heard whistles . "@ There is somebody there . Check in all sides in the middle of the plantation . The plants are moving , there must be people . @"

She was surprised to see me and although she saw how I had changed , she was happy that at least I was still alive . She asked me if there could be anybody else who survived and I told her that there was none . The time the Inkotanyi saved us . One of the soldiers said , "@ The Hutu do not really have any sham ; how could they dare hack a halfcaste person ! @" He said that after seeing how I was looking like ; my hair was overgrown . He could n't believe how they dare such crime . So I lived with my aunt who had a daughter . Her grandson who is a soldier later on came with his wife and we all stayed together . Then I went to live in Kacyiru together with my cousin 's spouse ; we met by chance and she told me that she did not know anyone in the family had survived and she could not continue to live alone . She asked me to go and live with her . At that time , people used to make decision at the spur of the moment . We went together but she got sick and died after some time . I then went back to Kimihurura to live with my aunt ; we later on shifted in the neighbourhood of ‘ Chez Lando ’ restaurant where she owned her own house . After sometime she also died and life went on ... I went to AVEGA and asked them for a house to live in , and I was lucky they gave me one . There were some children who were my relatives I brought in and we continued to live together up to now , that is how I am living .

I suggested that because I knew there was a sorghum plantation and that was where I used to live in peace . Therefore , I wanted to be living there and go back to her place to eat , that is if she wanted to give food to me . But when I live in the plantation in peace . She agreed and said , "@ truly they can kill you from there ... @" in her minds she thought we would always live together and I would keep working for her in her home . So , she accepted . I would take a Jeri can and whenever I would see people looking at me so much , I would look into the water . I would do that depending on the type of people who would be staring at me . For example , people who would come talking to each other in a funny way . "@ thy are going to kill me . @" I would think . But I would feel like ... I had started understanding that I must n't die . I had realized that death was not the solution . It was due to the fact that there were no more people dying . In that place there were not many people dying , maybe they had finished them . Therefore , I would sit and after they would pass I would sit and go through my past life ; how things happened , how people died and think about the future ; "@ what will the future be like ? @"

I do n't even think that there was anyone who survived . In case there is one , it would have been through God 's mercy . I remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking Ntarama . I accused Sehene Siriveste , Sindikubwabo Gilbert , Karangwa Charles , they all admit that they killed . Plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something . But I accused so many people and that shows that I was not alone . And I realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing I can do to pay the fine of what I did . During the war I was not being hunted . So , I was free as a Rwandan . Therefore , I witnessed whatever happened and I feel that I should say the truth about what happened . Because the majority of Rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . And survivors do not know everything because they were hunted . Others are Rwandans who came from exile . They were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . The only alternative is us who were free by then . And fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector .

I can give you a personal example ; If I had never joined the army , I would n't have become who I am today . I would n't have been able to leave with the Hutu . But after I joined the army , I came to know the truth ... Ok [ let 's leave this subject ] . I see the way they postpone things and if there is no immediate justice in Rwanda , if there is no truth , if there is no trial proceeding , and if there is no clear punishment , which is an important foundation then I can assure that there will be no unity . Nowadays they prioritised Hutus and Interahamwe ; it seems like they force the Interahamwe to admit their crimes . But how can one force someone to accept his or her crimes ? That is where things go wrong . Or how can one force someone to ask for forgiveness ? Because one admits his or her mistakes and later asks for forgiveness after realising that he or she really did wrong . But in our case , people are forced to ask for forgiveness yet in reality they [ perpetrators ] do n't even accept that they killed . That act may later on lead Rwanda into problems . Another thing is the perpetrators are the ones who are catered for . The survivors are not remembered , no one talks for them [ survivors ] . The government and GACACA court are biased . If the GACACA court does not work in transparency , they will not reconcile people .

A certain relative had sheltered us but we did n't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house . We came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there . We would consol on ourselves that , "@ after all they are our people , we can live in the house while they are still there .

There was a lady who lived in Nyamishaba , I did not know her name ; I tried to ask people about her name , gave her description but no one seemed to know her . She helped us a lot , she helped small children and my mother when she was sick , she gave us porridge with no sugar , she helped us in ways she could , she also gave us sweet potatoes to eat but we knew elsewhere we were heading for death

Instead they removed the king and put their oun king , Rudahigwa without following the Rwandan way of leadership . He was not a king who ruled , he was a worker like others headed by the administration , the name they gave him was ‘ Mwami ’ , and there was ‘ umwami ’ and ‘ mwami ’ . In fact as we were praying in the church we would say that let us pray for our king Leopord .

All I know is that it was a soldier and I do n't know who informed him about my family . I know a man who was my dad 's very good friend who betrayed them . My dad always used to go with him everywhere , in family functions like weddings or in traditional engagement ceremonies . They used to share a drink every evening . He was the head of Interahamwes in Kicukiro . He did n't help him at all , he betrayed him instead . We even used to hide in that man 's house when the insecurity would increase before the genocide . I remember a time my dad asked him if there was anything he could do , if he could maybe pay some money so they would not kill him . Another time , when he was wounded and sick after they shot him , my dad sent someone to ask him if there was anything he could do to help him and he still did n't do anything . In fact he 's the one who went ahead and told the others that he [ my dad ] was still alive . He told them to kill him and his wife and his children , as he would certainly revenge if he survived . So he sent the second group of people who came and killed him .

A while later , the Inkotanyi stood at the edge of the swamp and said to us @: ‘ It is safe , get out and come to us ' . The people we were with said okay lets get out it may be the Inkotanyi who came . They helped me because I was not able to move and the wounds in my head were not yet healed . Unfortunately the number of shrapnel was increasing , I tried to pick up some grasses and remove them but still I was not recovering . They took me on the back ; I could not recognize any of these people who were helping me . They took me at the hospital in Nyamata , I was treated for about two weeks . We were taken to Mingeti orphanage with other wounded children ; the ones that were terribly wounded were taken out of the country . My wounds were not that dangerous , I was treated in the orphanage .

She replied me that "@ Doudou is alive and I know where she lives . @" Therefore , we never reached at home where I lived , immediately I took her to Gihara where Doudou ( my sister ) was living .

I felt so ashamed and I 'd easily ask myself many questions . I remember my dad used to work in a place called Ririma , he was working at the Ririma prison . I lived in Ririma when I was young . Then in 1990 , 1991 and 1992 a rumor spread that Inkotanyi troops had invaded the country . I heard that in our home village [ Nyamata ] people 's houses were being burnt . The burning of houses used to be the first sign whenever there was a problem of tribes in this region . Then the same acts started in Ririma too . Normally in Bugesera , it seemed as though people were bewitched . Even when they heard that people were being killed ... I was lucky because I was living at the prison and the supervisors protected us . There were times when at the Ririma prison everybody was scared that the Inkotanyi troops were coming to take control of it . I remember that time we spent the night outside ; we could not sleep in our houses . Then the local people started killing each other ; we could hear that Hutu are killing Tutsi .

It is difficult to forgive and I have n't gone down that road yet because I do n't even know where to start . Who should I forgive anyway ? The former Government as it contributed to it very strongly ? Do I forgive people individually ? Do I start from forgiving ... ? I look around and I do n't know where to start from , as so many people were involved in it . It is certainly hard but it is possible . The reason I say it is possible is because patriots ... the survivors in this country are very few . And their strength is ... they can not develop the country on their own . Therefore , all people in the country should put their energy together and develop the country . Personally , I am not ready to begin that journey [ of forgiving ] soon . First I do not know who I should forgive . It is better those who committed the crimes start asking for forgiveness . They should come to us and we talk about it . Let 's say if it is a Hutu who killed , he should come and say , "@ I killed people and I am really sorry . @" They should do it in way one would really see that somebody is truly sorry . Then things would proceed and finally reach the countries that participated . And they [ those countries ] should use their power to help the survivors who are needy . I am not among them because I am not handicapped , I am able to work for myself . In fact I could compete in healthy competions ... I am very ready . But what about those orphans , those other kids who look after themselves with several other responsibilities , how do they survive ? The countries who participated in the genocide know about that . They should do something to show that although they participated , it was involuntarily ! They need to do something to show that they care about them [ the orphans ] despite everything that happened . I believe the process of forgiving is hard but possible .

And it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts .

Bwari bumaze gusa , bwari bumaze kwira ubwo , urumva , ibikorwa biba byabaye ku manywa ; bumaze kwira nibwo nanjye namanutse maze kubona ncitse abo babisha bari batangiye kwica uwo mwana w' umukobwa , ndetse ngeze hepfo gato aho bari bavuye nsanga intumbi y' umukobwa wambaye robe de nuit . Niba yari abyutse , niba yari yihishe nanjye nayobewe uko byagenze , ndetse bari bamwishe kare , yari yamaze gutumba . Nibwo nagiye manuka hepfo gatoya aho bita ku Gatare njya mu bihuru byaho , ndyama mu bihuru byaho , ndaryama , bigeze nko mu ma saa mbiri y' ijoro ndazamuka , kuko icyo gihe iyo byageraga mu ... ma saa mbiri y' ijoro , nahise numva ibintu birahosheje , nta rusaku rukibaho , nta rusaku rw' amasasu rukibaho . ||| Then night came . The crimes were taking place in broad daylight . When night fell I left after watching those people kill the girl . I came back and found a girl 's dead body in a nightdress . Maybe she had been awakened ; who knows . It seemed like she had been killed several hours before because by then her body had started to swell . Then I went to a nearby place called Gatare , where I hid in bushes around and took a deep sleep . I woke up at around eight in the evening ; at such an hour , there would be no noise , which implied that the situation has cooled down . At that time , there would be no noise of the shootings .
Ikintu mbona gikomeye nk' umuntu wacitse ku icumu ... kigora cy' umuntu wacitse ku icumu n' ukwibuka ibyakubayeho . Kuko iyo wibutse ibyakubayeho hari igihe bishobora gutuma ubuzima bwawe bupfa . Iyo ucitse ku icumu hari ibintu uba ufite wibuka bibi bishobora kuba byakubuza kugira ikindi kintu ukora . Bishobora no kuba byaguhindura mu mutima wawe , ukaba wahinduka umugome , kubera ibyo wahuye nabyo , cyangwa ibyo wabonye . gucika ku icumu ikintu ... ingaruka ... navuga nk' ingaruka mbi y' ikintu gituma ubuzima bukomera nk' uko nabivuze nk' ibyo wabonye , ibyo wahuye nabyo bishobora kuba byaguhindura , uko ureba abantu bikaba byatuma nta muntu wakunda . Kubera ko wahuye n' ubuzima bubi . Bikaba byatuma rwa rukundo wari ufite rushobora no guhungabana ku bantu . Kuko utinyuka ibintu byinshi . Ubona ibintu byinshi bibi . Nyuma yaho rero ubuzima bukagukomerera bugatuma nta kintu wageraho . ||| The thing that constitutes a challenge in being a survivor is remembering what happened to you . Sometimes as a survivor you can remember so many bad things that it destroys your life , it stops you from doing anything . You can change to become a very wicked person because of the things you saw or the things you went through . Being a survivor can make life very hard as I said because of what you saw . What you saw might change the way you look at people and it can even stop you from loving anyone . Your love for people can be completely destroyed . You get to see so much evil that you do not fear anything anymore . Even afterwards , life becomes so challenging that you can not achieve anything in life .

Ubwo rero hagati aho ntabwo bagombaga ... byari bitarakomera cyane ku buryo bahamenera , bagahera izo za Mayange za Musenyi , kuko niho hari abahutu benshi , b' abimukira n' abamere gutyo . Nuko , cyokoze iby' amahirwe wenda...bikagarukira i Nyamata ntibigere iwacu . Ariko tukabyumva , abaho bagahunga , bagahungira aho hakurya iwacu .

Instead , they started from the side of Mayange and Musenyi . Areas that had many Hutus ‘ Abamere ’ residing there . Some of the Hutus living there were locals and some had there . We were lucky they would just stop in Nyamata and did not reach our village . But we were well informed on what was going on and the people in the attacked areas would flee from their homes to our home village . Life went though it was so tough , we always used to hear rumours of Hutu burning Tutsi properties .

Ikintu cyo muri Jenoside kidashobora kumvamo , ikintu cyambere nibuka ni ngomwa ugomba kumenya ko ababyeyi bawe bapfuye . Icyo kintu ntigishobora kumvamo . Kwibuka ukuntu abantu bishwe , ukuntu bicwaga nabi kandi bari abana beza , ari abakobwa beza cyangwa ababyeyi beza . Ibyo bintu byo muri Jenoside , kubona imirambo cyangwa kugenda usimbuka imirambo . Kuba washaka kuryama nturyame ahubwo washaka nk' ikoti ukaryambura umuntu wapfuye wowe ukarifata , n' ibintu bidashobora kumvamo . Sinshobora kujya kuryama ntatekereje ukuntu mu rugo bapfuye , cyangwa se ntatekereje ukuntu abana bapfuye . Cyangwa se abantu bapfuye naba nari nzi n' ukuntu bapfuye n' ibintu bidashobora kumvamo na rimwe . ||| The thing about the genocide that I can never forget is first of all the fact that my parents were killed . The ways in which people were killed , and yet they were innocent children , innocent women , innocent parents , is also something I can never forget . Jumping over dead bodies , not being able to sleep , having to steal a jacket from the dead all these are things I can never forget . I can never forget . I can not go to bed without thinking about them and remembering how they were killed , or without thinking about other children who died or other people I knew . It is not something that I can ever forget .
Byumwihariko noneho binakabije kuko uyu munsi haracyari ubwicanyi ; ||| In addition the killings are still carried on towards the survivor of the 1994 killings .
Bayibonye bavuga yuko ariyo tureberamo inkotanyi baba babonye urwitwazo hari gurude za mazi abana bajyanagamo amazi nubwo hari hafi ariko hari ubwo batwaragamo amazi . ||| When they saw it they said that we use it to look at the Inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . There were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them .
Ikintu numva ki...navuga nibuka cyane kibi cyaba cyarabaye , ibyabaye byose ni bibi muri rusange . Kuko batwiciye abavandimwe , batwicira ababyeyi . Ariko ikintu kibi cyane nabonye ni uko ababyeyi bacu , bishwe n' abantu babazi . Bakicwa abantu babanye , abantu bagaburiye , abantu bavuje , abantu batunze mu nzu , akaba aribo baza mu bitero kubica , kandi bakabica urupfu rubi . Numva ari cyo kintu cyonyine numva kibi kibabaje kurusha ibindi . Urupfu rwo wumva ko ushobora gupfa , ariko kumva ko umuntu yishwe n' abava...n' abantu yatekerezaga ko bidashoboka ko bamwica , yarababaniye neza bose wumvaga bamuvuga neza , ariko ibintu byahinduka ukabona baraje . Numva ko aricyo kintu gisa nk' aho nibuka cyane nkumva kibabaje . Ni urupfu bapfuye . ||| The worst thing I remember happening ... in general all that happened was very bad . Because , our relatives were killed , our parents were killed . But the worst thing I saw was how our parents were killed by people who knew them , by their own neighbours ; people who used to come and eat home , people who were once taken to hospital by our parents , people who once lived at home were the same people who came in the attack to kill them . And killed them with a painful death .. that is the thing that hurts me the most . Death is a common thing , but being killed by people he never thought would ever kill him ! He was good to them and everyone used to say so , but when things changed they all came to kill him . That is the thing I remember most and that hurts me so much @: the death my parents died .

Nta n' icya kane , cya mbere y' intambara . ||| Before the war , we were five children and I was the last @-@ born . We never used to have problems at home because both mum and dad were working . For sure , we never had any problems . Sometimes there would be problems out there but it would n't mean anything to us because there used to be people to look after us . But after the war ... my sister and I ... yet we were the youngest ; all our elders were gone . Even though the war stopped , not any family member was left . Maybe we could be telling them about our problems . Those who survived only are those who can neither support themselves . Therefore , if we compare this life with life before the war , there is a very big difference . Because nowadays I may be having a problem but I can n't find anyone to tell it about . For example , I can spend two days without eating , yet before the war , I had never spent even a single day or an hour...every time I would feel like eating , I would eat . But now I can even spend three days and remain silent . Because there is no one I can share my problem with . Life after the war is very complicated . Mathematically , I would say it is not even a quarter of the life I was leading before the war .

After I verified that they had entered their homes , I found my way . In fact , I did n't have anywhere to go , I was just wandering around . That is why I followed them .

Amashyaka nabwo icyo gihe ... iryo shyaka naryo ryari rimeze nka Parmehutu uko yari imeze mbere . ||| During Habyarimana 's party @-@ struggles ... ? There was CDR , MRND there was also another party , which was suppressed or discriminated against , because they considered it to be a Tutsi 's party . This party was called PL . But the strongest and powerful parties in the country were CDR and MRND . We were oppressed and tortured very much . After Bucyana death , we were attacked and my husband was beaten . They left knowing that he was died . They robbed us ... by then we were living over there , near Kabuga 's building . But we were thrown out of our house and we started sleeping around like we did have where we belonged . That was the beging of those tortures ; just from those parties . For example whenever CDR would strike , people would be beaten ... I am telling you , people would die . They used to have grenades . Therefore , they would throw grenades to places like shops where several Tutsis would attend or drink beers . For example there was a certain man , who lived in Muhima and owned a boutique . Therefore , people were obliged to drink from Kamanda 's boutique because if they went to CDR 's bars they would not get out still alive . Even if it were women like us , we would be so careful to buy something like sugar from there . Because if you accidentaly stepped on somebody you would be beaten . Even Kamanda was one of the people who were being menaced . Infact he was killed just of recent . He was a young man not very mature ; he was n't even married . Generally they menaced people ... there is no single day when they stopped menacing people ; it is a long story . Therefore , Kamanda 's shop was crached with a grunade by the CDR members . Whenever they would strike , they would kill people ; they would burn places with grunades . Never the less they would ambush people on roads . They would stub people with bayonets . CDR was Habyarimana 's political party , it was simillar to PARMEHUTU of the past .

They even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed . But I did n't hide near there , I continued fleeing . It was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing . I looked for a way of going to E.T.O [ a technical school in Kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because I had no one to help me [ get there ] .

I stopped my job and went on to look after her , she was hospitalized for almost six months but she did not recover , and then she was transferred out of the country . So I stayed at home with the children and their father . One month later , the father decided to send the children outside the country and we , I and the father , will follow them later because it was not easy to get air tickets for all of us . He sent them in Belgium to meet their mother because that is the place where she the mother was hospitalized . I stayed with the father of the children . After a while , I proposed him to let me go back to school , as I was doing nothing and I had no job . The good thing I finished high school with good marks . When I wanted to go to FARG and apply for a scholarship , he said to me @: ‘ No , wait a bit I am still searching for your papers in order for you to study out of the country . @" I said to him @: ‘ while we are waiting for those papers , why will n't I go to school If everything is finished I will quit the school but in the meantime I am doing nothing . @" He said to me @: ‘ No you are going to study in the country side and I can not make it without you here . @" So I stopped .

Those then became tribes , and it run in ones blood , let me say . So what was just an activity became a tribe , that is how it came about , then the leadership became like that . They became our leaders and that is when things changed , they gave power to some yet in the past we all used to share power , it is written and I can show you the book right now .

They came and did all they did ... there are some things they did not manage to take that particular night . They came the following morning . When they came back that following morning , I had left .

Noneho nyuma ya Repubulika ya Kayibanda hari ukuntu byanacecetse ubona ko rwose Ububiligi busa nkaho nta kintu bwakoze mu Rwanda ahubwo noneho Habyarimana azana ubutegetsi nabwo burimo ibintu by' amayobera n' ubugome bwinshi ariko abanye n' Abafaransa ari nabo baje kugira uruhare mu mu myiteguro ya Génocide muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 94 ) . Kuburyo n' uyu munsi ubona ikintu cy' ubufaransa aricyo cyahawe ubugome bwabo cyangwa se no gufatanya n' abantu gutegura Génocide nibyo byahawe intebe cyane kurusha Ababiligi kandi aribo bazanye ikintu navuga ko aribo bazanye biriya bintu . Ibyo nta kintu wabitubwiraho . ||| Then after the republic of Kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the Belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in Rwanda and then Habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the French who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 . In a way , up to today you see how the French were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the Belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all . Is there anything you can say about that ?

Bose rero bagahamya ko abanya uwanditse iki gitabo wese akavuga ngo u Rwanda rurimo amoko atatu niko batangira bandika bose bihinduka ihame . ||| That it the Hamites who made it up , and the rest followed suit and they used that ideology to divide us into tribes , books that were written especially on Rwanda are many . Another was one written by Rochanoine de l' Axge , you will hear about it , they might also used it as reference . Whoever wrote this book said that Rwanda has 3 tribes that 's how they started .

It was the youth that got very involved . For us , I can say we were neutral because you could n't join MDR and you could n't also show , which political party you supported . We would just keep silent but the rest were so involved . People would rise flags for their parties ; like MDR , PSD but especially MDR would be present . We would just pretend to be absent ; that is what I would call it .

I told those people that my scar would stay as y souvenir of the genocide , because I personally do n't find it easy to forget the genocide . Never . I want to appear in the history of Rwanda . I will never forget what happened to me and I will tell it to my grandchildren and my great grand children . Whoever will generate from my family will have to learn that genocide is very bad . I will expose what was in it [ genocide ] . The way I am now giving you this testimony .

You were condemned you will die they were condemned it 's already done just like the way Long time a king would condemn someone with his parent to be killed saying that they have been condemned to death with his relatives

He was a very quiet guy . He liked listening to the radio news , which used to make me predict that maybe in the future he would become a journalist or a politician . There 's nothing much I can say about him because he was not very talkative . But he loved to listen to others talking . There 's nothing more I can say . When I was leaving , I called him and told him to be the one to drive the car when they go to a place where they were planning to go with his mother . The last thing I told him was not to drive too fast and to be careful on the road . That 's all I can say .

Maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't . But they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood . After they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier . But since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... I think they should just acknoweldge what they did .

I was told they were local leaders of Gikongoro . The Commandant had also come to give orders to policemen to shoot and to the rest of the villagers to throw stones and hack the ones who would survive the shootings . Some villagers left and local leaders said it was time to challenge the Tutsis . We threw stones at each other but we were defeated , they run after us up to the Murambi road , the main road that cars use to get here , and then I saw soldiers coming from the bushes where they were hiding . They threw grenades and shot . Even the soldiers we had come with started throwing grenades . Later they even had to refuel their supply . The villagers attacked the Tutsi who had sought refuge there . They hacked them with machetes and others were killed with clubs .

Some children were asking for forgiveness and even promised never to be Tutsis again in vain . I was so frightened I fell down ! Many people fell on me , Mélanie included . But Mélanie did n't ... About an hour later , when everyone was dead , I heard Mélanie 's voice calling @: "@ Odette ! Odette ! Are you still alive ? » I replied that I was still alive . She helped me remove the corpses that were on top of me . She had been very wounded by the bullets . She got me out of there and said @: "@ We do n't have anywhere else to go and it 's almost morning and when it 's daytime , they 'll find out that we 're still alive . @" She suggested that we go backt o Hélène 's . We went back to Hélène 's house and entered the kitchen and sat there , they did n't used to lock . Mélanie was bleeding very much throughout and she was so frightened that she was trembling . We stayed there until Hélène came in the morning to make some tea . She was surprised to find us still alive . She asked us about the rest of the people and we told her everyone else had been killed . She said if we remained there , we 'd still be killed anyway . She said we should stay there until she came back and she went to look for someone who would agree to hide us . We ate . Mélanie was very tired . Hélène did n't find anyone willing to hide us . She told us to make the effort to go and sit in some bush at the querry despite the fact the Mélanie was so weak , until she finds a better place where to hide us . In the evening , she took us there . As we were sitting there , Mélanie told me she was very tired .

We found the UNAMIR soldiers there . We went there at around 1p.m. When we got there , our houseboy went back home and when he got back , he told us our house had already been burnt . We continued living at ETO , many of the people from Kicukiro , the neighbourhood where we lived . People came to ETO hoping that they 'd survive . A few days later , on April 11th , 1994 is when the UNAMIR soldiers made an announcement from the UN saying that they needed to leave .

With those who help them and their agents . But its starting point then is cause even the others who help them are these political parties .

Then we saw a group of attackers who were coming from ... they coming saying that , "@ even those who had remained we have completed them . @" one would say , "@ I have killed the family of so and so .

When I reached there , I found that he had written most of the things , although he rewrote them again . Then he said that the court would call them , since most of them were not imprisoned . And one of them was a local leader who is not imprisoned up to now . They told me to come back that Wednesday at 9:00 a.m. I used a bicycle I had and while sloping down on my way back I was stoned by people I did n't know . Therefore , I decided to go back . When I looked back , I saw a group of people running after me . I went off the bicycle and started running , leaving it behind . Luckily I saw a vehicle and stopped it . I told them my story and then we went back , picked my bicycle , but the people who were chasing me were nowhere to be seen . Since then I never went back to follow up with the cases and in fact one of them was freed claiming that he is innocent because all who were accusing him were defeated in court . But personally I never went there and never even bothered to follow the proceedings . Most of the killers are still free in Butamwa and one of them is a local leader , up to now when I want to look for FARG documents I no longer go to Butamwa instead I go to Shyorongi because I also know the place very well .

What I am saying is that the catholic church and their leadership were not brave . Jesus would whip those who made the house of God unholy , in fact they killed people from churches and we simply kept quiet and run away .

I went to see my mother on the 5th no on the 6th . When I got there was n't a single living . Even the birds were silent . There were no mice around . In a word everything was silent and you could only see insects flying over the corpses . The other thing I recall is meeting a lady who used to be our neighbour ; she was wearing my mother 's clothes . I came back here to Kigali and when I got here I stayed with a certain family that had just come back from exile . Staying with people I did n't know , who were even sometimes speaking a foreign language , was also very hard . The other thing that was so difficult is that they did n't totally trust me . As a survivor I could have been with the Interahamwe because to them all the Tutsis had died . That was also very hard ; it was even harder than being a survivor because those you stayed with did not believe that you were a survivor .

There is no way one can kill your parents , kill you entire family and you remain like a tree [ indifferent ] , and then expect to talk to him or her nicely . Well you talk to him or her but your heart feels like a stone . The advice I would give the genocide survivors is ... they should n't always carry that burden . They should n't let themselves be stressed by the killers . Instead they should try and ignore those feelings and kind of renew their hearts , I mean they should have a heart of stone . They should try to ignore what happened to them . In fact they should try to talk to those who hurt them and listen to their opinion . I believe when someone hurts you and do not react with anger and you talk to them instead , the person will never be at peace , they will always fear you . That 's my advice .

Sometimes I feel like it is not true , as though they did n't die ... some days I feel like it 's impossible ... it 's impossible that so many people can die at the same time , as though they were maybe somewhere else but that they have n't died . But there 's nothing I can do about it , it is something I am starting to accept and I thank God that I have a good life today . I later on got married and I have 2 kids . Whenever I remember my siblings who died and even our neighbours , I feel very sad but when I look at my children , it gives me the desire to continue to live . They are my siblings and my children at the same time .
Noneho umugabo wanjye Pierrot niwe wateye urutoki aratinyuka arabaza ati ariko se njyewe ndashaka kubaza Aloys ko interahamwe ze arizo zifata abaturage zikabica zikabicira muri karitiye hano kandi babazi yuko ari abacu , bayobewe inkotanyi aho ziri ko ziri muri CND kuki mutazisangayo ngo muzice?ahubwo mu gatera nk' uyu mupfakazi Claudette akaba ariwe muza kubuza ... kuko ntibatumaga asinzira na gato buri gihe babaga bari iwe bamwatse amafaranga , bamwatse ibyo bashaka , ni nawe rero bahereyeho igihe cy' intambara .

Yet everyone knows that those people belong here ! Do you want tell us that you do n't know where the Inkotayi are living ? They are in CND . Why do n't you find them there and kill them ? In stead you attack this poor widow ‘ Claudette ’ and menace her . @" They could never let her sleep for a minute . Everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish . When the genocide begun , she was killed first in our area . And then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called Modeste ( I do n't remember his other name ) to go and face Aloys about that issue . However , we were very worried ; we knew that no body goes to Aloys ' home and comes out alive . We thought they would die .

If you are not too patient to live with them , is when people start saying you are a spoiled child . And after misbehaving , she or he may suffer the consequences such sicknesses .

Some people think that the genocide is over and there 's absolutely no problem . In fact it is now after ten years that some people are starting to realise the consequences of the genocide . Some people are getting to understand what genocide is . People are still hurting . When someone tells you that they have been unhappy for ten years , they mean it . Life ten years later is a tough one and this is still too soon , we still have a long way to go and despite the fact that those who did it do not want us to progress , we will try and move forward . And I believe God will help us to do so and to be able to help one another . The survivors do not live in good conditions , the orphans have a difficult life and they need other survivors to be able to share the challenges they go through and also the victories , the way out . I think us survivors need each other . Very few people who are not survivors can actually be able to help out a survivor . Whereas a survivor can encourage another one better , as he or she is the one who can relate to what they are going through and who can show them that is it actually possible to overcome . Sometimes hearing about the challenges other people go through makes you feel like yours are less important . It instils some strength in you ! That 's my opinion !

And even now when you tale a close look you realise that in that time there were two parts , the catholic church , the priests seemed to also be involved in those things together with those white men who came . I think you can explain that to us as well . Those white men who included the first missionaries , are they the ones who helped so as to achieve the goals the priest had of changing the beliefs of people and baptising them ?

Nk' abana noneho bazadukomokaho , bazabona archive kuko basoma ibitabo bavuge bati @: "@ byari bimeze gutya , ese kuki byari bimeze gutya . @" Bakabona amakasete , bakavuga bati @: "@ byari byaragenze gutya , ariko noneho ubungubu turabona ubuzima busa nk' aho bwabaye bwiza kurushaho . @" Noneho bavuga bati @: "@ difference [ itandukaniro ] byari muri zero ... none bigeze kuri +15 , cyangwa +20 gutyo . ||| Before I even talk about that , I 'd like to say that today 's Rwanda is very different from the way it used to be . Before , only one part of the Rwandan population could express themselves freely , while another one could n't . But today it seems more open to both sides as long as there are no divisional ideas into it . Before , there was so much division , people 's ethnic groups were written on Identity Cards but today it 's stopped . About the way I see Rwanda 's future , when I look at the things that used to be and that are no longer there , I believe things can only get better . Our children will go through the country 's archives and find out how things used to be and they will want to understand why things were that way . They will also see how things have improved and maybe say that then , things were on level 0 and will maybe be estimating them at +15 or +20 .
