One month later we went back to school and continued to live on but at that time it was the beginning of persecution , they sent to prison presumed accomplices and everything else even my father was part of those presumed accomplices that were sent to prison . Later he was released from Gako where he was jailed , at Gako ... rather Gashora . He came home after his release and life went on but people were still persecuted .

I did not go with my parents , we went alone ; at home we were nine children and I was a twin sister to one of the boys so we fled as we were . I and my brothers ran into a church in Ntarama . My father , my mother and my other two brothers fled in the same church we ran into .

They hit me with a shaped wood and a hammer and threw me on top of the dead bodies thinking that I was dead .

I spent three days and some people from Nyamata came , the survivors , among them there was a man called Bahena who lived in Nyamata , he rescued us with other men from Nyamata . They came searching for people who are still alive , they found me still breathing and saved me and other five children and laid us somewhere . They also rescued my brother and my eldest brother too ; he was still alright even though he was full of blood it is just that he was also covered by dead bodies . My brother introduced us , his sister and his young brother , to the people who saved him and said to them @: ‘ let me take her with me ; I want her to be with me wherever I will be ’ .

The Interahamwe attacked and found us inside , we started to run and there came a time we ran separate ways and I could not find my brother again , other people picked me up because I was terribly wounded in the head that I had shrapnel inside the wounds . They used some small sticks to remove Those shrapnel inside my head so that I can get healed .

When we met he said @: ‘ thank God I found back my sister and I would like to have her back with me . @" He took me again on his back and nothing happened to him , he had no wound . We continued to flee , whenever the Interahamwe would attack , we would flee to Gafunzo , nor go to Gasozi . Once the Interahamwe attacked and caught us surprising , normally they used to attack around 8 am But this time they came 6 am . We were used that whenever they came , they came shooting but this time they came without shooting so we could not hear them and we were even at the edge of the swamp , it was not easy to run into it . My brother managed to escape but it was difficult for him to flee me because I was terribly wounded the whole body so they caught me and others . They killed some of the people and made me sit down , they were watching me . When they finished to kill the ones inside the swamp and they took me with them , on our way going they saw a pot and told me to carry it , I asked them to let me search for some banana leaves so that I use them to carry but they forced me and put the pot on my head with all the wounds on it , they said @: ‘ carry this it is going to hurt you and kill you faster @"@ . I carried it and we continued till we reached the other church , they heard other people who were coming even shooting so one man among the Interahamwe who were with me started to shoot , and then they ran . They left me there and I hid myself in the bush till morning . In the morning around 4 00 am I went back to the other swamp and I could not find my brother . I spent three days without finding him , I found him on the third day .

We passed the first day the Interahamwe did not come and they came surprisingly on the second day , it is safe , "@ get out of where you are , it is safe @" said the radio . So we went out suddenly we were surrounded by the Interahamwe , They took my brother with other people and killed them after that they left them there . They knew my brother , they said to him @: 'we are going to kill you first and finish your sister after @"@ . They killed others first and came to him after , they hacked him ; they put him in front of everyone and hacked him while everyone was laughing at him . They left him there . They took the metal tank they had with them and went to fetch water in the swamp . They had a metal tank , a water tank and casseroles that they stole in several places . After fetching water , they searched for fire woods to cook with . They said to me @: ‘ think the way we are going to kill you brother , it is going to be awful for you ’ . They heated the water that was in The tank up to the boiling point , after boiling , his brother was still breathing a little bit so they carried him and put him in the boiling water and closed it . They tried to increase the heat after he was thrown in the tank . They took shaped woods and started to press his head saying his head is getting out but the truth was that he was tall and could not fit in it .

I sat there and they said to me @: ‘ you have seen how we killed him ’ . They even said we were about to cut him in pieces but his body is of useless state , nothing we can eat from it . They took him out of the tank and he was completely naked that his body started to become white . They left me there and said to me @: ‘ you ..... You are going to die right there , we do n't even have the strength to kill you , and we finished all of it in your brother ’ .

I stayed there , on the third day I regained my sense I woke up and found my brother still beside me but the smell was so awful and his body has grown bigger . I had a dress that I used to tie up my stomach so that I do n't feel hungry , the same dress he used while taking me on his back so I took it and covered him . I went back to the swamp in the CND , I found lots of dead bodies and I did not recognize any one of them because the people from our place fled in several places . They fled to Ntarama , nor to Nyabarongo .

After two days I felt like I am almost to die , even the water in the swamp was stinking . A while later , the Inkotanyi stood at the edge of the swamp and said to us @: ‘ It is safe , get out and come to us ' . The people we were with said okay lets get out it may be the Inkotanyi who came . They helped me because I was not able to move and the wounds in my head were not yet healed . Unfortunately the number of shrapnel was increasing , I tried to pick up some grasses and remove them but still I was not recovering . They took me on the back ; I could not recognize any of these people who were helping me . They took me at the hospital in Nyamata , I was treated for about two weeks . We were taken to Mingeti orphanage with other wounded children ; the ones that were terribly wounded were taken out of the country . My wounds were not that dangerous , I was treated in the orphanage .

I lived thereeeeeee . I was hospitalized till I recovered . Later on in 1996 , I got ill consequences due to the other wounds I had , I suffered for a terrible headache for a while . There came a time the blood started to flow out of the head . I was bleeding so much ; the blood was flowing out of the nose and ears . I lived with that illness for a period of nine months . In 1997 , I was hospitalized again and I got well . I started to live on ; I went to school to study . I lived in the orphanage , there were people who used to come and visit us . They brought to us different things among which clothes and other things , there were from an NGO called CICR . There came a man and said @: ‘ I would like to take the other kid who is always lonely , I want her to stay with my children ’ . It was me that he was talking about because I used to like staying in a quiet place due to the headache I suffered . It was safe for me when I am out of noise . Whenever he came , he could see me lonely . So they allowed him to go with me if he feels that he is able . He was told @: 'if you want a child in here , first come and introduce yourself and say how you will care about her and once the orphanage is satisfied , can let you go with the child ’ .

They told him @: ‘ what if you take her , and ruin her life it will be very bad plus she is a lame . @" So he promised that he will take good care of me . On the third day he came back , now this time he was allowed to go with me because he kept on insisting that he wants to go with me . On the third day , he had to fill up all the requirements and to sign . At Nyundo orphanage where I lived , they finally allowed me to go with him . I stated with that man , he had a wife and three children among which two boys and one girl . They were older than me . We lived together for a long time . I went to school , FARG was my sponsor and I went to study at Saint Andrew high school . I completed the ordinary level and went to Gisenyi . He really took care of me . He raised me as his child . I studied in Gisenyi till I completed high school , we lived in Remera . After I finished high school , I started to work at CHUK , and later on I stopped . I started to work with the wife of the man who adopted me ; she was involved in trading so we worked together . We worked together but she was suffering from leg cancer .

I stopped my job and went on to look after her , she was hospitalized for almost six months but she did not recover , and then she was transferred out of the country . So I stayed at home with the children and their father . One month later , the father decided to send the children outside the country and we , I and the father , will follow them later because it was not easy to get air tickets for all of us . He sent them in Belgium to meet their mother because that is the place where she the mother was hospitalized . I stayed with the father of the children . After a while , I proposed him to let me go back to school , as I was doing nothing and I had no job . The good thing I finished high school with good marks . When I wanted to go to FARG and apply for a scholarship , he said to me @: ‘ No , wait a bit I am still searching for your papers in order for you to study out of the country . @" I said to him @: ‘ while we are waiting for those papers , why will n't I go to school If everything is finished I will quit the school but in the meantime I am doing nothing . @" He said to me @: ‘ No you are going to study in the country side and I can not make it without you here . @" So I stopped .

He started to come home after job when he is nervous and talking rude to me . One day , he said to me @: ‘ Even thought I sent your brothers out of the country , there is something I would like to ask you . @" I said what is it , he said to me @: ‘ I would like you become my wife . @" I said to him @: 'it is impossible , you raised me as you child , and I am your child and that can not happen . @" He said to me @: ‘ you have to be my wife . @" I said no again . He said to me again @: ‘ If you can not then leave it . @" He said to me @: ‘ By the time we reach in another country , you are going to live on your own . @" I said fine . He continued to act strange . At home we had two housekeepers , a boy and a girl , I went somewhere and I returned back and found the girl was chased away . I asked him why ? and he said to me @: ‘ That is none of your business , it is between me and the house girl . @" After two days , on the third day he came home , I was alone and the house boy was not there . I was used to not sleep alone at home ; I always called a neighboring friend to sleep with me . He did not know that I sleep together with somebody else .

When he arrived at home , he knocked on the door and they opened for him . I was asleep in the room , so he went straight on the dining table to eat . When he finished eating , he went in his room . After few minutes , he called me and said to me @: ‘ Yvonne , come here I want to tell you . @" I went in his room and he said to me @: ‘ There is something I would like to tell you , return in your room I am coming . @" I return in my room , thinking It is nothing of importance because since 1997 ; he never called me for a serious issue . I went back to my room and he came after me , he realized I was sleeping with somebody else . He said to me @: ‘ Who Is this ? Who is that girl ? @" I said to him @: 'it 's the other neighboring friend . @" He said to me @: ‘ I do n't want you to bring somebody in this house when I am not aware of it . @" He wanted her out , I begged him saying It 's really late . I said to him @: ‘ please be patient until morning and she will go once and for all , I was just lonely . @"

When my friend realized that it was getting far she woke up . He said to her @: ‘ Wake up , I will escort you up to your gate . @" He escorted her up to where she lived and came back . When he came back , he went straight to his room . He did not stay longer in his room , he came back to mine but I have already closed and slept . So he tried to enter and found it was closed . He said to me @: ‘ Open . @" I refused to open and he said to me @: ‘ Open it 's my house I will break it , open . @" I opened straight away and he said me @: ‘ You know what , the other thing I told you and you refused saying It 's impossible , today it is going to be possible and you are going to be my wife . @" I said to myself @: ‘ I am going to scream . @" By the time I started to scream and everything , he took a pistol out of his pocket ; he was wearing a jean trouser . He said to me @: ‘ Whatever I force you to do , you have to do it otherwise I am going to shoot you and go to jail . @" From there I accepted whatever he asked me to do , I took off all my clothes and he raped me . When he finished raping me , he went back to his room to sleep and I remained in my room . He locked my room and he opened it while he was going for a shower in the morning , after he went to work . I woke up in a desperate mood feeling like a fool . I was asking myself what if he is HIV positive and that he just contaminated me , what if ....... I do n't know .

She said to me @: ‘ Let 's go and report him . @" We went to Remera police station because we lived nearby , closer to Rwahama 's building . We reported him and they sent him a letter asking him to come at the station . The madam asked me to not go back home , I stayed there the way I came . I came with nothing except the clothes I was wearing . When he came at the police station , he was directly sent to prison . I went to stay at the madam 's house . Four days later , I passed at the police station and I found out he was released . When I realized that he was sent free , I asked why ? And they said to me @: 'he escaped . @" I went to the madam 's house ; she lived near the prison in a short distance . But us , we lived closer to KIE near Rwahama 's building . I and this madam went to check if he might be at his house and we found he packed everything and shifted to another place .

I tried to calm myself and this mother helped me to calm myself . We stayed together and she said to me @: ‘ I will help you as I can , just be strong now that he left you and we can not find where he went . @" I wrote to his wife because I usually used to contact the children and their mother and I asked her about everything . I told her everything his husband did to me and she told @: ‘ I am sorry , but you should have reported him at the police . @" I said to her @: ‘ I reported and later on he escaped . @" I realized that the man did not go in the same country of his wife , but he went in different one . The wife was still in Belgium . Later his wife wrote to me and said that he was in Australia and he has contacted her . I stayed in that life , I stayed with that mother and she helped me as she could till I gave birth .

After two months , she left the country because she had a husband who was a student in Makerere University in Uganda . So she went to see her husband . I was left alone with the child and she said to me @: ‘ There is nothing I can do , I have to go and I can not take you with me because I do n't know where to take you . @" She said to me again @: ‘ You can not handle the life out there , so try your best to live . @" The only thing she left me was a mat to rest on . I stayed there ; I started to struggle with my child . I could stay in the house desperate ; I could spend the whole day and night without eating . The next day , if I meet a good person and he or she gives me food . Perhaps the following day I do n't find someone . My child could get ill , if it happens I get a job I take care of my child . Later I suffered the kind of headache I suffered in 1996 , I started bleeding in the nose but it was somehow different from before , though I was bleeding so much . I started to lose weight every single day ; day and night I was losing weight . I said to myself what if I am HIV positive and my tests came negative . I do n't believe I am alright . I went on with other tests in order to be aware of how I am doing physically , I found out I was alright . I continued to lose weight ; I lost weight every single day . I did not stop calming myself though I was like that . I had 85 kilograms before ; I lost almost 33 kilograms in that sorrowful life . Up to now , I live alone and I feel lonely . Whenever a day passes , I thank God the way I live with friends and good people who understand me and my life . I wonder how I am going to return to school . This is a problem I face up to this moment .
