That is what I was aware of . Habyarimana died later on died . I remember we had a councillor called Iyakaremye Emmanuel . He came at home and asked my dad in which politial party he was . My dad replied that his political party was in his heart and that it was n't necesary to tell it to him . A week later , some people from different neighbouring sectors came to our home sector . They had come to kill the Tutsis , and when they reached home , they took my dad away . They asked him to give them money . He had 30,000 FRW . Therefore , he gave it to them and came back home . Two days later , it was on a Sunday and we had gone to church . When we came back , they came home and called my dad . All of us were in the compound and they told dad that they were going to kill all of us . They took all the cows that were at home and ate them but they never killed us as they had said . After about a week , the war broke up into the whole district .
Ubwo baraje , bamaze kuza , icyo gihe hari mu gitondo , bakomanga ku rugi rwo ku irembo , ubwo abana twari turi mu rugo twahise dusimbuka urugo na Mama , ariko Papa we aguma mu rugo .

Ubwo hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , mama aravuga ati @: "@ noneho mureke tugende nanone tujye ahantu ku kiliziya abe ari mo tujya . @" ||| I remember they came home one morning . They knocked at the front door . My mother and all the kids who were at home skipped the fence and only dad remained there . There was a millet plantation behind home and we just hid there . We did not recognized any of the people who came home , we only managed to identify two of them . One was called Karamage and the other one was called Minani . They came and took dad to a certain center that was around . They made him sit there and beat him . I heard that they did not kill him on that day . We spent about two days in the millet plantation . Then they came back at home , but dad was still alive ; they had n't killed him yet . A day later ... we did n't know where dad was . In the millet plantation where we were , behind home ... we were with mum and the rest of my brothers and sisters . We were five children . The boys left us . I remained there with mum and my older sister . In the evening we went to a certain hill in our village and hid in a cave . And the following evening we left and mum took us to our nieghbours . When we reached there mum asked them to hide me as I was the last born . They told my mum that they were not allowed to keep Inyenzi . We immediately went back to hid in a millet plantation . After about two days ... mum suggested that we go to a church and hide there .
Tugeze ku kiliziya...icyo gihe twageze ku kiliziya nka saa yine . Tuhageze tujya mu kiliziya mo imbere tumaramo iminsi itatu , hashize iminsi itatu baraza badukuramo bagiye kutujyana mu ruzi . Hashize...ubwo turagenda tugeze ku gacenter , mama baramugumana , twebwe baratubwira ngo @: nitugende . Twanga gusiga Mama , jyewe na mukuru wanjye , baradukubita . Badukubise kubera ko twari abana , turemera Mama turamusiga turagenda . Tujya ahantu twari duturanye na none ku rugo , urwo rugo kubera ko bari inshuti z' iwacu , jyewe na Mukuru wanjye turagenda , tugeze inyuma yaho , ubwongubwo twihisha munsi y' urugo , tubona umukobwa wo muri urwo rugo n' umuhungu musaza we , turabahamagara tugirango wenda baratugirira impuhwe batujyane mu rugo baduhishe . ||| When we reached the church ... it was around 10 o'clock .. We entered in the church and spent about three days there . After three days they came to get us and led us towards the river . When we reached a certain center , we were stopped and they wanted to remain behind with mum and told us to go back . Both my sister and I refused to leave our mum behind . They started beating us and since we were young kids , we agreed and left mum there . We went to another neighbours ' house . Both our families were friends , so my sister and I decided to go there and when we reached , we hid behind their home . As we were still hiding , we saw one girl and one boy members of that family and we called them . We thought they would be merciful and hide us in their home .
Ubwo twarabahamagaye , bamaze kuza baratubwira , ngo @: "@ bene wacu babasize muri he ? @" Ubwo bahise badufata jyewe na mukuru wanjye , batujyana ku Nterahamwe yicaga abantu cyane yitwaga Byemayire , batugejejeyo ngo Byemayire atwice , dusanga Byemayire ntawe uhari . Baradukomezanyije batujyana ahantu ku 'gacentere' kari gahari , ngo wenda twahasanga izindi Nterahamwe gakushwa , kugirango wenda zibe zatwica . Turagenda tuhasanga abagabo babiri , bamaze kutubona , baratubwira bati @: "@ aba bana ntabwo twabica , papa wabo yari umuntu mwiza yatugiriraga neza , nimubareke bazagwe ahandi . @" Turamanuka...ariko wa muhungu bamwitaga Minani , na mushiki we bamwita Yansoneye , bo barakomeje baratujyana .

Uwo bitaga Minani yarantemye , antema ku kaguru , ngo nihute . ||| So we called them and when they came they asked us , "@ How did our people [ the Hutu ] leave you ? @" They immediately took us [ my sister and I ] to some Interahamwe called Byemayire , who was a terrible killer . They took us there so that Byemayire would kill us . Fortunately , Byemayire was n't around . They procceeded and took us to a nearby center , hoping to find there some other cruel Interahamwe so that they would kill us . When we reached there , two men were hesitant , "@ We can not kill these two kids ; their father was a very good man and he helped us out several times . Let them go and be killed elsewhere . @" Therefore , we left . But the boy called Minani and his sister Yansoneye followed us saying that they were going to show us to Interahamwe in order for them to kill us . When we reached a place called Musenyi , I failed to walk because I was very tired . Minani then hacked me on the leg and said that I sould hurry .
Bamaze kuntema ariko turagenda , ntabwo nahise ncika intege kugirango , wenda ku buryo ntabashije ubugenda , narakomeje ndagenda . Turagenda tumanuka umusozi jyewe na mukuru wanjye , tugeze haruguru ku musozi bahamagara abo hasi ku ruzi ngo @: "@ tubazaniye Inkotanyi , ngo @: nimwitegure . @" Barakomeza baratumanukana , batugejeje ku ruzi , bafata mukuru wanjye bamuhekesha igiti , bampekesha amabuye abiri , batujugunya mu ruzi . Ubwo mu ruzi twamazemo iminsi ibiri , tugiye kubona ... .... jyewe mvamo ngwa mu bisheke , mukuru wanjye agwa hakurya y' uruzi , ntabwo twagu ... ... ntabwo uruzi rwatujugunyiye ahantu hamwe .

Ubwo bumaze kwira nazamutse ahantu bita ku musozi wa Kagina , ndagenda ari ninjoro , nka saa saba z' ijoro . ||| Though I was hacked , I still we continued to walk ; I was n't too weak to stop walking . As we were slopping down the hill , still in my sister 's company , they called some people who were down at the river and told them that they had brought them some Inkotanyi , to get ready . Therefore , they continued to slop down with us and when we reached the river , my sister was forced to carry a tree trunk and they made me carry two stones , then they dumped us in the water . We spent two days in the water . We found ... I found myself in the sugar cane plants that were around and my sister came out from the other side of the river . The waters threw us in two different areas . That was after two days and I was in the sugar cane plants but I did n't know where my sister was . I had last seen her when they were trowing us into the waters . I remained in the sugar cane plantation naked ; I did n't ... I came out of water without any cloth . Some of our relatives were in Runda ; an old lady who was my mum 's aunt . But I did n't know the place very well . They dumped us in the river from a place called Iraro and we came out at a certain place called Kamuhada , at a brigde that is between Kigali and Gitarama . Then when night fell , I went to some hill called Kagina . It was in the middle of the night , at around 1 o'clock in the morning .
Ndagenda , ndakomeza ndazamuka ... ... ndazamuka , bujya nko gucya nka saa...nka saa kumi , urwo rugo nirwo na...niho nahageze .

Ndabasuhuza , Mama akimbona agahinda karamwica , arambaza ngo @: "@ mukuru wanjye ari he ? @" Mubwira yuko bagiye kuturoha mu ruzi twari kumwe , ariko we sinzi irengero rye . Ubwo turahaguma jye na Mama hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , ngiye kubona mbona mukuru wanjye nawe araje Turamubaza @: "@ ese wowe waje ute ? @" aramubwira ngo @: "@ avuye ahantu hakurya y' uruzi , ahantu bita i Nyagatovu . @" Ubwo turagumana uko turi batatu .

It was almost morning , at around 4 o'clock in the morning that is when I reached to that home . I went and knocked on their door . They had n't seen me in a long time . They opened for me and I found my mum already there . And when she saw me , she was filled with sorrow . Then she asked me , "@ Where is your older sister ? @" I told her that by the time they drowned us , we were together but I do n't know what happened to her later . Therefore , my mum and I stayed there and two days later , my older sister also came . My mum asked her how she came . She told her that she was coming from somewhere across the river , in a place called Nyagatovu . The three of us remained together . Actually , the man in that family was not being hunted . He was the one to hide us and his wife was an aunt to mum and she was also among the group of hunted people . Since her husband was a Hutu , he was not threatened . We all continued to hide there ; my mum , my older sister and I. Later ... it was in ... it was still in April in the middle of the war . Then in May , the man [ husband to her mum 's aunt ] said , "@ I do not want to be accused of being Inkotanyi . All of you go . @" He told his wife if she believed she had to continue hiding us , then she should leave with us .

We went to a certain place called Runda and then to a place called Gihinga . When we reached a certain roadblock , they stopped us . They asked mum to give them her identity card . But she did n't have one . Then they asked her ; "@ Whose kids are those ? @" she told them we were not her kids , that we were just walking together . They made her sit on a pit . We refused to leave her . We stayed there waiting for them to kill us , but they did n't . After sometime , a group of Interahamwe came . When they reached there , one of them said to the rest , "@ I know this old lady , she is not a Tutsi . @" That 's how we survived then and went on . I had a godmother in a certain place called Ruzege . Mum took me there , but when we got there , they said that they could not hide such a big number of people , that they would also be killed . But they allowed me to stay with them and asked mum and my sister to look for elsewhere to go . Therefore , they left and I stayed there . But we had other relatives in a place called Nyamiyaga in Musambira commune . When they reached there , they found they had all been killed . Mum immediately left for Kabgayi and my sister stayed there with other kids who were there and they hid together . After mum reached Kabgayi , we never got to know what happened to her ; I wonder if she died or if she 's still alive , but she most probably died . Since the war ended , we have never seen her . We do n't even know even know how she was killed ... neither where she died .

Two days later ... I think it was two days , my godmother came and told me , "@ I will not continue to hide you because they may kill me too . @" She went on to say , "@ You remember you came here with your sister and your mum and you know they left . It is better you follow them . @" I asked her how I was going to follow them yet I did n't know where they had passed . I told her I did not know which way to take . She told me it was none of her business . "@ Whether you die or survive it is your problem @"@ , she said . That is what she told me . In the morning ... I remember I was sick ; I had a terrible wound on the knee , I could n't walk properly . In the morning , it was even raining , I left alone and sat on the road wondering what I was going to do . Then I advised myself to go to that place where we first hid when the war had just started . It was in Runda . Therefore I went back there . HHHowever the man was very motivated into genocide issues . Fortunately , his sons were good people . So they interceded on my behalf , "@ This is a very young kid , they will never ask her for identification papers . So why worry ? Just keep her until the war is over . @" They went on to convice him , "@ The Interahamwe do n't know her , in case they come , she will tell them that she is your granddaughter . @"

The war went on and at some point they began shooting . The Inkotanyi came to Runda while I was there . During the time of shootings , we all fled together . I thought of staying in the house alone and thought it would be hard . We again crossed over to a certain place ... Runda was next to Taba and Taba was my home village . We passed there and went further . We reached a place called Kanyinya , where we found a roadblock . At the roadlock they would stop people and look into the palms of kids who were not yet able to get identity cards . When they looked into mine , they asked me , "@ Where do you come from ? @" I lied to them and gave them wrong names of my parents . Then they let me go . We continued our journey and reached Nyabikenke and Bulinga . We went through all those areas . When we reached Gisenyi , we turned back as it seemed like the war had calmed down .

Since I was alone , I went back to Ruda . The war had stopped then . I found when the old lady was still alive but the old man had died . We went to a camp in Ruyenzi and camped there . After some few days ... I thought that maybe someone from home may come to that camp , but no one came . I just stayed there with those people . In August 1994 ... I remember we had gone to church , when I came back , I found my sister there . It was like a big miracle to me . Before greeting her , I first asked her ; "@ Are you still alive ? @" She said , "@ I am alive . @" Then I asked her , "@ You did n't die ? or am I just talking to a ghost . @" She said , "@ No , it is me , I am still alive . @" "@ Where were you living ? @" I asked her . Then she told me that she ... she went to Musambira , where we had family members and continued to hide . Later she went to Zaire [ Congo ] and came back .

We neither know how people from home died nor where they died except dad who was killed at a certain center where they had taken him . That is where they killed him .

From August 1994 to January 1995 I continued to live there where I was when the war stopped . My sister and I continued to live there together . They somehow wanted to make us their slaves ... the war begun when I was in primary four . Then they stopped me from going back to school . Though my sister was n't so old , she was slightly wiser than me . Then she asked , "@ How shall we live this kind of life ? They can n't allow you to go to school ; neither did they allow me ... All they wanted us for was to collect grass for their cows , to dig , to fetch water , generally to do all the domestic work . That was what they expected from us and to them that was the reason why they were taking of us .

The Burgomaster of our home area was a genocide servivor too . Therefore , my sister went to him and told him what was going on . Then he asked her , "@ What can I do for you ? You are still young ; you can not live alone in a house . And even if you did , what would you survive on ? You have no one left in your family that could maybe protect you in your life . @" Then my sister told him , "@ Instead of continuing to live the way we are living , we 'd better live in a house alone . We do n't care if it means dying . @" By then there were Interahamwe 's houses , which were empty ; the Interahamwe had fled . He gave us a house . Then we started living in it . That was in 1995 , I went back to school but my sister was confused about what to do . We both went to school at the same time for as hort time . Later on in 1996 , the burgomaster got her a job as a taxe collector . So , when she started working , I was able to continue school . In year 1997 , I started secondary school and my sister continued working until the year 2000 . I was in secondary four when our mayor was changed . They brought another one who was not aware of our life conditions . They stopped all employees who did not have diplomas and my sister was among them . I was in secondary four when she left work . Fortunately , FARG was founded . Therefore they would pay for my school fees but as far as domestic needs were concerned , we got a lot of problems .
Ariko icyo gihe ntabwo twabaga mu mugi wa Kigali , twabaga i Gitarama ku isambu . Ibwo iyo sambu , kubera ko mukuru wanjye agikora , ntabwo sambu ntiyigeze yangirika , yashyiragamo abantu bakayikora , ibivuyemo bikadutunga . Akimara guhagarara ku kazi , ubwo ibintu byari biri mu isambu nyine byarakomeje biradutunga . Noneho hashize iminsi , ngo haza itegeko rivuga ko umuntu wese , azasubiza iby' abandi . Ya nzu bayidukuramo . Bamaze kuyidukuramo , ubuzima buradukomerana . Ubwongubwo niho twahise twumva isi ihagaze , ariko mukuru wanjye agerageza kwegera FARG [ ikigega ... ] . yegereye FARG , ubwo FARG yumva yuko ikibazo cyacu gikomeye , ikazajya iduha inkunga ya buri kwezi 20'000 frw @/@ mois [ ibihumbi makumyabiri ku kwezi ] . ||| We were not living in Kigali then . We were living in Gitarama at the farm . Our farm was well treated since my sister was working ; she would employ people to work on it and we would live on its harvest . At first when she had just left work , havests from the farm continued to feed us . After some time , there was a new policy that was put forward ; everyone had to give everything that did not belong to him or her . Therefore , we were asked to live the other house . When they took us out of that house , life became hard . It was as though life had stopped . But my sister tried to contact FARG and then FARG considered our problem . And they would give us 20,000 Frw per month .
Ubwongubwo muri 2001 , aribwo nyine twabonaga n' ayo mafranga ya FARG , mukuru wanjye nawe ... ubwo nari ngeze muri cinqui√®me s√©condaire . Abona ko [ mukuru wanjye ] ubuzima...ubuzima bwe nawe , bumaze ku , buzapondekara [ buzangirika ] , kubera ko nta kintu yari yigejejeho . Kubera ko we intambara yabaye yiga deuxi√®me s√©condaire [ umwaka wa kabiri w' amshuri yisumbuye ] . Ubwo aravuga ati @: "@ ugeze cinqui√®me s√©condaire [ mu wa gatanu wisumbuye ] , kandi urabona ko FARG iduprotega [ iturwanaho ] ikaduha ticket n' ibikoresho , none nanjye ngiye kureba uburyo najya kwiga . Ubwo nawe yahise ajya gushaka ishuri , nawe aragenda ariga . Ariga FARG [ ikigega ] irakomeza iradufasha , imaze kudufasha bigejeje muri 2002 , ubwo FARG [ ikigega ] iduha inzu mu midugudu y' abana bibana hariya Kimironko . Imaze kuduha inzu tuyijyamo , FARG iba d√©centralis√© [ yegerezwa abaturage ] , gufasha abantu iba irabihagaritse . Imaze kubihagarika , ubwo jyewe nari ndangije kwiga...imaze kubihagarika ubwo njyewe nari ndangije kwiga...mbere yo kugirango nyine ihagarike kudufasha , ubwo ngewe nari ndangije kwiga . Ejo bundi , mbona ikiraka muri Ibuka , ndagikora , ubwo kiradutunga , na mukuru wanjye nawe abona ibikoresho byo kugirango ajye ku ishuri . Ikiraka kirahagarara , kimaze guhagarara ubuzima nabwo burahagarara . ||| Then in the year 2001 , which is when we used to get the funding of FARG ... my sister too ... I was in secondary five . My sister realised that her life was also getting worse because she never had any documents [ diplomas or certificates ] . The war began when she was in secondary two . Then she told me , "@ You have reached in senior five and you can see that FARG is helping us ; they provide us with school funds , transport and other school expenses . It is a high time I also went back to school . @" Immediately she started looking for a school and started studying as soon as she got one . FARG continued to help us until 2002 when they [ FARG ] gave us a house in the Kimironko residences , which were constructed for children who live on their own [ orphans ] . We started living in that house . Later FARG was decentralised and they stopped helping people . When they did ... I had finished my studies before they stopped helping us . Then I got a temporary job in Ibuka . I worked and the money was helpful . My sister was actually able to get some of the school material she needed . Then the job stopped and life stopped too .
Ubwo ubuzima rero , sinzi...sinakubwira ngo ubuzima bwacu bumeze gutya , ubuzima bwacu burakomeye . Wenda niba ugize ikibazo , ugerageza kukiihanganira , kuko nta wundi wacyereka . Ubu uwo mukuru wanjye nawe ageze nawe cinqui√®me s√©condaire [ muwa gatanu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] . Ariko nagize Imana nanjye ndangije mbona dipl√¥me , ariko ubuzima bwacu kuri ubungubu ni ubuzima bugoranye . Wenda sinavuga ngo umuntu ariheba , ngerageza kwicalma [ gutuza ] . Kugirango wenda ubone imibereho , ni uko uba ubonye nk' umuntu akakugirira impuhwe , cyangwa se akakwibuka . Akavuga ati @: "@ uyu mwana ibyo aribyo byose reka mufashe muri ubu buryo . @" Iyo utamubonye nabwo , ubwo nyine urakomeza bwa buzima bubi bugakomeza bukakugendaho . ||| Now I can not tell you hoe exactly life is , all I can say is life is really hard on us . When one has a problem , he or she tries to bear with it because there is no one to solve the problem for you . Today my older sister is in senior five . I was lucky to succeed and get a diploma . However life is currently very hard . Well , I can not say that we are desperate ; we always try to be serene and look for a living . Sometimes we meet good Samaritans who have pity on us or remember us and say , "@ I will help these kids in such and such a way . @" And when you do n't get such people , life still goes on though in such a misarable way .
Cyane cyane ariko , ubuzima budukomerera cyane...cyane , muri iki gihe ni ubuzima bw' imibereho . Kuko mu mibereho y' umuntu , iyo udafite ahantu ukura ikigutunga , ntubone n' umuntu ugufasha , ntubone n' umuntu ukwitaho , ntubone n' umuntu ukubaza ikikubabaje , igihe cyose wumva yuko ubuzima bwawe bugeze kure . ||| Mostly , the hardest part in life is how to find food . Because in life when you neither have where to get food from nor someone to help or care about you ; someone to find out if you have any problem , you feel like life is far from treating you well .
Yee , hari utubazo tumwe nakubaza dukeya , icya mbere nakubaza , watubwiye ko babaroshye mu ruzi na mukuru wawe , hanyuma muza kubasha kuruvamo . Ese ni uruzi rwabanze ? Ese urwo ruzi ni uruhe ? ||| There are some questions we would like to ask you ... First , you told us that you were thrown into the river ; you and your sister , and later you came out of it . Is it because the waters did n't want to kill you ... ? Which river was it ?
Ni uruzi rwa Nyabarongo , ariko baraturohanye jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ariko ntabwo twiburukiye hamwe . Jyewe niburukiye hano Kamuhanda , niburuka ino aha . We yiburukira hakurya y' uruzi hirya . Aho yiburukiye ni ahantu bita i Nyagatovu , niho yiburukiye . ||| It was river Nyabarongo . We were drowned my sister and I. We did not come out together . I came out from this side of Kamuhanda and she came out from across the river in a place called Nyagatovu . That is where she came out .
Ese yaba yarakubwiye uburyo yambutse , agaruka aho mwari muturutse ... aho mwahuriye nyine kugirango mwongere mubonane ? ||| Did she tell you how she crossed the river in order to go back to where you had come from ... I mean where you all saw each other again ?
Yee , yarakomeje atambika hano ku muhanda w' i Shyorongi , araza arongera agera hano ku kiraro kigabanya Runda na Taba , aza kuri uwo Mukecuru twari dufitanye...wo mu ma famille [ wo mu muryango ] wari Nyirasenge wa Mama . ||| Yes she told me . She walked up to the road that goes to Shyorongi and then continued up to the brigde that is between Runda and Taba . Then she went to the house of the old lady whom we were related ; she was my mum 's aunt .
Watubwiye abantu b' interahamwe bari bafunze , nka ba Minani , Yansoneye n' abandi . Nonese waba wibuka ... cyangwa waba uzi amaherezo yabo ? Kuko Minani we ngirango yanagutemye ku kaguru . ||| You talked about some Interahamwe who were prisoned , like Minani , Yansoneye and others . Do you remember ... or do you know what happened to them ? Because , I believe it is Minani who cut your leg ...
Umh ! Intambara ikirangira , uwo Minani twaraa ... nyine tukiza twagiye kureba ku isambu ukuntu hameze , dusanga Minani arahari . Akimbona we ubwoba bwaramuriye , arambaza , ati @: "@ ese muri wowe ndabizi naraguhemukiye , naragutemye . Mu kugutema numvaga ntakeneye yuko ubaho . None urumva nagukorera iki ? @" Naramubwiye nti @: ku buzima bwange utarashakaga yuko mbaho , hari amategeko azaguhana . Twagiye kumurega ku Karere , baramufata baramufunga , ariko yaguye mu munyururu . We na mushiki we bose barabafashe , mushiki we aracyari mu munyururu , we afungiye i Gitarama , ariko Minani we yarapfuye yaguye mu munyururu . ||| Umh ! After the war , we met the so called Minani ... Well , when we came back , we went to see our farm in the village . We found Minani there . When he saw me , he was filled with fear . Then he said to me , "@ I know I betrayed you , I hacked you . And while doing so , I did not want you to live anymore . What can I do to make up for what I did to you ? @" I just told him , "@ There are laws that will punish you for the fact that you never wanted to see me alive again . @" We went to report him at the district and he was arrested . He later on died in jail . His sister too was arrested and she is still in prison . She is in Gitarama prison . But Minani died in prison .
Izindi nterahamwe , zo hari n' ubwo wasanga ari nazo zakwiciye ababyeyi , cyangwa abandi bavandimwe , zo ibyabo byaba byaragenze gute ? ||| What about the other Interahamwe ... you never know they may be the ones who killed your parents or your other relatives . Do you know anything about them ?
Kubera ko mu gitero cyaje iwacu bwa mbere , umuntu twabashije kumenyamo cyane ni Karekezi . Ubwo niwe wagiye ajyana Papa , Kandi Papa kuva yagenda ntabwo yagarutse . Niba ariwe wamwishe , niba atari we kubera ko bari abantu benshi , ntabwo mbizi . Ariko gusa ni uko uwonguwo ari we namenye mo , uwo bitaga Karekezi niwe namenye mo gusa , amazina . ||| In the group of attackers who first attacked our home , the person we managed to identify was Karekezi . He is the one who took our father away . And since our father left , he has never come back . But I do n't know if he is the one who killed him or his companions because they were very many . But he is the only one I knew in the whole group of attackers . He is called Karekezi . He is the only one whose name I knew .
Yaba akiriho se cyangwa ... ? ||| undefined
Ariho , bari baranamufunze . Karekezi yishe abantu benshi cyane , ba...ba ... nawe iyo umubajije uti @: "@ wishe abantu bangahe ? @" Aravuga ati @: "@ simbazi . @" Bari baramufunze ariko nyuma baramufunguye , ngo @: yarireze , yemera icyaha . Baramufunguye ubu ari mu rugo . ||| He is still alive . He was once arrested ; Karakezi killed a lot of people . Even if you asked him , "@ How many people did you kill ? @" He would say he does n't know . He was arrested for some time and later they released him becaused he said the truth and admitted his crimes . Now he is at his home .
None se nkomoje kuri ibyo , ndumva byaba byarabaye mu rwego rwa gacaca . Ubwo se iyo yemeye icyaha yemera ko yishe n' abo bantu ? ||| Well according to what you have told me ; it seems like all that happened was in the context of Gacaca . Tell me , when one admits their crime , does it mean they have also admitted that they killed people ?
Ntabwo mbizi ibyongibyo , niba abongabo nabo...niba abongabo nabo abemera yuko yabishe . Ariko we iyo umubajije aravuga ati @: "@ nishe abantu benshi . Abo nishe sinzi umubare wabo , gusa nzi ko nishe abantu benshi . @" ||| I do n't know about that . I do n't know if he actually admits that he killed those people . But when you try asking him , he says , "@ I killed a lot of people and I can not tell the exact number , all I know is that I killed so many people . @"
None se yaba yaraje kubasaba imbabazi ? ||| Did he come to apologise to you ?
Oya , ntabwo yaje . ||| No he 's never come .
None se dukomoje kuri ibyo , wowe utekereza iki kuri Gacaca ? ||| Well , considering that , what do you think of the Gacaca court ?
Njyewe kuri Gacaca ukuntu nyitekerezaho , abantu bishe , bishe babifitiye umugambi . Umuntu rero njyewe aje imbere yanjye , aje kunsaba imbabazi kubera ko yishe , yaranyiciye . Yishe abishaka kandi abikuye ku mutima , ni uko ubutegetsi bwamuhana bukurikije cat√©gorie [ urwego arimo ] y' ukwica kwe . ||| What I think about Gacaca court ... people who killed had a goal in doing so . Therefore , when someone comes to me asking for forgiveness because he killed people , my people ... they killed intentionally with all their hearts ... Therefore , the law should punish them according their crimes .
Hari ibintu bimwe biku ... hari ikintu gikunze kuvugwa cyane kijyanye n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . Ese wowe nk' umuntu wagiriwe nabi bingana gutya , na n' ubu ukaba ukibayeho mu ngaruka zibyo bintu byabaye . Ubona bishoboka cyangwaa ... wowe ubibona gute ? ||| There is something that is often talked about , something concerning unity and reconciliation . To somebody like you who was hurt to that extent and who is still suffering the consequences of their deeds even today . Do you find it possible ... or what is your point of view ?
Njyewe ku ruhare rwanjye , kubera nk' uko nabuze abantu nkaba nsigaye iheruheru . Njyewe umuntu wanyiciye , ni uko yahabwa igihano nawe kimutoucha [ kimukoraho ] , nawe akumva yuko nawe yagize nabi . Kuko sinavuga wenda ngo ... ngo nibamwice , si njyewe wabivuga yabibwirwa n' amategeko . Njyewe nta burengazira nabona , ariko jyewe ku bwanjye bamwica . Ariko ku burengazira bw' amategeko , bamuha igihano kijyanye n' icyaha yakoze . ||| Personally , as someone who lost everyone and is now living miserably , I believe those who killed should be strongly punished in a way that would affect them . So that they also feel how wrong what they did is . Because I can not say that ... that they should kill them too . It 's not my place to say so , it is the role of the law , and I do n't have that right . But personally I would suggest they kill them . But as far as the law is concerned , they should be given punishments according to the crimes they committed .
Nonese...eeh , ibyo aribyo byose iyo umuntu yanyuze mu bintu nk' ibyo wanyuzemo , akaba abaho mu buzima nk' ubwo uriho , kubera nk' ibyo wanyuzemo , aba afite umwihariko we . Wowe nko kuba umuntu wacitse ku icumu wumva ari ikintu...bivuze iki ? Wumva wabisobanura gute ... ? ||| Well , when a person experiences some things the way you did and then lives the way you are living due to his or her past , he or she gains some life experience . Therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ? Could you explain about it ?
Mbisobanura ? ||| Explain about what ?
Uvuga uti @: "@ umuntu uwacitse ku icumu ameze atya , afite ibibazo bingana gutya , yiyumva gutya . @" Unakurikije n' ubuzima buriho , na ... n' ibiriho bibaho byose , bigerageza gutunganya kiriya kibazo . ||| You may say that Genocide survivors are this or that way , they encounter such or such problems , and they feel this way ... considering their living and all that is happening to them as they are trying to solve their problems .
Nk' umuntu...nk' umuntu nkanjye wahuye n' ikibazo , ukuntu numva Jenoside . Hari ukuntu utekereza nk' ubuzima wagiye unyuramo , ukagereranya n' ubwo uriho ubu , ukabona ntaho wavuye , nta n' aho wagiye . Iyo ubonye bimeze gutyo , wiha amahoro . Kuko utihaye amahoro , washiduka wagiye no mu muhanda wasaze , kandi noneho ukanezeza babandi bakugiriye nabi . Ariko iyo wihaye amahoro nta n' umenya icyo utekereza , gusa urabyihorera ugatuza , ugategereza ubundi buzima buri imbere , ubu twe tuzi ibyashize ariko ntabwo tuzi ibiri imbere . Utegeza nyine ikiri imbere niba ari kiza se , cyangwa se niba ari kibi , nyine mu buzima ugategereza ibindi biri imbere yawe . ||| As a person who ... someone like me who got several problems . The way I understand the genocide...there is a time you think about all the things you went through and try to compare it with the life you are leading now ; then you come to realise that there is no difference between your past and your present . And when thing are like that , you just try to ignore it all . Because if you can not find a way to ignore it , you might end up on the streets , crazy . This would only contribute to making happy your enemies . But when you try to be still and not let even a single person know what you are thinking about . You just have to calm down and think about the future . We only know the past ; we do n't know the future . We can only wait for the future , if it happens to be good , fine ; if not too bad . In life it is important to wait for what 's ahead of us .
Hari ikintu numva twavugaho cyane cyane ku buryo bw' umwihariko . Urabona wowe uri umuntu wanyuze mu buzima bukomeye , kandi waciye mu ibintu byinshi . Nonese ibyo aribyo byose ibyo waciyemo wabitewe no kubura ababyeyi n' ibyabayeho , ariko hari ubundi buzima wabayeho n' ubwo wenda wari umwana bwa mbere y' intambara . Waba wibuka , cyangwa watubwira uti @: "@ jyewe numva mbere y' intambara nkurikije uko iwacu twari tumeze , byari bimeze gutya ? Waducira muri make ubuzima bw' iwanyu mbere y' intambara ? ||| There is something I would like us to talk about more specifically . You see you are a person who experienced tough times and you have seen a lot of things . However , all was as a result of the loos of your parents due to the war . Do you remember how things were before the war ? Can u tell us about it ? How were you living ? Would you please tell us about your life at home before the war ?
Twebwe mbere y' intambara , twebwe twari abana batanu . Muri abo bana batanu ni jyewe wari uwanyuma . Kandi nta kibazo mu rugo twagiraga , kubera ko ari Mama , ari na Papa bose barakoraga . Nta kibazo twagiraga pe ! Wenda n' iyo no hanze habaga n' ibibazo , twebwe nta kintu byabaga bitubwiye . Kubera ko twari dufite abaturebera . Ariko intambara yararangiye , kubera ko jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ni natwe twari abanyuma , abari badukuriye bose baragiye . Intambara rero irangiye...intambara irangiye , nibuze nta na famille [ umuryango ] nimwe igaragara , yaba yarasigaye , ku buryo twayibwira ikibazo . Famille [ umuryango ] na yitwa ngo yarasigaye , ni za familles [ ya miryango ] nazo ziriho zitabashije . Ubwo rero kugirango ubuzima wari urimo mbere , ubu comparer [ ubugereranye ] n' ubw' ubungubu , ubona harimo diff√©rence [ butandukanye ] . Kuko ubungubu nshobora kugira ikibazo , singire uwo nkibwira .

Ariko ubungubu nshobora no kumara n' iminsi itatu , kandi ngaceceka . Kubera ko mba nabuze uwo ntura ikibazo . Ubuzima bwa nyuma y' intambara , ni compliqu√© [ buragoye ] cyane . Nta n' icya kane , cya mbere y' intambara . ||| Before the war , we were five children and I was the last @-@ born . We never used to have problems at home because both mum and dad were working . For sure , we never had any problems . Sometimes there would be problems out there but it would n't mean anything to us because there used to be people to look after us . But after the war ... my sister and I ... yet we were the youngest ; all our elders were gone . Even though the war stopped , not any family member was left . Maybe we could be telling them about our problems . Those who survived only are those who can neither support themselves . Therefore , if we compare this life with life before the war , there is a very big difference . Because nowadays I may be having a problem but I can n't find anyone to tell it about . For example , I can spend two days without eating , yet before the war , I had never spent even a single day or an hour...every time I would feel like eating , I would eat . But now I can even spend three days and remain silent . Because there is no one I can share my problem with . Life after the war is very complicated . Mathematically , I would say it is not even a quarter of the life I was leading before the war .
Undi muntu numva ukomeye cyane muri iki gihe nyuma y' intambara , cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe , ni mukuru wawe . Nonese watubwira iki kuri mukuru wawe , angana iki ? ubona afite imigambi imeze gute ? ||| I noticed that the most special person in your life after the war is your sister . What can you tell us about your sister ; how old is she and what are her plans ?
Ubundi mukuru wanjye nawe , ni umwana...si umwana cyane yavutse muri 1981 . Ariko ubuzima bwe nawe ni hatari . Kuko aho yari ageze , yari kuba ari umuntu wenda nawe wagize icyo yimarira . Ariko kubera ko yabuze umuntu umusunika ngo yigire igihe , amashuri ye ayarangize . Ubuzima bwe bwabaye nkubusubira inyuma .

At this time she should have been able to do something with herself . But because she did not have anyone to push her so that she studies on time and complete her studies , her life seems to have declined instead . When she realised that it was just the two of us who survived and yet she was the oldest , she had no other alternative but to leave school so that I would go to school . She went back to school after FARG was founded ; that is after FARG had agreed to help us monthly . But before FARG came , she had sacrificed herself so that I also get to some grade . Up to now , she has n't completed her studies . Normally at her age , she is not supposed to be in secondary school but that is where she is now ; she is in senior five at the moment . And whenever she comes back home [ from boarding school ] , she finds several problems . And me who remained behind , she finds there is nothing I improved because I have no job , no one to protect me , so that I also can help her . She comes from school and goes back into the miserable life that she left behind .
Nta butumwa waha nk' imfubyi za Jenoside ? Cyane cyane ari imfubyi zirera , ari n' imfubyi zirerwa . Kuko...cyane cyane abana , abakiri batoya . Kuko biragaragara ko bagombye kugira uburyo bakwitwara . ||| Is there any message you could give genocide orphans ? Especially those that take care of themselves or even to those that are looked after . Those young kids should have a way they should behave ...
Njyewe nk' inama nabaha , ni uko ubuzima bwose banyuzemo , n' ubwo bakirimo ubu , bashobora kubwitwaramo neza . Ikintu cyose babonye , n' icyo batabonye bakumva ko kibanyuze . Ntibagire irari . Kuko bagize irari byabaviramo n' ibindi bibi . Ariko banyuzwe n' uko bari , yaba bari muma familles [ mu miryango ] cyangwa se baba abirera ... burya hariho n' ukuntu uba muri famille [ mu muryango ] aho kugirango ubeho neza , ahubwo ya famille [ wa muryango ] ikagutesa . Iyo utihanganye rero ngo ubane nabo , nibwo ujya kumva ukumva ngo umwana kanaka yararutse . Ugasanga muri kwa kuraruka kwe akuyemo cons√©quences [ ingaruka ] z' indwara , icyo namukonseya [ inama namugira ] ho ni uko ikintu cyose cyaba kiza , cyaba kibi imbere ye ashobora kugifata nk' ikiza . kugirango mu buzima bwe buri imbere , ubuzima bwe buzashobore gufonctiona [ kugenda ] neza . ||| The piece of advice I would give them is , "@ Never long for luxuries because they can turn out to be so dangerous . @" If they can appreciate who they are , be it those who are in families or those who are looking after themselves...It is possible to live in a family and yet live in torture . If you are not too patient to live with them , is when people start saying you are a spoiled child . And after misbehaving , she or he may suffer the consequences such sicknesses . Therefore , all I can advise them is to look at everything before them positively ; be it good or bad . It will all contribute in building a better future .
Eeh , urabona iyi cassette izarebwa n' abantu benshi , izarebwa n' abana bawe n' abuzukuru kuko ni ikintu kizabikwa . Nonese nta zindi...mu kirundi ho bazita impanuro . Inama cyangwa se ubutumwa watanga kuri iyi cassette yawe ? icyo ushaka kuvuga icyo aricyo cyose ku banyarwanda bose , ku bacitse ku icumu muri rusange . Ushobora kugira icyo uvuga . ||| You know this tape is going to be watched by many people . Your own kids or even grandchildren might one day watch it because it is going to be well kept . Do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ? Anything you may need to talk about to Rwandans at large or survivors in general . You can say anything ...
Ubutumwa bugamije iki ? ||| A message about what ?
Bugamije kutibagirwa , bugamije ku byabaye cyane cyane ko hariho tendance [ ikintu ] yo gushaka kwubyibagiza . N' icyo wa...inama yose wagira nk' umuntu wacitse ku icumu , ndetse byanashoboka ukagira icyo ubwira abakoze ibi bintu . ||| A message related to memory . A massage about what took place especially in these days where there is a tendency of forgetting what happened . Any advice you can give to a genocide survivor and if possible , you can tell something to those who did those things [ killings ] .
Jyewe ikintu nagira nk' inama abantu bacitse ku icumu , ni uko tuvuge nk' abantu bakoze Jenoside , bakayikorera nk' umuntu . Yego ugerageza uburyo bwose bubaho kugirango muvugane , ariko niyo mwavuga , muvugana nawe umutima wawe utari normal [ udasanzwe ] . Kuko nta untu umuntu yaba yarakwiciye ababyeyi , ngo akwicire famille [ umuryango ] usigare umeze nk' igiti , wa muntu uzamuvugishe neza . Uramuvugisha ariko umutima wawe uba wumva ari ibuye . Yego ... ... njyewe inama nagira nk' umuntu wacitse ku icumu , ni uko atakomeza ngo yikorere umutwaro , akomeze avunike hejuru y' abantu bamwiciye , ahubwo yagerageza ibyo bintu akabyikuramo , akongera umutima we ukaba mushyashya . Umutima w' ibuye nyine , wumva yuko abantu bamugiriye nabi , akagerageza kuwikuramo , ndetse akagerageza akanabegera nawe , akumva igitekerezo kibavamo . Kuko burya iyo umuntu yakugiriye nabi akabona utamufitiye uburakari , ahubwo akabona umwegera ugerageza kumuvugisha , nawe ntabwo yishima , ahubwo ubwoba niho bumwica . Njye niyo nama nagira abacitse ku icumu . ||| The advice I can give to the genocide survivors ... Let 's talk about the genocide perpetrators ... Well , we try our best to talk to them but however much you may try to talk to them , their hearts seems no to be at ease [ ubnormal ] . There is no way one can kill your parents , kill you entire family and you remain like a tree [ indifferent ] , and then expect to talk to him or her nicely . Well you talk to him or her but your heart feels like a stone . The advice I would give the genocide survivors is ... they should n't always carry that burden . They should n't let themselves be stressed by the killers . Instead they should try and ignore those feelings and kind of renew their hearts , I mean they should have a heart of stone . They should try to ignore what happened to them . In fact they should try to talk to those who hurt them and listen to their opinion . I believe when someone hurts you and do not react with anger and you talk to them instead , the person will never be at peace , they will always fear you . That 's my advice .
Nk' abana bato ? ||| What about children ?
Abana bato bo , ntabwo...njyewe inama nagira nk' abana batoya nabumvisha yuko , intambara n' ubwo yabaye , ariko imbere hari ubundi buzima bushyashya . Kuko nk' umutwe w' umwana umushyizemo ngo intambara yarabaye , ukagenda umushyiramo ibintu bibi , we yakura nta n' ikiza azi . Yakura yumva ko mu mutwe we , imbere ye , inyume ye , ibyamubayeho bizaba prolong√© [ bizakomeza gutyo ] . Ariko namugira inama y' uko ibintu byose byabaye , bizagira iherezo , imbere ye hari ubundi buzima bwiza butameze nk' ubwo yanyuzemo . Ni iyo nagira abana batoya ||| Well , concerning children , I can not ... the advice I can give them is , though there was a war , the future will make life new . Because if you tell them the History of the war , or tell them those bad stories , they may grow up without enjoying anything in life . They may mature up with a belief that what will happen in the future will be the continuation of what happened in the past . Therefore , I would reassure them that what happened will end . The future will be very good , unlike what they went through in the past . That is the advice I would give children .
Ukurikije noneho n' ikibazo cy' ukuntu amahanga uzi yaba yaritwaye ku byabaye mu Rwanda...kuri Jenoside yabaye mu Rwanda , yo wumva nta kintu wayabwira ? ||| Considering the problem of foreign countries that deny that there was genocide in Rwanda , do n't you have any message to give them ?
Amahanga ? Ni uko akenshi amahanga yumva yuko nta Jenoside yabaye mu Rwanda . Kereka ahari mbonye ... nk' umuyobozi w' igihugu runaka utajya wemera ko hari Jenoside yabaye mu Rwanda . Nkamwumvisha uburyo Jenoside yabaye mu Rwanda , byaba ngombwa nkamwereka n' ahantu hagiye hagwa inzirakarengane , bashyinguwe , ayo magufwa yabo akagerageza kuyabona . Ndetse umuntu akajya amwereka n' abantu bamugaye ku buryo bwa Jenoside . Akagera aho...ubwo yumva ko Jenoside yabayeho mu Rwanda . Kuko amahanga menshi , ntabwo ajya yiyumvisha uburyo umuntu yafashe umuhoro agatema undi . ||| Foreign countries ? The problem is foreign countries believe that there was n't genocide in Rwanda . Unless I get ... a leader from a particular country that denies that there was genocide in Rwanda . Then I would convince him or her that genocide did take place in Rwanda . And if necessary , I would take him or her to those places where they exhumed and reburried those innocent people who died . I would make sure he or she gets to see those remains of people and show him or her all those who were handicaped due to the genocide until when he or she...understands that genocide actually took place in Rwanda . Because most countries can not imagine how someone can hold a machete and hack his or her equal .
Nonese wowe wumva mu buzima bwawe buri imbere uteganya iki ? Ufite iyihe gahunda mu buzima bwawe ? ||| What do you plan for your future ? What is your plan for the future ?
Njyewe ubuzima bwanjye uko mbuteganya , nubwo nabayeho nabi mu buzima bwashize , ariko njya ngira ikizere yuko uko biri atari ko bizahora . Numva ko hari igihe ibingibi ndimo binzahaza , ibibazo iki ... kutagira uwo mbwira...Yego n' ubundi nzarinda mpfa ntawe mbonye mbwira ikibazo , ariko burya umuntu yibuka ikibazo cyane iyo ahuye n' ubuzima bubi . Ugerageje rero ukabona ubuzima bubi ubuvuyemo n' ibibazo rero hari igihe byagenda bigabanuka nabyo ukabyibagirwa . Yego ntibigenda burundu , ariko hari ikintu kivungukaho , kubyo waba warahuye nabyo . Kandi njye mu kizere cyanjye mfite nziko av√©nir [ ejo hazaza ] yanjye izaba nziza . ||| What I plan for life , though I experienced a bad life in the past , I still have hope that things will change . I believe that all this that brings me down , problems ... living wthout someone to confide in ... Yes I know I will die without ever getting someone to tell my problems but remember , we only remember our problems when we get into hardships . Therefore , if one tries to get ride of hardships , slowly by slowly the problems will also reduce and finally one will forget about them . I know you can never completely forget but the burden is lighter . And I believe my future will be very nice .
