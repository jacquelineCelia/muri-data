Ubundi njyewe nitwa Nshimiyimana Claude , tukaba twari dutuye ku Kicukiro , akarere ka Ngoma , Zone ya Ngoma . ||| My name is Nshimiyimana Claude . We were living in Kicuciro , in Ngoma district in Ngoma zone .
Eh , mbere y' itsembabwoko , ok nabanaga n' ababyeyi nari umunyeshuri narigaga muri primaire , na barumuna banjye . Nabagaho neza kubera y' uko ari amashuri nararihirwaga ndetse na bagenzi banjye twari tuva inda imwe , tukabasha mbega kuba turi kumwe n' umuryango neza nta kibazo kiduhungabanya n' iki . Ubwo nyuma y' aho rero nibwo ibihe byaje guhinduka , habaho ibihe bibi cyane byo muri 1994 guhera mu kwa kane . Nibwo twatangiye gusufura [ guhangayika ] nyine kubera ibibazo bya Jenoside , abantu barahigwa , mpfusha mu rugo nari mfite umuryango hafi w' abantu bagera kuri mirongo itandatu , barapfa bose aba ari njyewe usigara . ||| Eh , before the genocide ... well , I was living with my parents . I was in primary school . I was with my younger brothers . I had a good life with no concern as far as school fees are concerned ; we were living in peace as a family . But later things changed . Bad times came from April 1994 ; that is when we started suffering due to the genocide . People were hunted , I lost my family members ; I had about sixty relatives but they all died and I am the only one survivor .
Ariko ubwo hagati aho , ubwo baza kwica murugo nyine , baje ari benshi abazanye intwaro , abafite impiri , abafite iki , ni uko badusanga nyine aho twari turi mu rugo kuko twari abantu benshi cyane , hari n' abari babashije guhungira mu rugo abari hafi abari batwegereye , kuko babonaga ko nta handi hantu bashobora kuba ba ... ba ... baca cyangwa se bakwitabaza . Bahitamo kuza mu rugo rero kugirango twifatanye , ubwo niba ari ukurokoka turokoke cyangwa se niba ari igihe cyo gupfa nyine ubwo dupfe . ||| When they came home to kill , they were very many . Some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons . So they came home and found us there . We were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else . Therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . Or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together .
Nibwo rero nyine byaje kuba , ok mbasha kuvamo , ubwo baje ari mu gihe cya saa kumi n' ebyiri nigice . Baza ari benshi , cyari nk' igitero cy' abantu bagera hafi nko kuri Magana abiri , kuko habanje abasirikare bafite imbunda , nyuma y' aho nibwo haje kuza mo Interahamwe , ariko nazo zikaba zo zari zitegereje ko uri bubashe kurokoka asimbuka nabo babashe uburyo bashobora kuba bamurangiriza nyine , ibyabo bitaga ngo ni ukurangiza . ||| So it happened but ... well , I managed to escape . They came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people . Soldiers came first and then the Interahamwe followed . They [ Interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] . They used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ .
Ubwo...bon , hari harimo abatwite , ababyeyi batwite , abandi bantu b' inshuti bari bari aho , ubwo ni njye muntu wabashije kuva mo muri abo bose . Hari igihe cya nimugoroba , baturasa bari abantu benshi cyane , gusa ariko aho nari ndi nabashije kuhabyuka ngo ndebe ko hari uwaba yarokotse nsanga nta n' umwe , nsanga imivu y' amaraso , iki . ||| Then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... I am the one who came out of there alive . It was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many . As I was lying down , I stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . There were only floods of blood .
Ariko kubera ko icyo gihe nanjye ok , nari maze kuba igishushungwe numvaga nta kintu nshobora kubasha gukora hagati aho , biba ngombwa ko nanjye nashakisha uburyo nshobora kuba nava aho hantu . Kuhava byarangoye cyane , kuko ntari kubona inzira y' ahantu nshobora kuba naca n' iki . ||| But because by then I was ... well , I had become numb ; I could n't think of doing anything at that time yet I needed to find my way out of that place . It was n't easy to leave that place because I was difficult to find space where to step .
Ok ! Mbasha kwihisha ahantu nihishe , nza kugira Imana mbona burakeye , nibwo nabashije nanjye kugerageza uburyo nava aho hantu . Kuko nabonaga ko birangiye , nta kindi kintu nkihategereje , ndavuga nti @: nanjye reka nshakishe uburyo nshobora kuba nakwirwanaho ndebe ko narokoka . ||| Well , I hid myself and I was lucky to see a new day . That is when I got out of that place . I thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing I was waiting for . Then I thought , " Let me find a way of protecting myself and see if I would survive . @"
Mbasha kubatoroka , gusa n' abaje nyuma , kubera ko aho bandasiye nahataye ishati y' icyatsi , bari barandashe hano mu mugongo . Mpata ishati yanjye , ubwo bukeye baje gusahura nibwo bamenye ko hari umuntu wabashije kuhava . Bagerageza gushakisha ngo barebe wenda ko bambona , kuko bari batanze n' amatangazo cyane bavuga bati @: "@ umuntu turi busangane uwo muntu , nawe dushobora kumugirira nabi . @" Ariko kubera ko hafi ahongaho atariho nabashije kuba natorokera , ubwo ndakomeza ndagenda , cyari igihe cy' imvura , imvura igwa n' iki , n' abandi bantu bahunga , bagira gute . Nshakisha uburyo nshobora kuba nahunga ngo njye kuri E.T.O [ Ishuri rya Kicukiro ] mbona bidashoboka , kuko hagati ahongaho nta bufasha bundi nari mfite . ||| I escaped them . Even those who came later ... In fact , I left a green shirt where I was shot ; I was at the back . So I left my shirt there and the following morning , when some people came to loot , they realized that someone had managed to escape . They tried to look for me but they could n't find me . They even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed . But I did n't hide near there , I continued fleeing . It was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing . I looked for a way of going to E.T.O [ a technical school in Kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because I had no one to help me [ get there ] .
Ngerageza gushakisha uburyo bwose birananirana , ubwo nibwo nagiye ndorongotana ahantu hose n' iki , ariko aho hose natekerezaga ko hashobora kuba hari abavandimwe , nabo bari bamaze gupfa . ||| I tried all possible ways but I failed . Then I started moving around . However I thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died .
Ubwo nkomeza gutyo iki , intambara irakomeza y' icyendana kane [ 1994 ] ngenda nca mu bantu bagiye bapfuye , abo basize babatemaguye batari bubashe kugira icyo bimarira . Kubera ko nanjye bari bandashe ariko mu mugongo , nkapfa kugenda gutyo gusa . Kuko ndabyibuka , barashe ari muma saa moya , bamaze kurasa , ngerageza gusohoka muri urwo rupangu twari turimo . Kurusohokamo ariko bimbera ingorane ndende cyane , kubera ko hari abandi bantu bari bamaze kuzitira aho inyuma , bategereje ko hari uri busimbuke . Ariko noneho hagati ahongaho bategereza ko hari uri bukome , ubwo bari bamaze kwica mo indani bababwira bati @: "@ nta kindi gisigaye mushobora kwinjira noneho mugatangira gusahura . @" ||| I continued doing that and the war went on , the 1994 war . I would pass through dead bodies , people who were terribly hacked and could n't do anything for themselves . I had also been shot on the back but I would try and walk . I remember the shootings took place at seven in the evening . Later after the shooting , I tried to get out of the fence where we were but it was a problem to me as they had destroyed all the behind passages . They blocked the way out so that they could see anyone who would try to jump over the fence . They waited and realized that there was no alive , then they told each other , "@ You can now enter and start looting . @"
Basahura mpari mbareba , kuko nari nikinze ahantu ku nguni y' inzu . Ubwo déjà byamaze kuba , ubwo ninjira mu nzu , mfata icyo mbashije gufata igitenge , nzirika hano inyuma kuko haravaga cyane . Ngishyiraho , maze kugishyiraho ndasohoka , ndagenda nikinga ahongaho , baraza bakora ibyo bakora n' iki ... ariko hari ibyo batabashije gutwara iryo joro , bagaruka bukeye . Ubwo bagarutse bukeye nibwo basanze nanjye maze kugenda . ||| I was there and they started looting while I was watching . But I was hiding in a corner of the house . After it happened , I entered in the house and got a cloth and tied it here behind because I was terribly bleeding . After tying it there , I got out . And stood there at the corner . They came and did all they did ... there are some things they did not manage to take that particular night . They came the following morning . When they came back that following morning , I had left .
Ndateseka , ngira gute , nca mu bintu byinshi cyane , amabariyeri , ibintu nk' ibyo , ariko kubera ko nyine iyo umunsi w' umuntu utageze , nta kintu ushobora kuba . Ubwo...ubwo ndangije , nibwo Inkotanyi zaje kundokora , ariko nabwo bandokora ari uko duhuriye ahantu barwaniraga ariko bagenda bakura mo abantu bamwe , noneho banfonsa [ bakomeza ] bagenda aho barwaniraga . ||| I suffered ... I went through so many problems , the roadblocks , and things of that sort . But because my [ last ] day had n't reached , nothing happened to me . Later the Inkotanyi saved me . But still , they only saved me because we met at the place where they were fighting . They used to take some people , not everyone and then they would advance .
Nza kuharokokera gutyo banjyana mu bitaro , baramvura , kubera ko nari nararashwe , ariko bavura ibikovu gusa , ntibabasha gukuramo isasu ryari ririmo . Ubwo intambara irarangira mu kwa karindwi , ubwo nyine ibintu by' amashuri byari bitarajya ku murongo . Nibwo ubwo , F.A.R.G. [ Ikigega Gishinzwe gutera Inkunga Abacitse Ku Icumu ry' Itsembabwoko ] nyine batangiye kutubwira ngo twitabire ibintu byo kujya kwiga n' iki , tujya mubyo kwiyandikisha , batwohereza kwiga , kuko bagendaga ba disitiribiwa [ bakwirakwiza ] abanyeshuri muri za Minisiteri . ||| That is how I survived and I was taken to the hospital . I was treated because I had been injured . But they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound . In July , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating . Then F.A.R.G [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school . We started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools .
Ubwo mbasha kwiga , ariko kubera ko nari mfite ikibazo nyine cy' akaboko kubera urutugu ahantu barashe , kubera ko nari ntara ... , mu mutwe nari ntara , ntaratungana neza . Ubuzima bukomeza gutyo , bukomeza gutyo , hakaba hari n' abandi bana nabo baba baragiye barokoka , bamwe na bamwe tugasanga nabo bari aho , tukagerageza kuganira ibyagiye bitubaho n' ibyo bagenzi bacu bagiye bahura nabyo mu ntambara , ariko ugasanga yuko ibyo bihe byari ibihe bibi cyane . Nta n' umuntu wabashaga kuba...urabona kugira ngo wice umuntu utakurwanya burya , byo buriya ni ikintu cy' ikibazo cyane . Urumva nta kuntu wakwicwa n' umuntu utakurwanya burya , urumva ni nk' aho ari intama burya , ushatse wamushinyagurira icyo wumva ushaka . ||| So I managed to study but because I had a problem with my arm , which was due to the wound where I was shot at the shoulder , I was not very okay mentally . Life went on like that . They were other children who survived . We used to meet there and talk about what happened to us and to our people during the genocide . But days were very bad during that period . No one was able to ... imagine one killing a person who is not fighting back . It is a big problem ; killing someone who can never fight back , it is like killing a lamb . The killer was capable of torturing the victim as much as he wished .
Ni uko nyine tugira Imana tubona intambara irahagaze , ubuzima buratangira uko bisanzwe , yego ugasanga hari ibintu bimwe na bimwe bigorana mu buzima ariko kuva umuntu burya afite amahoro , ibindi burya umuntu agenda abishaka buhoro buhoro . Eh , ubwo nyuma y' aho nyine kugeza ubwo iki gihe tugezemo , ndabona ubuzima burimo bugenda nta kibazo , ok , hari ibintu by' ibibazo umuntu agenda ahura nabyo mu nzira , ibibazo by' ubuzima , ibintu nk' ibyo , ariko umuntu akagenda agerageza , agerageza uko bishobotse gushakisha ubuzima . Umuntu akavuga ati buriya Imana niyo ibizi kuko uko ibyagiye bigenda byose muri Jenoside no kuba abantu barabashije kurokoka , numva ko hagati cyane hashobora kuba harimo n' uruhare rw' Imana cyane kuko , abantu ubwabo bwo numvaga batari kuba bafite ingufu zihagije cyane gusa hatarimo ingufu z' Uwiteka . ||| Fortunately , the war ended . Life went on as it used to be . Well , life was still very hard but peace was certain . The rest comes slowly by slowly . From then up to now life is going on fairly . Well , people get problems like health problems and others but one keeps trying to look for a living . We believe that it is God , who knows . When we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that God played his role . Because human beings would never manage it without God 's power .
Watubwiye ubuzima bwawe kuburyo burambuye . Ndagirango , numvaga nakubaza utubazo tumwe na tumwe ; Ubundi watubwira amazina y' ababyeyi bawe ? ||| Now that you have told us about your life in details , I would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ?
Eh , ubundi Papa bamwitaga Macumi Francois , Mama yitwaga Umulisa Odeta . ||| Eh , my dad was called Macumi Francois and my mum was called Umulisa Odetta .
Mukaba mwaravutse muri abana bangahe ? ||| And how many were you in your family ?
Twari abanaa ... babiri murugo , batatu . Twari batatu bari abahungu . Twese twari abahungu . Ubwo rero nyine nibo bapfuye bose aba ari njyewe urokokamo . ||| We were two ... three kids at home . We were all boys . They all died and I am the only one who survived .
Ni wowe warokotsemo ? ||| Among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ?
Yee , muri bagenzi banjye . ||| Yes , among my brothers .
Ufite imyaka ingahe ? ||| How old are you ?
Ubu mfite makumyabiri n' itanu . ||| I am twenty @-@ five years old .
Tukiri mu buzima bwa mbere ya Jenoside , urabizi neza ko abantu bakundaga kugenda bahiga , bagatorezwa , bagafunga ibyitso bakagira gute na gute ; ese iwanyu icyo kintu kigeze kihagera wenda kuburyo wowe cyangwa se ababyeyi bawe batotejwe ngo ube watunyuriramo muri make ukuntu batotejwe ? ||| Before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ? If it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ?
Yee , cyarahageze , cyarahageze cyane mu miryango , hari bamwe na bamwe bagiye bazira ibyo bintu , wenda nko mu miryango yacu yagiye yimurwa . Hari aho babaga batuye nko ku musozi , ariko kubera ko bavugaga bati @: "@ harimo ibintu by' ibyitso by' Inyenzi hariya . @" Bikaba ngombwa ko nabo bagenda bimuka , kuburyo no murugo twaratotejwe icyo gihe tubura sécurité . ||| Yes it used to happen especially within families . Some people were victimized in that way . Our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were Inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift . I remember how my family was tortured and we had no security .
Kuko umusaza wanjye yari umuntu ukunda gukora hanze , mu bintu byo hanze by' amasafari , ariko tugatotezwa ugasanga nijoro Interahamwe zateye mu rugo , bakubise inzugi , bagize gute . Ariko nyine umuntu agapfa kwihangana , kuko abo waregeraga kirya gihe ni nabo banabikoraga . Urumva rero ko hagati ahongaho ntabundi buryo umuntu yagombaga kuba yakwidefanda [ kwirwanaho ] uretse wenda guhamagara nk' abaturanyi ukababwira uti @: "@ twagize ibyago ibi n' ibi , " nabwo abo wishyikiraho wumvako bashobora kuba bagufitiye ikizere mufitanye ikizere . Ukababwira uti @: "@ nahuye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi , " ariko nabo kubera ko nta kintu bagufashaga wenda bakakubwira bati @: "@ gerageza ugire gutya cyangwa se ihangane cyangwa se gira gutya , nta kundi kuntu twabigenza . @" ||| My father used to work in exile ; he used to go on long trips and then Interahamwe would attack us at night ; they would bang on our door ... but we would be patient because the same people we were supposed to report to were the ones to initiate everything . I guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it . Still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ I got such and such problem . @" But since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do .
Ariko ibyo bibazo byo twarabigize cyane kugeza n' ubwo Jenoside yagiye kuba mu rugo bamaze kuhatera nk' incuro nk' eshatu . Ariko ntibabashe kugira icyo bageraho . ||| We definitely used to get such problems . In fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . But they never did any harm to us .
Watubwiye ko hari abantu Bagiye bimura bo mu muryango wawe . Hari abo wibuka watubwira amazina , babakuraga he babajyana he ? ||| You told us some of your family members would be forced to shift . Do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ? Where did they go or where were they taken ?
Yee , ok , harimo nka mu...ok namwita nk' aho ari Marume , kuko cyo gihe we bari batuye hano i Gikondo ariko bakaba barabanje gutura i Kinazi . Bava i Kinazi , bamaze kuva i Kinazi bajya i Cyangugu , naho barabimura nibwo bagarutse gutura hano i Gikondo . ||| Yeah ... okay , there was ... well I can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in Gikondo and in Kinazi before . When they left Kinazi , they went to Cyangugu . They made move to Cyangugu and then they came back here in Gikondo .
So , hagati aho rero igihe iby' ibyitso byari bikomeye , hari uwo bafashemo wacu . Baranamukubise ku buryo yanapfuye yarabaye umusazi , yitwaga Francois . Ubu Jenoside ejobundi niyo yabatsinze i Gikondo , ahantu bitaga ngo hari Interahamwe ikomeye bitaga Kongore [ Congolais ] . Bakaba rero nyine uwo mukecuru baramwitaga ko ariwe Nyinakazi w' Inyenzi muri Gikondo hariya . Ubwo nyine Jenoside niho yaje kubatsinda nyine , abandi bakagenda babaka ibyangombwa , ntibabashe gusohoka , ntibabashe gukora akazi . Bavuga ko iyo basohotse bagiye hanze , baba bajyanye amabanga y' Inyenzi , bagaruka bakaba aribyo babaga bagarukanye . Ariko bagerageza kubisaka ntibanabibone n' ibintu nk' ibyo ... ariko ukumva ko hagati aho babaga mu muryango hari insécurité . ||| During the time when people were suspected to be traitors , there is one of my relatives who was beaten up to the extent that he died after going crazy . His name was François . He died in the genocide in Gikondo , an area where there used to be a terrible Interahammwe called ‘ Congolais ' [ Congolese ] . His mother [ François ' ] was called Nyinakazi w'Inyezi [ meaning ‘ Mother of Inyenzi ’ ] in Gikondo . The genocide found them in Gikondo . Their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work . Whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to Inyenzi . And whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from Inyenzi . They would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . One could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family .
Muri make mu rugo rwanyu mwaziraga yuko ... ||| In brief , your family would be accused of ...
Ko ari ibyitso by' Inyenzi , ubundi bakazira yuko bafite abantu b' inshuti cyane hanze , ibintu nkibyo . Kubera ko hagati ya za avant 90 [ mbera ya mirongo cyenda ] , kuko nibwo abantu hanze bakundaga kuza mu gihugu cyane yenda gusura abavandimwe kugira gute...So ariko aho byamaze kubera ko byahise bihagarara . Ku buryo nta communication [ imigenderanire ] zongeye kubaho hagati aho ngaho . ||| They were accused of being Inyenzi traitors . They were again accused of having friends in exile , such things . Before 1990 , people used to come to Rwanda from exile maybe they were coming to visit their relatives . But things changed , they stopped coming . There was no more communication among people since then .
Birazwi ko muri icyo gihe hari hariho intambara y' amoko , y' abahutu n' abatutsi . Watubwiye yuko papa wawe yakundaga kujya hanze , na maman wawe agasigara ahongaho , ubwo papa wawe yaziraga ko yakundaga kujya hanze ? Cyangwa yaziraga ko ari umututsi ... ? ||| It was well known that there was a tribal war between the Hutu and the Tutsi . And you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home . Do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a Tutsi ?
Eh , yazira ko ... we yaziraga , si nibyongibyo by' ubututsi we yaziraga ko avugisha ukuri , ubundi akazira ko yashatse mu mafamiye bitaga ko ari iy' inyenzi nyine ibintu nkibyo . Ubundi akazira ko nanone ari umuntu uvugisha ukuri , ari umuntu ukunda kugira inshuti cyane z' ahantu henshi cyane zitandukanye . Hakabamo n' ibintu by' amashyari nyine by' amako ; iby' amoko bikajya ku ruhande , uturere ibintu nk' ibyo . Kuko n' ahantu twari dutuye hari habi cyane , ni ahantu mwumvaga bitaga ngo ni muri "@ Camp butaro @"@ , za mpunzi zavaga za Ruhengeri za he bose bazaga hariya mri ako gace . ||| Well , he was not harassed because he was a Tutsi but because he used to say things the way they were . Another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an Inyenzi . He was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . Then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort . The place where we lived was located in a very bad area . You have probably heard of a place called ‘ Camp Butaro ’ . All the refugees who came from Ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area .
Watubwira muri makeya ... kuko wambwi...wavuze ko bamuzizaga ko yavugishaga ukuri , ariko...uko yabyitwaragamo hagati ahongaho , n' iyo mwaganiraga avuga ati @: "@ bariya bantu banziza iki ? @" Watubwira muri make ukuntu yabyitwaragamo ? ||| Could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... What was his behaviour ? The times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ? Tell us in brief how he used to handle it .
Ubundi ikintu we bamuzizaga , bamuzizaga ko...icya mbere bamuzizaga ko ari umuntu donc ... udakunda ibintu wenda twakwita ko nk' ahoari amashyari cyangwa se by' irondakoko cyangwa se irondakarere . Kandi bakanamuziza ko we yari wa muntu udatinya ibyo kuvuga ngo ndagutinya kuko uri umuntu , cyangwa se ndagutinya kubera yuko mbona ukora aya makosa wumve ko nyagushyigikiyemo , oya . Sasa bigatuma rero bavuga bati @: "@ uyu muntu araturwanya , kuki dushaka gukora ibi , twe twamubwira ibingibi akabyanga . @" Byanakubitiraho ko yabaga yagiye nk' iyo mu masafari akatuzanira amakasete wenda Inkotanyi iki...zaba iza video zaba iza ba Kayirebwa ibintu kibyo . Bikaba rero nyine byaratumaga bagira ikintu cy' ako kabazo cyane . Kuko ... ||| In fact what he was accused of , he was accused ... First of all he was someone who...did not like the ideas of jealousy or of ethnic or regional segregation . Secondly , he was not afraid of saying the truth , he did not fear anyone and he could n't support anyone he would see doing something wrong . Never ! So , they thought he was against them . They would say , "@ Why is it that when we tell him our ideas he never agrees with us ? @" What made things worse is that whenever he would go away on long trips , he would bring us tapes of Inkotayi or Kayirebwe 's video tapes . So there was always a question mark .
Mbese icyo bamuzizaga n' uko abandi bahutu bavuga bati @: "@ uyu muhutu mwene wacu kuki adakora kimwe natwe ? @" ||| He was victimized because other Hutus would say , "@ This is our fellow Hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @"
Nawe akababwira ati @: "@ ibingibi ntabwo ariko bimeze . @" ||| He would tell them , "@ This is not the way things should be . @"
Watubwira muri makeya mukimara kumva ko indege ya Habyarimana yaguye , cyangwa bamaze kuyirasa . Mu rugo iwanyu babyakiriye bate ? ||| Could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that Habyarimana 's plane crashed ?
Donc , njyewe ndabyibuka icyo gihe nari ndi muri étude umukecuru wanjye yari arimo yoza karumuna kanjye muri salon . Ubwo muzehe nawe yari afite akantu kameze nk' akabuvette aho yarimo asangira n' abandi bantu tugiye kumva twumva ko Habyarimana yapfuye . Ariko uko nabibonye nabonye ko ababyeyi bahise bahindura isura , ubwo urumva ko kiriya gihe twari abana ntabwo bashoboraga kudusobanurira buri kimwe cyose . Ariko nahise mbona harimo nk' akantu ko gukonja hagati y' ababyeyi , hagati y' abantu donc bari mu rugo . ||| I remember I was revising my lessons and my mum was cleaning up my young brother in the sitting room . My dad owned a small bar where he was sharing a drink with other people , and then we heard that Habyarimana died . I could tell that there was a change on my parents ' faces . By then we were young , and although they would not tell us exactly what was going on , I could feel the tension in my parents and in everyone who was at home .
Yee , ubwo nyine nibwo bahise bavuga bati @: "@ reka dutegereze turebe niba buri buke , niba buri buke amahoro . @" Icyo twakora icyo dushoboye ni uko ari uguhunga gusa . Ndibuka ko papa yavuze ati @: "@ tayari birarangiye , ati @: igisigaye ni uguhunga ; ati @: nitubona hakeye ari amahoro turahunga . @" Ariko bakaba baravugaga ko ubwo guhunga twashakaga guhungira he ? Muri E.T.O. Kicukiro , kuko niho hantu kirya gihe wabashaga kuba wahungira . Ntabwo umuturanyi yari kubasha kuguhisha ntibishoboka . Kuko wicwaga n' umuntu ukuzi ntabwo umuntu yavaga hano ngo ajye kwica hariya . ||| Yeah , that is when they said that , "@ Let 's wait and see if we will reach morning peacefully . @" All we could do was to flee . I remember my dad saying , "@ It is over now . @" They were saying we should flee to E.T.O in Kicuciro because it was the only place where people could hide ; a neighbour would n't hide you , ever . Because you knew that some could actually be the ones to kill you . People would kill in their neighbourhoods .
N' abo babikoraga b' izo nterahamwe babikoraga ari uko hari umuntu w' umukuru muri bo , wababwiye ati @: "@ mujye hariya @"@ , ariko yabaga ahazi . Biba ngombwa rero kugira ngo duhunge , ariko mu guhunga mu gitondo ntibyabashije , kuko abantu iryo joro bari batangiye gupfa . Amasasu yaraye avuga burinda bucya , bamwe ndetse n' aho twari dutuye bashinze amabariyeri [ barrière ] mu mihanda hafi y' iwacu aho hose , batangira kwica abantu gutyo . ||| The Interahamwe who would do that were always accompanied by an older person to direct them saying , "@ Go there ... @" Someone who knew the place very well . Therefore , we decided to flee but we never managed to flee in the morning . People got killed that particular night . We were hearing gunshots the whole night . And some of our neighbours had already put roadblocks on the streets near our home . That 's how they started killing people .
Watubwira muri make ugakomeza uhereye mbese kuba yarabwiye ati @: "@ duhunge , " nyuma y' aho bya ... , niba wibuka n' amatariki , uti @: "@ igihe iki n' iki ; hashize iminsi ibiri , cyangwa itatu wenda...kugeza ku rupfu rwe byagenze bite ? @" ||| Tell us in brief ... from where he said , "@ Let 's flee . @" What happened later ... if you remember the dates or if it was two or three days later ... up to his death , what happened ?
Icyo gihe sinibuka ariko nzi ko twebwe...yeee ukuntu byagenze hagati aho , bakimara kurasa indege . Bukeye bwaho mugitondo , ndabyibuka ko yafunguye Muhabura nka saa .... , nka saa kumi n' imwe gutyo arimo yumva amakuru . Ubwo noneho haza guterefona umugabo wari utuye ku Kicukiro bitaga Evode , Evode ariko akaba yari yarabyaye muri batisimu karumuna kanjye . Barimo baganira aramubwira ati @: "@ sasa rero ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ntabwo dufite ubufasha bw' ukuntu dushobora kubaba twahunga hakiri kare , ikindi cya kabiri , n' abashobora kudutabara bari kure yacu cyane . @" Nta kuntu twagombaga gukora urugendo ruva ahangaha ngo tugere kuri C.N.D. ntibyari gushoboka . ||| I do n't remember the days but I know we were ... yeah , what happened in the meantime . The morning after the plane crashed , I remember he tuned in radio Muhabura to listen to news at around five in the morning . Then some man called Evode called , he was my brother 's godfather . As they were talking he told my father how things were , he said we had no way to flee before it 's too late . Secondly , he said that those who could have helped us were too far . There was no way we would walk up to C.N.D ; it was impossible .
Agerageza guterefona , abantu bagaterefona bo hanze babaza bati @: "@ ese bite i Kigali bimeze gute ? Tumaze kumva ko indege ya Habyarimana yarashwe , ariko se bimeze bite ? @" Arababwira ati @: "@ twebwe dutegereje gusa ko hari ikindi kintu gishobora kuba wenda cyabaho , " kuko bari bavuze ko abantu batagomba gusohoka mu mazu , nta n' uwemerewe gusohoka . Ariko abari bazi ubwenge bari bamaze kumenya ikigiye kuba icyo ari cyo . ||| He tried making phone calls ... people who were outside the country would call him asking about the situation in Kigali . They would say ; "@ we have heard that Habyarimana 's plane was crashed , how are things there ? @" We were waiting to see what would happen because they had forbidden people to go out of their homes . Nobody was allowed to go out of his or her house . But the wise men had already sensed what was going to happen next .
Ubwo hagati ahongaho yakomeje kugenda yakira amaterefone yo hanze no hino , amubaza uko bimeze . Ababwira ati @: "@ nanjye ahantu ndi , ati @: ndi kumwe na famille yanjye ariko twabuze ahantu duca , ubu n' abari kwica bari kwicira imbere y' umuryango w' iwanjye hano , ati @: hagati ahongaho ati @: ndabona ari ibintu bikomeye . ||| Meanwhile he received several phone calls from inside and outside the country , people were asking him how the situation was . He would tell them , "@ I am at home with my family but we do n't have a way out . People are being killed in front of my house , things are horrible here . @"
Ubwo hakaba hari undi musanzire we bari baturanye , nawe yari afite umudamu utwite kabisa , inda y' impanga . Kubera ko uwo musanzire wacu nawe yari afite barumuna be bandi , nabo bari bari kumwe munzu , Papa aramubwira ati rero ati aho kugira ngo , ntahantu uri bucishe uwo mudamu , ibyiza reka tumuzane umusige murugo , namwe buri umwe ace ukwe n' undi ukwe , ubwo uzarokoka azabara inkuru . Niko byagenze umudamu aza mu rugo , ubwo abandi nabo bakomeza guhunga ukwabo . Noneho uko abantu bakomeje kugenda bisuka mu rugo , ni nako interahamwe nazo zajyaga imigambi yo kugira ngo babe badutera . ||| A certain neighbour whose wife was my mom 's sister . His wife was pregnant ; she was carrying twins . He had several other brothers . They were all together in the same house . Then my dad told him , "@ Instead of ... there is no way you will hide your wife , you 'd better bring her to my home and leave her there . Then the rest , everyone should find his own way . Whoever will survive will tell the story . @" That is what happened , they brought he home and others started fleeing in different directions . As people would keep on coming to hide at home , the Interahamwe would also plan how to attack us .
Ariko noneho mu kudutera bakaba baratinyaga ko ibyo ari byo byose muzehe ashobora kuba wenda yabarwanya . Ariko yaranabigerageje birananirana , kuko bari benshi . Kuko babanje kurasa portaille nini cyane babanje kuyirasa amasasu menshi irabananira kuko murugo baharwaniye iminsi ibiri , inzugi zanze gufunguka zo hanze z' amaportaille . Noneho nimugoroba nibwo bize umugambi kumugoroba , bashobora kurira ibipangu nibwo baguye mo imbere . ||| Although they were making plans , they were also afraid that my dad would fight them . Indeed he tried though he failed ; they were very many . They first shot our gate ; it was a very big gate , they shot with so many bullets and it never fell down . They fought to open the different gates around the fence for two days in vain . It was one day in the evening when they finally decided to climb up the fence and get inside the compound .
Ariko ubwo twamaze nk' ibyumweru nka bibiri , bikiri ahongaho , amaterefone agicicikana n' iki ... ubwo muri iyo quartier twari dutuyemo abandi bari bamaze guhunga , abandi bamaze gutwikirwa , abandi bamaze gupfa .

Sinibuka amatariki neza , ariko nzi ko ari nka nyuma y' ibyumweru bibiri . ||| For two weeks things were still the same ; phone calls time after time ... in that area where we were living , others had already fled . People 's houses were being burnt and people were being killed . Generally there was no place to hide . Two weeks later ... they came to kill us ... on a Friday at around 6:00 p.m. I do n't remember well the dates but I am sure two weeks had passed .
Ubwo , nibwo binjiye ari nimugoroba , baraza barasimbuka urupangu , barasa urugi rw' imbere urw' imbere rurakinguka . Nibwo bazaga mu rupangu bagezemo , baravuga bati , ubwo twari twifungiranye . Baravuga bati @: "@ mukingure . @" Muzehe aravuga ati @: "@ ninkingura , byose ni hahandi nta kundi kuntu turi bubigenze n' ubundi , bararasa inzugi ni hahandi bari bwifungurire ku ngufu . @" ||| That evening they entered our home . They jumped the gate and shot the front door and it opened . Then they all entered inside the gate but we had locked ourselves inside the house . They ordered to open the door but my dad said , "@ Whether I open or not will n't make any difference , they will still shoot the doors and open them by force . @"
Nibwo yasohotse rero agerageza kurwana n' abari imbere mu muryango , birananirana , nibwo bamukubise urusasu yikubita hasi , ubwo abandi nibwo babashije kujya mu mazu rero , bati @: "@ mwese musohoke hanze . @" Barasohoka .

Then other militias entered in the house and ordered everybody to get out . Everyone got out ; it was a very long line of people . What I heard at last was people making noise . After that I saw people holding clubs and smashing other people . They were of different types ; some were shooting and others would finish up using clubs and machetes ...
Ntiwatubwiye neza ariko uwo murongo w' abantu . Wari uturutse he ? Ni abari bahahungiye ... ? ||| You did not clearly explain about that long line of people , where was that line coming from ? Was it the people who had hid there ... ?
Uwo murongo w' abantu , uwo murongo w' aba ... abari bari mu rugo ni abari bari mu rupangu n' ubundi bari bahahungiye . Kuko Muzehe yarabaterefonnye arababwira ati @: "@ mwebwe nimubona binaniranye , bamwe mubohereze hano murugo , abandi mucicikane , buri umwe ahunge ukwe ahunge ukwe , ntimugende muri mwese .

They had sought refuge at home . My dad would call people and tell them that in case things got worse where they were , some should come to his house while others flee to other areas . He would warn them from fleeing in a big group saying that , in case they ambushed them , they would die in a big number . "@ Send me the ones I can hide and tell the strong boys and girls to flee in separate directions . Do n't let them flee in a big number . @" He would tell them .
Ariko ku bwe nyine yabonaga ko bitashoboka kuko cyane cyane yababazwaga n' abo bana batoya , n' abo bagore babo batari bubashe kwiruka , bari bugende bica umugenda . Ariko nk' umuntu w' umugabo aravuga ati @: "@ byibura barandwanya ndi bwiruke bandase wenda cyangwa se bankubite umuheto [ kumurasa n' umuheto ] nkomeze ariko wenda kugeza igihe ndibuze gupfira , ariko tudapfanye n' umuryango wose . @" ||| He never thought that such a thing would happen . Mostly , he felt pity for the children and the women who were n't able to run . He thought such people would easily be killed . At least a man is capable of fighting or running . Even if they are shot while trying to run they can keep on running only if they are not fleeing with the rest of their family .
Yee , ubwo rero uwo murongo badusohoye twari benshi , badushyira hanze . Ubwo barasa uwo babanzagaho nyine wabo , ubwo barakomeza , jye bandashe ndi uwa ... ndi uwa gatanu . ||| They got us out of the house . We were very many forming a rank and they took us outside . They would shoot every person to get out , I was the fifth person to be shot .
Bamaze kundasa , ariko ubwo mu kundasa akaba yarandasaga njye nshaka gutoroka . Kuko ahantu twari twicaye hari hari ikintu k' ikigunguzi kiri hejuru cy' amabuye , ariko hakaba hari akantu k' akaryango k' inyuma bari bagize barashe karafunguka , ubwo noneho bo binjira ari benshi kuburyo uwo muryango narawurebaga nkabona ko nta muntu uhahagaze . Sasa muri kwa kujya guhaguruka gutya nibwo yahise andasa hano [ yerekana mu irugu ] nikubita hasi . Ubwo nikubise hasi , niba yaraketse ko napfuye simbizi . Anca hejuru , arasa ubwo abandi bari bari iruhande rwanjye ||| After shooting me ... they shot me while I was trying to escape ; I was sitting somewhere where there was a drum supported by stones . Around there , there was a small door , which they [ militias ] had shot and it was open ... the militias entered in a big number and I could see that no one was standing at the door . As I was trying to stand up , he shot me here [ he shows ] and I fell down . When I fell down , maybe he thought I was dead . He skipped me and shot those who were around me .
Ubwo barangije , umwe ati @: "@ ariko , ati @: ibi ntibihagije , ati @: nimufungure grenade . @" Baba barayifunguye . N' ubungubu mfite ahantu zamfashe hano , mfitemo fragment ebyiri .

Sinabyitaho , ndavuga nti @: sasa nimpumeka , abantu baranyumva . ||| At the end one of them said , "@ This is not enough , open a grenade . @" They opened one . I even still have its scars somewhere here ; I have two fragments inside ere . As they threw the grenade , I was also hurt but it just felt like an injection so I ignored it . I thought in case I breathed , they would hear me .
Nanjye nguma muri ya maraso ndaceceka ndaturiya gusa...Ariko ubwo ishati ubwo inyuma yahindutse amaraso , abandyamye hejuru bose babaye amaraso .

My shirt was full of blood and everyone who was lying on top of me had blood all over . I just kept quiet . And then they threw another grenade and some of them walked over people 's bodies stabbing them with knives . I did n't notice one who wanted to stab me . Fortunately he missed and hit the ground on the grass instead . I sensed that it was me he wanted to stab . He again raised up the knife and stabbed me on the shoulder . When he saw me bleeding , he thought we were all dead .
Nibwo bazamukaga . Ariko muri uko kuzamuka ubwo bazamukaga mbareba . Noneho icyo nakoze nahise negura umutwe , ngize ntya ngize gutya , nsanga abantu bose nta n' umwe uri kuvuga , bose babaye intumbi intumbi bose . Ndabyuka ndahagarara . Gusa ikintu njyewe nibuka nakoze , ninjiye munzu , nsohora ikiringiti , imvura yaragwaga , kinini cyane ; ndorosa . Maze korosa icyo nafashe nahise mfata igitenge cy' umukecuru ndakitera . ||| Therefore , they left . I was watching them as they were leaving . I rose up my head a bit but everybody was silent ; they were all dead . I stood up ... One thing I remember is the way I entered the house and picked up the blanket ; it was raining and the blanket was very big . Therefore , I covered them and covered myself with a loincloth , which belonged to my mum .
Ariko ubwo nkumva nabaye igishushungwe ndavuga , ese @: njye munzu ndyame ? Numvaga nta n' umutima ngifite , bya bindi byo kuvuga ngo umuntu ararira , numvaga nta n' amarira , habe n' igitonyanga . Gusa ahubwo natekerezaga ibintu bimbayeho izo saha , nkumva nanjye binshobeye . ||| I had lost my mind ; I would wonder if I should get into the house and sleep . I was confused . Sometimes people cry but I did n't have tears to cry , not even a drop . Instead I would think about what had happened to me and I 'd suddenly feel so confused .
Mu gihe nkiri muri ibyongibyo , baba barasimbutse na none baragarutse . Bagarutse kubera ko ishati yanjye nari nayitaye aho , kuko bwari bumaze no kwira , hahise haba urufaya rw' amasasu menshi . Kuko mu rugo baharasiye amasasu menshi cyane ariko . Menshi menshi , kuburyo n' abandi bantu bari batuye ahongaho b' abaturanyi n' iki ... nyuma y' aho ngira ngo bamwe banatangiye no guhunga , abandi batekereza ko ahari ashobora kuba ari Inkotanyi zirimo kurwana n' Interahamwe . Gusa abenshi babimenye mu gitondo , bamwe bashungereye , abandi baje gusahura , ubwo nibwo jyewe nahise mva ahongaho . Ubwo maze guhunga nyine nanjye...ariko ubwo hagati ahongaho muri iyo minsi yose ukuntu Jenoside yagiye igenda hagati y' iyo minsi , ni ukonguko byagiye bigenda nyine , ni ibyo nagiye mbona hagati ahongaho . ||| While I was still there , they jumped back the fence and got in . I had left my shirt there ... it was even becoming dark . They shot many bullets to the extent that some of the neighbours fled and others thought it was a contest between the Inkotayi and the Interahamwe . The majority were informed about what it was the following day . Several people came to watch us ; others were looting our properties . That was when I left the place . After fleeing I ... meanwhile during all those days genocide was worsening . That is what I saw in the meantime .
Waba uzi urupfu rw' abo mwavukanaga ndetse n' urwa mama wawe ? Watubwiye ko papa we bamurashe . ||| Do you know how your family members died ... ? I mean your brothers and sisters and your mum . You told us that your dad was shot ...
Yee , Umukecuru nawe baramurashe gusa , yari umuntu w' umurokore ukunda kwisengera , numvaga za Yezu Kristu gusa . Ubwo barumuna banjye nabo ubwo , bari begeranye gutya . Kuko babicaje ku murongo , bari bicaye ku murongo nk' uko twaba twicaye gutya . Ubwo abandi numva induru ku ruhande...iki , hakaba ariko hari harimo umutante wanjye umwe , ni uko nyine nta kundi byari kugenda ariko iyo abasha nko kubona ubufasha wenda aba yaranakize kuko we yampfiriye mu ntoki kabisa gutya . Nta bundi bufasha nari mfite , nta ki ... yari afite inda y' impanga , ubona kabisa ko agifite umwuka . ||| Yes ... my mum was also shot . She was a "@ born again Christian . @" She liked praying so much ; all I would hear her say was , "@ Jesus Christ @"@ . And my brothers were next to each other ; they were made to sit in a line like this ... I heard people screaming besides . I remember my aunt ... there was no other way but if I had had help , she would have survived . She died in the banana plantation but I too was helpless , I could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant . For her she still had some strength to breathe .
Kuko nta kindi kintu nari kubasha gukora nanjye , numvaga nanjye ntazi ukuntu nabaye . Kuko we mamusize ahongaho bimaze kurangira , nibwo njyewe nahise ngenda . Ariko ubwo muri uko kubyuka , nta n' umwe wakomaga , Umukecuru we bari barangije kumurangiriza , bamaze kumurasa , bamurashe amasasu atatu . Abiri yaciye hano irindi rica hano , barumuna banjye bo bagiye babakubitagura ubuhiri , amasasu aha [ yerekanye mu mutwe ] n' iki , kuko yari umuvu munini cyane w' amaraso menshi cyane . ||| There was nothing I could do for her , myself I had lost conscience due to what had happened to me . I left her after she had breathed her last breath . By the time I left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead . They shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here . My brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head . There was a big stream of blood .
Ariko warahavuye ntiwongeye kumenya ngo ... ||| But when you left , you never got a chance to know that ...
Nta kindi kintu nongeye kumenya . Gusa icyo nzi cyo nongeye kumenya nyuma yaho ni uko gusa naje intambara irangiye byabindi nyine , Jenoside imaze kurangira , ubwo aribwo igihugu kigitangira nyine kwisanasana n' iki . Nibwo naje nsanga intumbi gusa ziri aho mu rupangu hose zirajyaye , ahantu hose . Mbasha gushaka abamfasha , kuko hariho abandi bacitse ku icumu bagenzi banjye bo kuri uwo murenge , babashije wenda kumfasha kuba umuntu yapfa kubarenzaho agataka gusa kugira ngo umuntu arebe ... ||| I never got another chance to know what happened next . I came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up . And I found only corpses lying in the compound . I tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide . They helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ...
Icyo gihe washoboraga kumenya ababyeyi bawe cyangwa ... ||| By that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ?
Icyo gihe ntabwo nabashaga kubamenya buretse nk' ipantaro papa yari yambaye n' igitenge umukecuru yari yambaye . Ok , wenda na burumuna bwanjye nabwo nabashaga kumenya wenda nk' igice cy' umwenda yari yambaye , ikabutura cyangwa se ishati , ibintu nk' ibyongibyo . ||| By that time , I could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing . I could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing . Things like that .
Wabashije kubashyingura mu cyubahiro ? ||| Were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ?
Mu cyubahiro ntabwo byabashije , kubera ko kirya gihe urabona ubuzima bwari , abantu niyo bari bakiva mu bibazo n' igihugu ariyo kigitangira kwisuganya kugira ngo barebe ko batangira kudemara . Urebye ntabwo twakoze ibintu bindi bihambaye nta kindi , twafashe gusa , dushaka imyenda myiza n' iki , ni uko turabasasira mo indani , turenzaho itaka . Gusa icyo twakoze twamennyeho ikintu cy' igisima cyo hejuru gusa nta kindi kintu . ||| I was n't able to do that . You see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal . We did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony . We just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil . Then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else .
Watubwira muri makeya kuva uvuye aho kugeza Inkotanyi zifatiye igihugu . Ubuzima bwawe bwari ... watubwira muri make uko wabayeho ? ||| Would you please tell us in brief how your life was , from the time you left your home to the time the Inkotanyi captured the country . What was your life like ... tell us in brief how you were living ?
Gusa hagati aho muri Jenoside bwo narasufuye [ naratesetse ] cyane , kuko nagiye mpura n' ibibazo kandi ... ||| Generally , during the genocide , I suffered a lot because I got many problems yet ...
Kuva uvuye mu rugo . ||| From the time you left your home .
Mvuye mu rugo ubwo narakomeje ndagenda , ariko ubwo muri uko gukomeza , niko ngifite n' abampiga inyuma , kuko bagerageje gushakisha ahantu hose , bava ndetse n' aho bitaga ku Kicukiro bajya i Gikondo . Ahandi hantu twari dufite amazu , baza kureba ko wenda abantu b' aho aribo baba bampishe . Ahubwo basanga na hariya sinigeze mpagera . ||| When I left home I continued to walk . But even as I was going , there were some people who were behind me . They tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving Kicuciro for Gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there . Therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me . They found out that I never went there .
Ubwo hagati ahongaho aho souffrance [ imibabaro ] zirangiye , nibwo maze guhura n' inkotanyi nabashije nabo kubasobanurira ibibazo nahuye nabyo , mbabwira n' aho narokokeye . Bagerageza kumfasha uko bishoboka , barambwira bati @: "@ ese bite ? @" Ndababwira nti @: gusa ikibazo mfite ni imvune , kandi murabona hari haraboze kabisa , kuko nta muti nabonaga nta n' ikintu nabonaga kimvura . Babasha kunyondora , n' iki . Barambwira bati @: "@ genda usubire mu buzima bwawe busanzwe . @" Ariko ubu hagati aha ibyo aribyo byose ndabona ubuzima bwanjye , ok , si bwiza cyane , ariko nta n' ubwo ari bubi , kuko burya iyo ubasha kuryama mu mahoro , ukaramuka , ubuzima burakomeza . ||| After the struggle , that is after meeting the Inkotanyi I told them [ Inkotanyi ] all I went through and where I had been . They helped me as much as they could . They asked me , "@ how are you ? @" I told them that my problem was the injury I had . They could see it had rotten because I never used to get treatment . They treated me and later asked me to go home and start looking for a living . My current life ... well I can not say that it is very good but still I can not say that it is too bad . When there is peace in the country and one is able to sleep peacefully , then life goes on .
Ukimara kubonana n' Inkotanyi zikakubwira ngo ujye mu buzima bwawe busanzwe , wakoze iki hagati ahongaho , wagiye he ? Wabanye na nde ? Ikigutunga wakibonaga ute ? ||| After you met the Inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ? Whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ?
Hagati ahongaho...ubwo ... ukuntu byagenze ubwo nyuma , bamaze kundeka ubwo nibwo nahise njya ku Kicukiro , hakaba hari umuntu wo muri famille wari waraharokotse . Ariko nawe , nkaba nibuka ko , eh , intuza ... intambara igeze , nyuma wenda y' icyumweru kimwe . Bakaba bari bamaze kutumenyesha ko bo déjà badutanze gupfa . Numvaga rero ibyo ari byo byose nabo batakiriho , ubwo ndagenda njya i Remera hafi na IAMCA [ aho K.I.E iri ubu ] . ||| What happened later after they left me , I went to Kicuciro . There is someone from my family who had survived but I never knew ... when the war began , I guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them . Therefore , I thought they had all died . I went to Remera near IAMCA , where KIE [ Kigali Institute of Education ] presently is .
Nibwo naje kubona umugabo umwe wari uvuye i Buganda , ok nawe yari aziranye no mu rugo . Aza kunjyana kwiga i Bugande nigayo igihe gitoya ndagaruka , ino ahangaha ndiyandikisha ndakomeza ndiga buhoro buhoro buhoro . Ariko uko narebye nabonaga ubuzima ibyo aribyo byose uko nagiye mbubamo...ubwo n' ukonguko byagiye bigenda , nkahura n' abantu b' inshuti abari inshuti ab' inshuti sinzi cya ... nabo wenda ba ... bangirira impuhwe kubera ibibazo mfite n' akandimo . Ubuzima bugenda bugenda gutyo ... ||| Then I met a certain man who had come from Uganda ; he knew my family . He took me to school in Uganda . I studied there for a while and came back to Rwanda . I registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . That is how things used to be . I would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on .
Kugeza ubwo naje kumenyera nsubira mu Buzima busanzwe . Nkanavuga nti ibyo ari byo byose n' ubwo na jenoside yabaye ibyo ari byo byose ibyabaye , ibyo aribyo byose ariko umuntu agomba gushaka ubuzima . N' ubwo umuntu atabyibagirwa ariko ubuzima bugomba gukomeza . ||| I finally got used to it and started living a normal life . I would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened . One can never forget what happened but life has to go on .

Umh amashuli sinarangije kuyarangiza ariko nabashije kwiga ngera kuri au niveau [ ku rwego ] ku buryo nshobora kuba wenda nashaka gushaka Ubuzima , ariko n' ubu nda Préfèra [ ndahitamo ] kubisubiramo n' uko hari utubazo tukinzitiye gato . ||| Well ...

Nagiraga ikibazo cyo kurwara ku...umutwe .

Wigeze kutubwira y' uko watesetse cyane . Ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo wadusobanuriye neza uko guteseka ... ||| You said you suffered a lot . But you never explained very well to us how you suffered .
Eh , guteseka kwanjye ukuntu byagenze ... ||| Eh ... the way I suffered ...
Ukuntu byagenze mu buzima rusange usibye ibyo byose , mu buzima rusange watesetse gute kuva ababyeyi bawe ukimara kubabura kugeza ubu , wumva ari iki cyagutushije kugeza ubu ? ||| What happened in your life in general ? Not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now . What has been the most challenging thing ?
Ok , kuba nabura ababyeyi ? Ok ! Icya mbere , nagiye mu buzima ntari menyereye , surtout [ cyane cyane ] kubera ko burya iyo uri kumwe n' ababyeyi kandi ukiri na mutoya , burya hari ibintu...hari imyaka burya ugeramo , wenda bamaze kugukuza nawe ukamenya aho niveau y' ukuntu ushobora kuba waba washaka ubuzima bwawe . Ariko ubwo naringiye mu buzima ntamenyereye . ||| Loosing both my parents ? Well ... first of all I started another kind of life , which I was n't used to . Because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living . I entered another life that I was not used to .
Kuba nta muntu mfite ushobora kuba wamfasha wenda mu bitekerezo runaka , wenda mvuge nti nkeneye iki mbe nahita nkibona . Ibyo nabyo byari ibintu byagiye bingora . No kuba byonyine gusa ... n' ibyo nabonye byonyine , n' ukuntu nabonye ukuntu abantu bapfa , n' ukuntu nagiye mbona nsimbuka intumbi , abo nagiye ngeraho nziko aribo bashobora kundokora ahubwo nkabona nabo barashaka kunyica . Kugeza ubwo naje guhura n' Inkotanyi . ||| Living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something I needed . Those are the things that would disturb me . The fact that ... those are things I noticed . The way I saw people dying and the way I was skipping corpses , people I would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me . Until when I met the Inkotanyi .
Kuko ndabyibuka hari umugabo wa hano twahuriye niba ari...hano munsi ya sainte famille , ambwira ko agiye kundokora . Ariko twageze ahantu mbona ahubwo ahantu anjyanye , ni ku cyobo .

He assured me that he was going to save me . But we reached somewhere and I noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . I escaped him and run away ; I escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where I went .
So , nagiye mbona rero ibintu bigiye bitandukanye cyane mu buzima , nkagenda mbona ukuntu abantu bafite ibibazo , nkareba ukuntu nyuma y' aho Jenoside birangiriye ukuntu Imfubyi zagiye zihura n' ibibazo , cyangwa se nanjye ibyo nagiye mbona n' iki .

Ibyo aribyo byose nanjye ndabizi ko ubuzima bwo kuba Imfubyi buragora . Ariko ni iki wakoraga kugirango ugerageze kwikemurira ibibazo byawe hagati y' aho ? ||| I also know how difficult life for orphans . But what can you do to solve some of your problems ?
Eh ! Icyo nakoraga ubwo...ok .

I thank God that I did n't rent a house . And as far as school fees were concerned , I would n't bother much because the funds [ F.A.R.G , Fond d' Assistance aux Rescapés du Génocide ] would help us . We appreciate their help for our school fees because we would go to school saying , "@ Let 's study maybe tomorrow we will be able to improve our lives . @"
Ubwo nyine ubuzima bukagenda gutyo . Uwo mbashije kubwira igitekerezo cyanjye , yabona ari ngombwa ko amfasha akamfasha . Kuza kugeza ubwo numva maze kabisa kumenyera , no kuba maze kwigira hejuru , numva ari ibintu bishimishije cyane . ||| Life went on like that ... I would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could . Until I got totally used to it and I grew older , which made me so happy .
Wumva kuri wowe ari iki wibuka kikakubabaza kurusha ibindi , muri wowe ; kandi kikagutesha kuba wakwishima . Ni nk' iki wumva wibuka kikakubabaza cyane ? ||| In your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ? Something that takes away your joy . What hurts you most whenever you remember it ?
Kuba ntari kumwe n' abavandimwe kuba...ok , nta Famille , ibyo nabyo biri mu bintu bya mbere , ko kubaho ntawe mfite mbwira ibibazo byanjye nimba we yabikemura .

Gusa inama nabagira , Ikintu cya mbere nabaha Moral . Bakamenya ko mu buzima biriya ni ibintu , ok byabayeho kubera y' uko abantu kirya gihe bari babaye inyamaswa kubera na politique mbi . Ikindi kintu nabagiraho inama , ni uko uwumva afite ubu afite occasion yo kuba igihe cye yagikoresha neza , akaba yagikoresha .

Njye ndumva ari cyo kintu nabagiraho Inama . ||| The advice I can give them ... first of all I would encourage them to have morale . They should know that in life such things ... well , such things happened because people had become wild due to bad governance . Another advice I can give them is to use their time efficiently . If one has a chance to go to school , he or she should study . If one gets a job then he or she should work . Or if there is someone who has a farm with destroyed houses , he or she should try to build there his or her own house and put there his or her own family when they get an opportunity to do so . Any one who has a chance should use it well . That is the advice I can give them .
Ikindi kibazo nagiraga ngo ngusabe watubwira , ku bantu babikoze . Bakoze ibyo bintu . Ni ubuhe butumwa wabaha ? ||| Something else I would like to ask you is about those who did those things [ those who killed ] . What message do you have for them ?
Njyewe gusa ikintu cya mbere ubutumwa nabaha . Byo nibabanze bemere ko amakosa koko bayakoze . Hanyuma nibamara kwemera ko bishe , ubwo ibindi byo biza bizoroha . Kubera ko niba uhakana ko utishe umuntu , kandi byemezwa hari n' abakwemeza ko wishe . Njye numva ibyiza ari uko wakwemera ko icyo cyaha wagikoze . ||| The message I can give them ... well they should first admit their crimes . After they have admitted that they killed , the next step would be easy . Because if you deny that you killed yet they are witnesses who accuse you to have killed , I believe it is better to accept that you committed the crime .
Noneho wamara kwemera ko wagikoze , ubwo ibyo aribyo byose niba ari n' ibihano uzabigabanyirizwa cyangwa se ukuri kuzabakugaragaye . Wenda nibyo bavuga ngo @: "@ umuntu yanakubabarira , " wenda ndumva no kubabarirwa wenda sinaku ... hari abatanga imbabazi hari n' abatazitanga . Ariko , babanze bemere bati @: "@ twakoze icyaha , twarishe koko twamennye amaraso . @" Ubwo nibamara kwemera ko ibyo bintu kabisa ko icyaha bagikoze ibindi bizoroha . Ariko mu gihe batemera ko icyo cyaha bagikoze , kandi hari n' ababi ... n' ibimenyetso wenda bibagaragaza ko babikoze koko . Numva ibyiza ko ari uko babyemera ko babikoze . Yee . ||| If you admit that you committed a crime then your punishment would be reduced or ... whatever the case , the truth would be revealed . Maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't . But they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood . After they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier . But since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... I think they should just acknoweldge what they did .
Abantu baba bara...rirokotse iri tsembabwoko bo wabaha ubuhe butumwa ? ||| What message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ?
Gusa bo nabo ubutumwa nabaha...ok barimo ingeri myinshi , kuko hari nk' uba yararokotse [ arimyoza ] ariko kubera kuko nabo imyumvire yabo si imwe . Kandi noneho kubera...n' ikindi kinabitera ni ukubera ubuzima baba barimo . Hari nk' uhagarara ku Murenge w' iwabo akareba agasanga nta kintu na kimwe kigihari , umh ! Akabona abo Bantu bamwiciye wenda amafamiye [ imryango ] yabo arimo arakidegembya aho . ||| The message I would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading . There are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh ! But the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully .
Gusa namuha inama yo kugira ngo ase nk' umuntu ubyirengagiza gato , abanze akomeze ubuzima . Ashake ubuzima namara kubona ubuzima azabona ko n' ibindi [ arimyoza ] byoroshye . Yee , gusa ntibiteze kumushiramo , ibyo ntibishoboka . Ariko byibura azarebe uburyo abyikarumamo [ yakwiyumanganya ] nawe arebe ubundi buryo yabigenza . Gusa ashake ubuzima kuko niko bigenda . Kuko n' abatwicaga bumvaga ko tudashobora kurokoka , bumvaga ko no kuba twararokotse ni ... bo bumva ari inzozi kuri bo . Ntushobora kumva ukuntu ushobora kuza ukica tuvuge umuryango w' abantu ijana , harokokamo umuntu umwe . Bo bumvaga ko bidashoboka ariko Imana yo yaberetse ko buri kintu cyose gishoboka . Umh . ||| The only advice I could give such a person is to kind of overlook what happened and go on with life . He or she should look for a living . He or she will later find out that everything is possible . However , such a person will never forget what happened , that is impossible . But he or she should just find a way to ignore it and look for a living because that is how life is . Because even those who were killing us never knew that we would survive . To them , the fact that we survived is unbelievable ; imagine killing about a hundred people from the same family and one survives . They never knew it was possible but God proved to them that everything is possible . Umh ...
Iki gikorwa cyo kwibuka abantu bajya bakora , wowe ukivugaho iki ? ||| What do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ?
Icyo gikorwa njye ndagishima cyane ni na kiza , kuko nta kuntu ushobora kubona Milliyoni hafi zingahe zapfuye . Ngo tu turenzeho duse nk' aho ... tuvuge ngo byaribagiranye ? Oya ntabwo byashoboka .

Giha n' abandi urugero , giha n' ibindi bihugu urugero , bakavuga bati @: "@ iki gihugu ibyabaye koko ni ibintu bibi kandi ntibizongere . Gusa nkabona ko iki gikorwa ari kiza cyane kugirango gikangurire abantu kumenya aho igihugu cyacu kigana , n' ayo mahano yabaye ko atazongera kuba . ||| I appreciate that ceremony and I find it very good . There is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten . That is impossible . It is a good ceremony because ... whenever that period comes , people always say , "@ At such a time , disasters occurred in this country due to this or that reason . @" That act of commemoration for those who died in the genocide ... constitutes an example to other nations...it gives an example to other countries and they get a chance to judge that what happened to our country was terribly wrong and should never happen again . I find that ceremony very important because it helps people to predict our country 's future and it helps us to avoid its reoccurring .
Nagira ngo nkubaze ikindi kibazo , urabyumva ko uri mu buzima utakwiye kuba urimo iyo uba ugifite ababyeyi , ariko nanone wifuza ko wagira ubuzima bwiza .

Ibyo ntibiba bishoboka , ariko iyo ubashije kuba ukiriho , ukabasha kuba ufite aho uruhukira .

What matters is that you have a place where to relax or a place where you can host a visitor or a place where to throw parties and host friends because you consider the friends that survived as your family . Of course I am talking about real friends ; they are the closest relatives one is left with . You visit each other and live in a sort of community so that you do n't feel deserted . When people visit you , you chat and when there is an idea to analyze , you do it together and you are happy . If you are working on a project or studying then you do it together . Such things contribute to our own development . I guess that the best thing to do .

When you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts . It is time for every Rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country . They should love each other as Rwandans . Rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country . Conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation .

But in the end it will happen . It is even taking place nowadays . Today people do interact yet they belong to different ethnic groups . They talk with no problem . They visit each other . And when it 's time to share , they share .
Ariko mbona ko bizashoboka . Kuko mbona ko niyo ntabwe yatangiye ... kuko ibyo aribyo byose , numva n' uzasubira inyuma akaba yakwanga wenda iyo ntabwe , ndumva ibyo aribyo byose njye ku giti cyanjye namwita nk' Injiji .

And personally , I think those who do n't want to move forward and make that step are fools .

It was said that due to your ethnic group , you were not allowed to pass in school . To me , that is nonsense . It can not contribute to the development of the country .

Mbona uko uw' ubwoko runaka atema uyunguyu kandi amuziza uyu ; cyangwa uyu aziza uyu kubera ibitekerezo bye . @" Nkumva rero ibyiza icyo kintu nabo bakabashije kukibagirwa , bagasa nkaho ba ... bakikuramo . Bakibagirwa mbega , ok hari ukwibagirwa ikintu ukakibagirwa hano [ yerekana mu mutwe ] ariko wenda mu mutima kikurimo , hari noneho no kukibagirwa pe ! Ukumva ko Atari ikintu cyagutwarira umwanya muremure , wo kugira ngo ukomeze kugitekereza cyane . Umh . ||| Such a person will live a lonely life , in anxiety . At the end of the day , all this does not really matter . The best thing I would advice such a person is to concentrate on life ... to look for a way to improve his or her life . They should say , "@ Since this happened , let me be the first one to fight against it . I saw this with my own eyes . I saw how someone from one ethnic group hacked someone else from another ethnic group or someone who did not share their political beliefs . @" Therefore , I believe the best thing is to first of all get it out of one 's mind , to forget it . Well , there is a way you can forget something in the head but it is still in your heart . And there is also a way one can completely forget ; truly believing that to keep on remembering is a waste of time .
Ibyo ari byo byose wari utubwiye ngo nk' umu rescapé ajya yicara akavuga ati @: "@ abahutu baranyiciye , " kuri wowe wumva ari abahutu bakugiriye nabi cyangwa ari abatutsi bakugiriye nabi ? Mbese wumva ari bande wagiriza ibintu byakubayeho hagati y' umuhutu n' umututsi ? ||| You just mentioned survivors who say that , "@ Hutu killed my people . @" Do you personally believe it were the Hutu who did you wrong or do you believe it were the Tutsi ? Which of both sides do you blame ?
Njyewe umuhutu mbona ariwe wabikoze kubera ko nta ibyo aribyo byose nta mututsi wari kuza kunyica . Icya mbere cyo ndumva nta n' ahantu yari no guhera kubera ko ntacyo napfaga nawe . Ikindi cya kabili . Nawe ntiyari gutinyuka kuza kunyica kandi nawe ahigwa ; icyo nicyo kintu cya kabili , urumva rero ntahantu yari guhera . Ariko kubera ko uriya ariwe wari ufite Power [ ubushobozi ] ari nawe wumvaga ko afite ubushobozi bwo gukora buri kimwe cyose , niwe waje kubikora . ||| I believe it was the Hutu who did me wrong because no Tutsi would have come to kill me . First of all , there was no way Tutsi would come to kill me since we had no problems with each other . Secondly there was no way they would find the courage to kill us yet they were also hunted . I guess you understand that they had no possibility of killing me . But since the Hutus had the power and the ability to do anything they wanted , they are the ones who killed .
Hari gahunda iriho yo guhana ibyaha bita "@ inkiko gacaca . @" Yo uyivugaho iki , mu rwego rwo kuza gushaka ukuri kuri jenoside no kunga Abanyarwanda . Uyibona ute ? Uyumva gute ? Uyivugaho iki ? ||| There is a certain program for Gacaca courts , which is meant for punishing the criminals . What can you say about it ? In the name of revealing the truth about the genocide and bringing reconciliation among Rwandans , what is your view about Gacaca courts or how do you understand it ? What do you think about it ?
Ubundi njyewe ukuntu mbona ibintu bya jenoside...bya Gacaca . Kuko wa mugani ikintu gusa njye nashimiyeho leta yakoze gusa yacu , nyishimiraho ku kintu kimwe cyo kuba barafashe bamwe...abari...donc abakoze propagande babajyana Arusha . Noneho abandi biba ngombwa ko bazajya baburanirwa mu nzego zaho zo hasi nyine ahari abaturage . Kuko ntabwo ibyo aribyo byose niba umuntu yariciye muri Gikondo , cyangwa muri Remera , agafungirwa tuvuge muri ... ku Muhima . Ntabwo azajya gushinjwa n' uwo ku Muhima kuko uwo ku Muhima ntamuzi . ||| The way I consider the issue of Gacaca ... well , something I always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to Arusha . It was important to let the other perpetrators be judgeded from their local courts where the local people have access . Because ... for example if someone killed in Gikondo or Remera and he is imprisoned in Muhima ; there is no way someone from Muhima would accuse him without knowing him .
Azaza hahandi kavukire ke , aho yari atuye n' ubundi . Kugirango babashe kubona ko ibyo byaha koko bimukurikirana cyangwa bimuhama . Ibyo rero so numva ari byiza cyane , kubera y' uko iyo bataza no kubyoroshya ngo babikore kuriya numvaga byari kuzagorana cyane . Kubacira imanza byari kujya bigorana cyane . Ariko kuko bagenda bakabazana mu maselire bavukamo , amakomine bavukamo amaprefecture . Bituma na n' abangaba b' aba avocat bababuranisha nabo biborohera , n' ikigega kikadu...kikaborohera , n' abo bantu nabo babasha kujya kubashinja bikaborohera . ||| Therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted . I believe it was a very good idea . Because if they had not simplified it in that way , maybe it would be more difficult to judge them . But when they take the prisoners in their respective provinces , communes and cells , it facilitates the judges who examine their cases . And it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts .
Kuko ntabwo uzajya kuburana n' umuntu waje gushinjirizwa ku rukiko i Nyamirambo uvuka ku Gikongoro . Icya mbere bizakugora amatike kugira gute...aho kurara . Eh ! Gusa njye numva biriya...igitekerezo bafashe biriya aribyo byiza , kugira ngo abacirwa imanza bamenyekane ko baciriwe imanza kandi n' ibyo byaha babihanirwe . ||| There is no way you can witness someone whose trials are taking place in Nyamirambo when you are from Gikongoro . It is hard to get means of transport or accommodation ... I guess the idea was good . So that the defendant are judged and punished for their crimes .
Kuko ni Agahomamunwa cyane kubona umuntu mwaturanye atinyuka akica umuntu w' umuturanyi , nka gutya nkaza iwawe...akica umuryango wawe wose akawurangiza . Abana be mwariganye se , cyangwa se mwarashyingiranywe cyangwa se warakoreshaga imisi iminsi mikuru akagusura . Nkumva ko ibyo aribyo byose ibya gacaca ari ibintu byiza cyane . ||| It is unbelievable that a neighbour could actually have the courage to kill his or her neighbour ... That someone would come to your place and kill your whole family when you used to go to the same school with his children or when your families intermarried , or when they used to pay you a visit when you threw parties at home . I believe Gacaca is very good idea .
Iriya gahunda yo kwihana no kwirega ibyaha by' abantu bari muri Gereza , yo uyivugaho iki ? ||| What do you think of the program of getting prisoners to say the truth about people 's death and ask for forgiveness ?
Yee , biriya byo ni byiza . Kubera y' uko burya , wowe ubwa mbere njyewe sinzaza kuguha imbabazi , umh ! Wowe utaraziha wowe ku giti cyawe . Ngo wicare hamwe uvuge uti @: "@ umutima wanjye kweri narahemutse , kanaka namukoreye icyaha iki n' iki , kandi koko témoin [ umuhamya ] ni umutima wanjye . @" Yee , ninjye wemereye...umutima ukakwemerera ko wabikoze koko ; icyo cyaha uzakihana . Kandi n' uriya wiciye , nawe...ok n' iyo yanakubabarira yego ntibizahanagura icyaha wakoze , ariko byibura nawe n' unamwemerera ko wanabikoze nawe ndumva hari icyo kizagabanukaho ibyo aribyo byose kuri we , ku mutwaro azaba umuremereye ndumva hari ikizaba kigabanutseho . ||| Yes ... that is very good because before I forgive you , you first need to come to me and tell me ... "@ Deep in my heart I feel guilty . I did this or that to so and so and the best witness is my conscience . @" If your conscience accuses you of what you did , then ask for forgiveness . It is true that those you offended can only forgive you and it still does n't clear away the crime you committed . But if you just admit it , it brings about some change as it lightens the burden they were carrying .
Eh , iyi cassette rero tugufashe , ni ubuhamya bwawe bufite uko buzabikwa . Buzabikwa bushobora no kuzabonwa nyuma y' i...umaze no gusaza cyangwa n' abana bawe bakabubona , ndetse n' abuzukuru bashobora kububona , kuko buzabikwa neza ku buryo bushobotse bwose . Ni iki wumva...ubutumwa waha abantu muri rusange ariko kubw' umwihariko abana bawe . Ukurikije ibyabaye ? ||| This testimony we are getting from you is going to be kept in a special way . People may see it after ... when you are very old . Even your kids may see it or your grandchildren because it will be kept in the safest possible way . What message can you give to people in general , but more specifically to your future children , in relation to what happened .
Gusa njyewe icyo naheraho n' uko...ubutumwa natanga ni nk' uko natwe cyera nyine wajyaga uganira na ba Sogokuru bakakubwira intambara z' itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , bakakubwira iby' itandatu na kabiri [ 1962 ] uko byagiye bigenda , ariko noneho twebwe cyane cyane ku mwihariko icyenda na kane ho byabaye ni birebire cyane . Kuko ukuntu bagiye bica byo byari ibintu bikabije cyane . Kuko numva ko kera ngo bicaga bakica niba ari abagore n' abana , sinzi ibintu nk' ibyo . Ariko noneho byabaye ku miryango yose ku buryo ntacyo basigaga n' ikikuvukaho n' iki ... ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| What I can begin with is ... the message I 'd like to give is @: when we were young , we used to talk to our grandfathers and they would tell us about the 1959 war , the 1962 war and what took place there . Now in our case ... the 1994 war particularly terrible . People were killed in an extremely horrible way . I used to hear that in the past they would kill women and children ... I am not sure but it was something like that . But this time the whole family with its offsprings would be killed and completely finished ... such things ...
Gusa numva ibi bintu byo ntibiteze kwibagirana , kuko n' umwana nzabyara , azagerageza ibyo aribyo byose kumbaza ati @: "@ se Papa ko ntagira Sogokuru ko ntagira Nyogokuru bite ? @" Umh . Icyo gihe nawe ubuhamya uzamuha uzamubwira uti @: "@ Sogokuru yapfuye igihe iki n' iki na Nyogokuru wawe kubera ibibazo byabaye by' imyiryane mu gihugu , abantu banga abandi . Babaziza ubwoko , babaziza ko bavugisha ukuri ; abandi na ndetse bakanazira y' uko bafite ni wenda amafamiye [ imiryango ] mu bintu nk' ibyongibyo . Kubera y' uko cyane cyane hari n' ibyi ... kuko no mu kwica hari ibintu byagiye bigera n' imiryango bagezeho kubera n' amafamille bikarenga cyane noneho . ||| It seems like what happened will never be forgotten . Because even my children will one day ask me , "@ Dad where is our grandfather or our grandmother ? @" In that case what I would tell them is "@ your grandparents died at this period , when conflicts rose in the country and some people hated others based on their ethnic belonging or on their honesty about their [ political ] opinion . Others were victimized because of their families ... It went to an extent of families killing each other because of grudges already existing within them .
Nkamusobanurira uko ibibazo bimeze nkamubwira ukuntu icyenda na kane [ 1994 ] abantu banganye , ukuntu bishe umubyeyi wawe bamuziza ubwoko ubu , cyangwa se bamuziza kuvugisha ukuri kwe . Kandi noneho nkana mu considera [ yashatse kuvuga gukonseya cg kujya inama ] mubwira y' uko we mu gukura kwe ibyo bintu atagomba kubigenderaho . Ngo yumve ko hari ibyo azakomeza gutera imbere , cyane cyane nko kugendera ku bwoko , akaba aricyo kintu cya mbere ngomba kumukuramo . Ahubwo nkamubwira ko mu gihe atabafite ubwo ari icyo kibazo cyabiteye ko abantu bari banze abandi , ko habaye ibibazo hagati y' ubwoko ubu n' ubu . Abantu barangana baricana bigira gute . 'Niyo mpamvu ubona udafite Sogokuru wawe , ' n' iki . ||| I would explain to him how things were , how people hated each other in 1994 . I would tell him how they killed his relatives simply because of their ethnic belonging or to their honesty about their [ political ] opinion . Then I would advise him not to ever follow such ideologies especially when based on people 's ethnic groups and never to give importance to such ideas . That is the first thing I would warn him about . I would explain to him that the reason he does n't have grandparents , is because of the hatred somepeople developed towards others . I would tell him how there once were conflicts between two ethnic groups and as a result , people hated one another and killed each other .
Ariko nawe byibuze nkagerageza kumwumvisha ko ... aho ukuri kuri . Ku buryo nawe bitazamubangamira mu buzima bwe nakura , ngo yumve ko icyo kintu azakigenderaho . Wenda ko bishe wenda ba Sekuru kubera ubwoko ubu n' ubu cyangwa se kubera bari bashyigikiye abantu aba n' aba . Gusa nawe agakura azi ko byabaye ariko atari ikintu mbega cyatuma ... kimutesha umwanya we nawe ngo abe yagira . ||| I would want to try and teach him the truth . So that he may never be affected in his life as grown up . I would encourage him never to believe in such ideas . I would tell him that his grandparents were killed either because of the ethnic group they belonged to or because they were supporting a certain ethnic group . I would tell him so that he grows up knowing what happened . And the point would be to avoid him wasting his time doing the same thing .
Iyo umaze kureba ... ubona hari ibyo wabayemo , ibyo ukiri kumwe n' ababyeyi bawe ibyo wabayemo , ubuyobozi bwari buriho bw' amashyaka uko iterambere ryari rimeze mu gihugu . Ubona kugeza ubungubu wowe urabona avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' i gihugu cyacu ari iyihe , nyuma y' ibyabaye byose ? ||| In the past while you were still with your parents , you saw the government , the political parties and the development that were in the country then . What do you think is the future of this country when you consider its past ?
Avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' i gihugu cyacu...gusa ikintu cya mbere wenda nshimira wenda leta y' Ubumwe , n' uko bagerageje kugira uruhare rw' ukuntu byibuze abanyarwanda bakongera bagasubira mu mucyo . Bakabasha wenda no kugira ngo wenda izo nterahamwe nazo zakoze ibyo bintu zibashe guhanwa . Kugira ngo byerekane...bitange urugero , kugira ngo n' ikindi gihe hatazongera kuba hagira ikindi kintu cy' umwuka mubi kiza mu banyarwanda , usange batangiye kongera gutemana , batangiye kongera ku kwicana . ||| Our country 's future ... well the first thing I am thankful for is the government of unity ; it is trying to bring back Rwandans into transparency . They also try to find a way of punishing those Interahamwe who did those things [ killed ] so that it all comes in the open ... in the future there would be no more bad spirit among Rwandans . Things like hacking one another or killing one another .
So , nkaba numva ibyo aribyo byose nabo baragizemo ba yaragizemo intabwe ndende cyane . Kuko i gihugu ndabona gitera imbere , ndabona hari imyubakire se , n' imiyoborere se , ndabona intambwe ... birimo bigenda biza . Nkabona ibyo aribyo byose nizera ko ibyo aribyo byose no mu myaka iza ariko bizagenda igihugu kirushaho gutera imbere . ||| Therefore , I believe the government played a great role and now the country is developing ; new houses are being built , there is a change in the governance . Generally , things are changing for the better . According to me , as years go by , the country will farther develop .
Kuri ubu buhamya uduhaye nta kindi kintu ushobora kongeraho ? Yaba ari ubutumwa cyangwa se mbese icyo wifuza kongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe mu rwego rwo kubusoza . ||| Is there anything you would like to add on the testimony that you are giving us ? It could be a message or anything you would wish to say as a conclusion .
Gusa njyewe gusa ikintu cyo nakongeraho , ibyo aribyo byose ndashima cyane cyane abantu babashije kwita cyane ku mfubyi z' u Rwanda . Cyane cyane abanyarwanda ubwabo babashije kwitanga bakumva ko izo mfubyi nazo zibabaye . Yaba se uwatanga iryo jana yaba se uwatanga izo mirongo itanu se yaba wagira gute ... yaba se hari uwagira igitekerezo kizima yabungura . Byose...ndumva ibyo aribyo byose imfubyi nyinshi , bamwe bariga abandi batangiye gushaka ubuzima . Nkaba numva ibyo aribyo byose nanjye ari ibintu binshimishije . Ikindi kindi nakongeraho n' uko ndeba ngasanga ibyo aribyo byose uko imyaka ishize uko yashize , n' uko iyingiyi igenda nkabona hari ibigenda bihi ... bihindagurika byinshi ngasanga hari ibyiza birimo bigenda biza yaba hagati y' imibanire y' abantu se , yaba hagati y' uko i gihugu wenda amahoro gifite . Nabyo ugasanga ari ibintu byiza cyane . ||| The additional information to what I said is ... I would like to thank so much all the people who are looking after the Rwandan orphans . Especially Rwandans who understood how needy those orphans are . All those who give out a hundred francs of fifty or anything ... be it an advice ... I believe so many orphans go to school ; others try to look for a living . Personally this messes me . Another thing I would like to talk about is the way things are changing as time goes by . Many good things are happening , the way people interact with each other , the country 's security , which is very good .
Nta kindi wongeraho ? ||| Anything else you would like to add ?
Ndumva ari ibyongibyo . ||| I think that is all .
