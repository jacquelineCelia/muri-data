Banyita UWIMPUHWE Alice Mfite imyaka 20 Mvuka muri Komini Tambwe Akarere ka Tambwe Umurenge wa Nyamagana Selile ya Nyamagana ||| My name is Uwimpuhwe Alice . I am 20 years old and I am from Tambwe commune , in Tambwe sector , in Nyamagana cell .
Intambara yabaye ariho ndi . N' ababyeyi banjye ariho baba . Ariko mu by' ukuri intambara ijya gutera njyewe ndumva nari maze kumenyaho akenge ho gatoya najyaga , mbona papa abantu bakaza bakamubwira , ariko mbese bakamubwira ngo sha wowe tuzakwica ariko cyane cyane ari nk' umuturanyi . Ariko mbese ko bari bafitanye akantu mbese k' inzika sinzi ntanubwo banakundanaga . ||| That is where I was when the war broke up . Both my parents were there too . In fact at the time , when the war started , I think I was a little bit grown up , I used to see people coming to Dad , talking to him , threatening him , saying that they would kill him . They were mainly our neighbours . It seemed as though they were in some sort of conflict . They were not friends .
Ariko igihe kiza kugera , nza kubona intambara koko irateye ngiye kubona mbona turahunze , icyo gihe nari ndi kumwe n' ababyeyi banjye bose . Ubwo papa intambara igitera ku munsi wa kabiri nibwo yapfuye . Baza mu rugo , haza umugabo bitaga Kayishema aramufata aramujyana , mu by' ukuri agiye ntabwo yigeze agaruka . Ntabwo twigeze tumenya amarengero ye na n' uyu munsi ntabwo nzi ahantu yaguye . ||| As time passed , I saw the war really spreading , we run away . I was still with both my parents then . My dad was killed two days later . They came home , a man called Kayishema took him away , and he never came back . We do not know what followed until today .
Dusigarana na mama n' abandi bana twavukanaga , turahunga mama avuga ngo ashakishe uburyo mbese twajya i Burundi , tugeze kuri Douane biranga mbese ngo twaratinze ntakwambuka , turongera turagaruka . ||| We were rescued with my mother and brothers and sisters , some suggested that we look for a way to go to Burundi but when we reached the boarder , we were told that it was too late . No more crossing the boarder . Therefore , we failed and came back .
Tumaze kugaruka , njyewe nasigaye ahantu mbese umugabo bari bagiye kunyica mbere y' abandi bana bose , noneho umugabo umwe aravuga ngo @: "@ noneho ngo uwo mwana ngo kuko yitwa Alice , kandi yitiranwa n' umwana wanjye , naze ajye mu rugo , mujyane mu rugo mbese azajye afasha abandi bana akazi . @" Mbese ubwo wenda ni nko kuba umukozi mu rugo urebye . ||| On our way back , they wanted to kill me before anyone else . Fortunately , there was a certain man who implored them to let me go with him because I had the same name as his daughter . He wanted me to go and help his children as a housemaid .
Ariko ubwo uwo mugabo bamwitaga Kayigamba n' ubungubu ndacyamwibuka , ubwo mbese yari agiye afite umuheto ashaka mbese kundasa mbese andashisha umuheto . Ubwo mbese mama aravuga ati @: "@ mbabarira turebe ukuntu twabigenza , " yari afite wenda n' udufaranga duke aravuga ati @: "@ aho kugira ngo unyicire umwana mu maso @" umugabo agira impuhwe noneho gutyo aragira ajyana iwe , ndagenda mba iwe ba mama barakomeza bagaruka mu Ruhango mbese kuko yabonaga ko nta bundi buryo mbese . ||| That man was called Kayigamba , I still remember him . He was going to shoot me with an arrow . My mum begged him suggesting any possible arrangement rather than killing me in front of her . The man felt sorry for me and he later on took me to his home . My mum continued her way towards Ruhango as she knew there was no other way .
Ubwo mu bagarutse nabo mu by' ukuri niba yaraguye mu nzira sinigeze n' umva agashweshwe ke n' akabana twavukanaga , ubwo ndangije njyewe mbese mu bana twavukanaga nsigara njyenyine ariko nsigarana n' abana tuvukana kwa data wacu 2 . Mu by' ukuri mu muryango urebye ni njyewe mukuru wasigaye . ||| She was not among those who came back . Maybe she died by the roadside . Neither her nor my brothers and sisters survived ; my two cousins and I are the only survivors in my family . I am the oldest one .
Ubwo mbese intambara yaje gukomeza na nanone nihishe hahandi wa mugabo aranyirukana , amaze kunyirukana nanjye ndagenda , jya ahantu nijyira inama ndavuga nti noneho kuko uriya mugabo yari yaramfashe nk' umukozi we murugo none bikaba bimeze uko nguko noneho reka ngende munzira ariko ubwo nagendaga ndeba butoya mbese ntabwo nari mpazi nari nahaciye rimwe turi kumwe n' iwacu , ariko njyewe nkagenda pimanya nkareba nka hariya hakurya , nkavuga nti wenda nintunguka kuri uriya musozi ndaba ngeze ahantu gutyo ariko ndebe uko narokoka . Ariko ntabwo nagendaga nca ku mabariyeli , narayabererekeraga cyangwa nabona nk' umuntu nkamubaza nti hariya haruguru bimeze bite ? Akambwira ati wowe ugiye wahagwa . Ubwo ndangije nkapfumura nko mu bihuru nkatambika nkazamuka , ubwo noneho igihe kiza kugera ndavuga sinzagera iwacu , nzagerayo bazanyica papa yarapfuye , na mama nta buryo none reka nsabe akazi , nsaba akazi , umugore arangije aravuga ngo @: "@ akantu kameze gutya se twagakoresha ? Ngo ntabwo twagukoresha . ||| The war went on . The man who hid me chased me . I said to myself , "@ If it is so , let me go . @" But I could n't recall the path because I had passed there only once together with my family . I simply used to guess . I would look at a hill in front of me and guess that if I reached the place , perhaps I would be in such and such area . I was looking for a way to survive . I would not cross roadblocks ; I would avoid them . Whenever I met somebody , I got information from him or her about the situation . When someone told me that it was dangerous then , I would go through bushes . Afterwards I decided not to reach home , because if I reached home , they would kill me the way they killed dad and maybe even my mom . I thus made up my mind to look for a job . The first person I met was a lady and she told me that she could n't hire such a person . She could n't give a job to a person who looked like me .
Ndagenda , nza gusanga ahantu umukobwa yari ari guca indabo ashaka kujya gutegura iwabo . Ndagenda ndamusuhuza ndamubwira ngo iwanyu nta mukozi mushaka ? Aravuga ngo mu by' ukuri wowe ndabona tutagukoresha , ariko ngwino ujye kubaza mukecuru wanjye , yari nyirakuru mbese babanaga . Ubwo turagenda tujya iwe turara imvura yari yaguye nyinshi ... ndagenda njya kota banshyira ahantu ngo ningende note n' agatenge nari mfite ndagenda nkamanika ahantu karumuka nanjye ndumuka , ndangije umukecuru araza ambaza neza ngo @: "@ mbese shahu iwanyu ni hehe ? @" Ndamubwira ngo iwacu ni mu Ruhango , ngo @: "@ hano wahageze aha ute ? @" Nanjye mbese nshakisha uburyo mubeshya mubwira ko nazanye n' iwacu ariko sinamubwira nawe ahita abyibwira nawe yarabibonaga . Arangije arambwira ngo @: "@ uwo mwana umeze gutyo njyewe ntabwo namutunga mu bana banjye , shakisha ukuntu ubigenza @"@ . Muby' ukuri niba umukobwa we yaranyikundiye simbizi arabwira ati @: "@ noneho njyewe ndakujyana iwacu . Ndagushyira papa wanjye ariko ntabwo ngira mama wanjye . @" ||| Then I left . Yet again I met a young lady who was gathering roses for decorating her home . I said hello and asked her if they needed a housemaid . She told me that actually they could not hire a person like me but it would be better if we asked her grandmother . We went to her place [ she was living with her grandma ] . By the time we reached there , it was raining heavily . I was shown a place to dry up myself . I used that opportunity to dry my sarong . That is when her grandma came to me and asked me clearly where I was coming from . I told her that I was coming from Ruhango . "@ And how did you reach here ? @" she asked . I tried to lie to her , saying that I came with my parents and I never revealed to her the truth but she automatically knew what was the matter ; it was so obvious . She then told me that she could n't take such a child among hers ; that I should try something else . Her granddaughter simply liked me . Then she told me that she would take me to her father 's place . That she would introduce me to her dad because she had no mum .
Anshyira se amaze kunshyira se , yabanaga na mukase afite na basaza be , basaza be mbese bashaka kunyica nawe ubwo ngubwo umusaza aravuga kuko yakundaga uwo mukobwa we yari imfura ye aravuga ati @: "@ uno mwana ntabwo mushobora kumunyicira mu maso . Mugende muhamagare umukobwa wanjye mumwice ariko nawe abizi niwe wamuzanye ahangaha . @" Ndangije uwo musaza bamwitaga...Benjamini bamwitaga Benjamini uwo musaza . Ubwo ndangije ndahabaye...igihe kirageze hakaba hari n' akana kari gahari nako ise yari yaramubwiye ati @: "@ rero Benjamini , turi inshuti , uri umuvandimwe , uzamfatire kano kana kanjye . Nipfa mbese ni bucura bwe . Ariko uzagafate uzakamenyere dore ngusigiye inka ngusigiye byose , ariko uzamenyere ako kana . @" ||| We met the dad , but he was living together with another woman [ stepmother to the girl ] and she had sons who were brothers to the girl . Her brothers wanted to kill me , but their father stopped them because he loved his daughter so much . She was his first @-@ born . He said "@ you can not kill this girl in my presence . If you want to kill her , call my daughter because she is the one who brought this girl here and kill her in my daughter 's presence . @" The old man was called Benjamin . I lived there for a while with another kid who was brought there by his father to Benjamin . Her dad told Benjamin that as he was his best friend , he should take care of the child -@ she was his last @-@ born . Look after her , take my cattle and everything , but keep my child safe .
Ubwo arangije umusaza araza aratubwira ati rero Alisa n' ako kana bakitaga Gakecuru ngiye kubajyana babice . Ndamubwira nti muby' ukuri ntabwo uri bunjyane ngo banyice . Ubwo arangije hakaba hari n' undi mugore ubungubu asigaye aba i Butare . Ubwo aravuga ati @: "@ noneho wowe niba wanze ko nkujyana , reka mbanze njyewe jyane uno mwana kugirango nkwereke ko ntakubeshya . Ka kana arakajyana aragenda Barakica aragaruka . ||| Then Benjamin came and told us @: that child and I , she was called Gakecuru . He said , "@ I am taking you to be killed . @" Then I frankly told him that he could n't take me . Then he told me that if I did n't believe him , he would take the young girl first , to show me that he was serious . He took the young girl and she was killed .
Amaze kugaruka ati @: "@ ubwo nyine niwowe utahiwe @" nti mu by' ukuri njyewe aho kugirango ujyane unyice , genda ujye kunyicisha mbese we yavugaga ko ari bukujyane mu gitero akaba aribo bakwica ariko atariwe ukwica . Ubwo arangije ndamubwira nti ahubwo mumbabarire munyambutse uno mugezi nindangiza nsubire kwa wa mukecuru hahandi nari ndi , ndebe wenda ku hari ubwo wenda ryacya kabiri . Niko namubwiye . ||| When he arrived at home , he told me that I was the one next . I told him to kill me himself instead of delivering me to the perpetrators ; he used to say that he would let the perpetrators kill us so that he would not be responsible . I convinced him to take me back to the grandmother 's house where I was before maybe I will spend one night . That is what I told him .
Umusaza ampa umwana we witwaga Camakoma aramperekeje aranyambukije umugezi ndakomeje nsubiye hahandi sinanahibukaga neza ndahashakije , ndahabona . Ngezayo umukecuru arambwira ati @: "@ iyi sura ntabwo iri bundarire ahangaha . @" Ubwo abona burije amaze kubona ko bwije aravuga ngo @: "@ jya gushaka aho wihisha . @" Ndangije njyewe nabonye ko kwihisha ntakintu bimariye nta hantu nzi , ntaki , aragenda ashyira ahantu , ndavuga nti aha hantu ashyize , wenda ari buze kunyoherereza igitero kihansange , baze banyice . ||| [ Benjamin ] the old man gave me his son Camakoma to escort me across the river and we went back to where I had been before ; I could n't even remember the place well , I searched for it and I found it . When we arrived there , the grandmother told me that I could n't spend the night in her house . At sunset , she threw me out . She asked me to go and look for another shelter . Then I realised that it was not safe to stay in a region I did not know and that I could not hide anywhere because I did n't know where to hide . In fact she took me to a certain place but I did not trust her ; I thought she would send me perpetrators to kill me .
Ndagenda mpita mfata decision ( icyemezo ) y' uko jyewe ngomba kujyenda nkiyahura . Ndagenda ndiyahura jya mu mugezi mbese nijugunyamo pe . Ndangije umugezi uranyanga uzi ko hari hanuzuye icyo gihe hari mu itumba . Umugezi uragenda unta hakurya . Umaze kunta hakurya mbonye bukeye wenda nko mu bunyoni mbese cyagihe mu bucyacya niba ari mu bucyacya . ||| I decided to go and commit suicide . I threw myself into a river , yes I did . But the river refused to take me . You know , it was full then as a result of the rainy season . The river threw me at the bunk . It was coming to morning as the day starts dawning when the river rejected me ; I could hear birds singing .
Ndongera nsubirayo ndagenda ndakomanga , ndamubwira arambwira ngo twaje kugushaka hahandi turakubura . Nti ubwo mbese nari ndi hepfo gatoya .

She told me that they came looking for me and they never found me where she had left me . "@ I was around . @" I said . But then I spend the night with her daughter . The following day we went to gather groundnuts from the grandmother 's field . At night she suggested to her grandmother to let me sleep inside their house instead of going back to the bushes . She then promised to take me to the chief of the attackers , Emmanuel , the following day so that the chief decides what to do with me . We went to Emmanuel 's place and she said , "@ This girl is from Ruhango , I caught her while she was passing by . @" The man asked me , "@ Are n't you a Tutsi ? @" "@ My God , I am not a Tutsi ! @" I denied . "@ Are n't you a Tutsi ? @" he asked me again . I said , "@ No , I even do n't agree with what the old woman said about me . The truth is I was living with my grand mother in Butare ; however , my mum had re @-@ married in Ruhango . But I am not a Tutsi . @" He said ; " It is obvious from your looks . @" Then I said I am not a Tutsi at all . But that man did not believe me and he decided to put me on hold before killing me . They did not kill me that night . In the morning I went back to the so @-@ called grandmother . She refused to receive me pretending that she did n't want me to be killed in her presence .
Wa mukobwa noneho nawe aravuga ati reka dushakishe ukuntu byagenda bite ? Byagenda . Noneho ndamubwira se wowe uranshyira hehe ko ubona papa wawe yanyirukanye avuga ko bagiye kunyica ndagenda jya hehe ? Noneho wa mugabo wanyambuye iwacu bitaga Kayigamba wawundi mbese wavugaga ngo nitiranwa n' umwana we . Arangije ndavuga reka noneho icyo gihe za Mitingi zari zatangiye i Bugesera ndumva abanyabugesera bari batangiye guhunga . Ndagenda ahongaho bahitaga imigina , ahongaho mbese nari ndi , ndagenda jyayo jya muri mitingi yaho , ngezeyo urugabo rwitwaga Shiriduwi niba ari Shiriduwi , ruraza runkura mu muhanda aho nari nicaye nicaranye n' uwo mukobwa . Arambaza ngo wowe uri bwoko uki ? Ndamubwi , ndamwihorera mbura ikintu mvuga . Ubwo arangije hakaba hari umugabo bitaga Biya murumuna w' uwo nguwo wari umuganga ahongaho , yari anzi hamwe n' uwo mugabo bitaga Kayigamba bari bari mu nama . Araza arampamagara aravuga ngo uno mwana yahoze mu rugo iwanjye ngo n' umwana wanjye . Ubwo arangije ndagira , ubwo mbese nkira gutyo aravuga ati ugende ugaruke mu rugo . Ugaruke mu rugo muby' ukuri jyewe ndabona ntabona ahantu nanyura . Ubwo arangije ansigira muzehe wiwe kuko we yari afite moto arataha nanjye ndagenda jya mu rugo . ||| Then the girl told me we should look for other alternatives . Then I asked her where she thought I could go when her dad had chased me , where she expected me to go . The man called Kayigamba whose daughter was my namesake said ... By then , the attackers were having several meetings . In fact , in Bugesera people had started fleeing . I went to a place called Migina . There came a man called Shiriduwi , I am not sure if it is Shiriduwi . He came , pulled me from the roadside where I was sitting with the girl and then asked me what my tribe is . I kept quiet . I had nothing to say ... There was another man called Biya , who was a young brother to the doctor in that area . They both knew me very well . At that time , they were in a meeting and when they came out , they defended me . They said I am from their family . That 's the way I survived the attackers . He [ Bayi ] told me to go home . Then I told him that I have no where to pass in order to reach home , he then asked his father to take me home because his father had a motorbike . He left for his home and I went to my home too .
Turagenda , aragenda ajya murugo ngendana na muzehe . Tumaze kugendana na muzehe tugenze nka nka km ahari , barangije baraza ba bagabo bankurikiye bashaka ku nyica . Barangije noneho baragira ... baravuga ngo murica umwana wa Kayigamba mufite ibibazo . Kuko icyo gihe yari akomeye yari afite n' ingufu . Ubwo arangije aravuga ati @: "@ ubwo se umujyanye kwa Kayigamba ? @" Cyangwa umujyanye iwawe ? Aravuga ati @: "@ njyewe uyu n' umwana wa Kayigamba mushyiriye Kayigamba yamunsigiye . @" Ubwo ndagenda jya kwa Kayigamba nongera marayo ikindi cyumweru , haza undi muhungu bitaga Manueli gutya araza kuhihisha arangije ajya hepfo gutya mu masaka , hari igiti nkakiriya ahari kintuza cy' amapera kinini , noneho aragenda ajyamo uwo mugabo Kayigamba aragenda amukuramo amaze kumukuramo aragenda amutsinda muri arya masaka . ||| He walked away and I also walked away with the old man . We walked for about one kilometre [ 1 Km ] and then the other guys [ attackers ] followed me because they wanted to kill me . Some of them said that they would be in trouble if they touched Kayigamba 's child meaning me ; because Kayigamba was a strong and respected man at the time . They asked the old man ; "@ Are you taking her to Kayigamba 's home or to your home ? @" Then he replied that "@ this is Kayigamba 's child , I am taking her to Kayigamba because he asked me to take her to him . I went to Kayigamba 's home and spent another week there . There came another man called Emmanuel . He was seeking for a place where to hide and then he found a place around Kayigamba 's house in a sorghum field . There was a big tree around , which looked like a Guava tree . He climbed the tree but unfortunately , Kayigamba saw him and asked him to come down the tree . Later he killed him from the same sorghum field .
Ubwo rero ndangije ndavuga nti noneho nti nanjye bazanyica . Ariko nkaba narumvishije y' uko ngo Inkotanyi zaraje ariko mu by' ukuri sinarinzi inzira nashoboraga kujyenda ngo ncemo ngo mbe nanyura , Ubwo ndavuga noneho hakaba hari abakobwa twari twihishanye , umwe bamwitaga Grâce undi bamwita Mugeni , kandi aribo bakuru noneho ndavuga nti bano bakobwa noneho tuzagira dute ? Wenda bazagenda wenda tuzajyana , barangije ba bakobwa baranta barigendera . ||| Then I imagined that I would also be killed at some point . I had heard that the Inkotanyi came in our home village ; however , I did n't know where to pass . There were some girls I had hid with , one was called Grace and the other was called Mugeni and they were both older than I. I thought that we would go together but they left me behind .
Njyewe Alisa nyoberwa ahantu nzaca n' aho nzajya , ibintu bimbana byinshi . Ubwo numvaga ngo bari hehe ngo bari i Nyamiyaga , niba ari i Nyamiyaga ngo niho izo Inkotanyi zari ziri . Noneho nanjye nkibaza ukuntu nzagerayo , narahasigaye barangije barambwira ati @: "@ noneho reka duhungane nitumara guhungana , wenda bene wanyu bazaboneka cyangwa se sinzi mbese ibyo bya bene babo ubundi ntibyari bikiriho kuko intambara yari imaze gukara cyane noneho . ||| Me Alice as I was never knew where to pass or go . The world felt too small for me . I used to hear people saying that Inkotanyi were in Nyamiyaga . I would therefore think of a way to get there ... The girls left me and the people we were living with told me to flee with them . "@ You never know , maybe you will see your family members at some point . " they said . By then it was impossible to imagine that you would ever see your family members again . A time came when the war became very bad . And the people I was fleeing with were families of perpetrators running away from the Inkotanyi .
Ubwo ndangije turahunga umugabo mbese yabonaga ko ntari umwana we , akazajya afata isafuriya njyewe nikoreraga isafuriya ishyushye tukagenda niyo babaga bakuye ku mashyiga . Jyewe narayikoreraga tukagenda . Twagera ahantu bakambwira ngo ningende jye kuvoma , ndabyibuka njyewe nagarukiye i Rusatira . Hariya mu bice bya Butare . Kuko njyewe nabonye y' uko njyewe tutaza , mbese ko njyewe ntazabishobora , ubwo ndabyibuka kuko mu ntambara njyayo baravugaga ngo baryaga n' ibigori , baravuga bati noneho ifu y' ibigori ni yo igira gute ?

Mbese wariwo murimo wanjye mbese tugiye . ||| We fled together . But because I was not the real daughter to that man [ Kayigamba ] , he would make me carry a very hot pot on my head . Every time , after cooking , they would ask me to carry the pot so that we continue our journey . We would walk and after some distance , they 'd ask me to go fetch water . I remember I walked up to Rusatira , those ends of Butare . I realised that I was n't going to cope with the situation for long because I joined their family when they used to eat maize paste everyday . It is made out of maize flour mingled in water . That is the only food that could satisfy the family . I was put in charge of grinding maize and separating the fine flour from the big particles . Therefore , I would grind the maize until my hands got swollen . However , that never stopped me from carrying the pot whenever it was time to move ahead . It was my daily job .
Ubwo turagenda tugeze i Rusatira , i Nkotanyi icya kora ziba zaraje , bagenda bica abantu mu nzira , bakampagarika , pu ! Ubwo ndangije ngira gute ? Mpita decida njyewe gusubira inyuma uko bizagenda kose , nzapfe cyangwa bizagende bite ? Ko n' ubundi ntacyo nkirwanira .

Abagabo bansiganira kunyica mbese hariya I Rusatira , barangije baravuga ngo uno mwana ntabwo tumwica mbese n' uzabaho . Ubwo umwe aravuga ngo sha ngo ngaho igendere . ||| When we reached Rusatira , the Nkotanyi came . However on the way , the perpetrators would kill some of the people who had fled with them . Sometimes they would stop and abuse me . Then I decided to stop and go back where we were coming from . I said to myself "@ there is no difference I may still die . Even though I go keep going with these perpetrators , they may reach some where and kill me , I can not change much to my fate . @" I used to fetch water . One day , as I was planning to go fetch water , Abayi came and told me ; "@ Alice , Get out ! @" I went out . Then he said , "@ I know you very well , you are a Tutsi . You will not continue to stress us out for so long . I was suggesting we kill you and then we proceed our journey without you . @" I knew there was nothing to lie about because it was true , he knew me . Therefore , I simply kept quiet . But my hands were swollen and then he asked me , "@ What happened to your hands ? @" I told him that I was grinding maize grains and then developed corns in my hands , which turned to be boils and later on the boils busted . Then he told some men to take me and kill me . But there was a dispute among those men because they could n't decide who would kill me . That was in Rusatira . One of them told me to go after that .
Nongera nisubirira inyuma ndigendera , sice mu muhanda njyewe nkazajya genda nkicira mu bihuru nkigendera , nyuma rero sinzi ukuntu nahuye n' abantu bavuga ngo mbese ni Inkotanyi bagenda batoragura utwana nk' uko nguko nanjye bantoraguramo , batujyana I Butare .

I would avoid using the main road and would go through the bushes instead . As I was walking I met some people whom were said to be the Inkotanyi . They were collecting children and that is how they got me too . Then we were taken to Butare . We lived there until when I started thinking "@ Well , I am here but how come none of my family members is here ? Does this mean no one survived to come and get me out of here ? @" I lived there for some time and then ... later I saw my cousins . They were younger than I was and they were on their own . Therefore , since there was no good life where I was living and yet at the same time my cousins were getting spoiled on the roads , I decided to leave the place and join them . I was the oldest , life became very hard on us . I started that life of being in charge of the whole family since I was the oldest . "@ I am now talking about life after the war . @" We went to a certain man called Papa Alisa . We told him , " As you can see how our home was destroyed . There is no house left . If you did us a favour and got us a shelter , it would be very meaningful to us . We are the only ones who survived , we will never burden you as far as food and other needs are concerned . If you got us shelter , it would be of great help to us . We shall look for means to get food by ourselves . @"

Today , despite all the time gone by , we still sleep hungry sometimes . Unless ... My cousins and I go to school but on our return when on holiday ... unless someone feels sorry for us and gives us two kg of beans , and another one gives us one kg of cassava flour ... We normally find a way to survive on what we 've got . Occasionally , when it 's time to live school we worry thinking about where to go as we dread going back to our so called home . Life where no one comes to say hi , sometimes we do not go to school . At my age I would have finished high school if it were n't for such problems . Sometimes I stop because I have no means to go to school . However , sometimes we were lucky to go to school and the times we were n't , then we all just sat home .

Until a few days ago I managed to go to school for this current term however , life is still too hard . It 's difficult to get a job . Nobody can employ me yet . Of course I can never work as a housemaid because I can not stand that job . I can not work as a housemaid where every one insults you or people do to you anything they wish . Well , the man helped us with his house in 1997 until when he told us that , although his house was very small , he would wish to get a small amount of money out of it . Be it 3000Rfw or 5000Rfw in case he repaired it . He said that it would be of use to him . I went to see another old man who was a Hutu and told him ; "@ Mzee [ Old man ] , you used to be a friend to my dad . Since you were friends , please get us a small house we promise to never disturb you . Get us a house of one bedroom and a living room , even if it only has a bedroom without a living room we will survive it , we will hung curtains in the room to divide it . Fortunately the old man gave the house to me . It had a single bedroom with a small living room . It was his servants ' house .

I told him that sincerely speaking I could not get that money . "@ You know the way we live , it is your wife who sometimes helps us , " I told him . People would look at us and feel ashamed because I never used to ask for food even when we were starving to death . We would never beg food from anyone . I never go to someone and say that " I , Alice , am hungry . @" I just keep silent until when one can tell from my appearance that I need something . Because the majority of people listen to your problems yet they are not going to help you . I stopped going to school because there were no people in this world to help others in need .

"@ Why did you quit school ? @" she asked me . "@ Do n't ask me much questions , I just quit school , " I told her . By then even my cousins were still at home . You know there was so much poverty then . I told her that even others quit school besides me . Then she asked me to find her at home . I went to her home and then she asked me to tell her exactly what was my problem . I told her that she could neither do anything about my problems nor help me .

I told her that if I lost my mum and dad , it 's not because they were dogs . I told her that I did n't think telling her my problems could be helpful . We almost quarrelled . Then she said that I am undisciplined but I simply kept quiet . Later I saw coming to me with a polythene bag . Inside the bag , there were soaps and other small things for school use . But still , what she brought was almost nothing . Sincerely the things she brought us were n't an awful lot . I know I do n't have to go to school with extraordinary school material like the ones that rich kids bring at school . If I carry a washing soap , then that is enough for me . She gave us ten washing soaps and three small Colgate . Each of us got her share .

Hoping that she would get something to give me . I boarded a taxi and went there . First , I went to get permission from the school director [ headmaster ] he immediately told me "@ Alice , you will not sit for the final exams . @" I asked myself why ? I believe you understand how problems kept piling , up all at once . Then I asked him " why sir ? @" He replied , "@ You came very late after I have already taken back the forms . And since I took the forms , there is no alternative , you will study but you will never sit for the final exams . Maybe next academic year ... @" I got so disappointed that day . I imagined spending days in class yet I were n't going to sit for exams . Then I asked the headmaster to let me go back home but the headmaster said no ! I again asked him to let me go back home , once again he said no ! I got annoyed and he realised that I was . The following day I went to him again he refused . The next day I told him that I needed permission to go and tell people at home about the situation . Headmasters never know student 's details he thus gave me the permission .

That is the decision I myself made . I decided to go to the examination council and ask why Alice in particular would not sit for exams . The thought of repeating the whole year ... Can you imagine ? At the same time I would think about my life and finally I decided it impossible . At first going to school was very hard for me . I borrowed 1500Rfw from a fellow student . I told her that if all goes well I would pay her very soon . I did n't know where to get that money but I took it because I needed bus fare .
Ubwo ndaza jya hariya kuri conseil ejo ndagenda mbabwira mbese ikibazo cyanjye ko ari cyo kibazo mfite , bemera kuvuga ngo bazagira .

Urumva , ukareba ugasanga rero , mba numva na vacance zitanabaho . ||| Then I went to the examination council yesterday and explained to them my problem . At the council they easily understood my problem . They gave a call to my headmaster and reminded him about Alice 's case . They asked him to fill the form on my behalf and take it to the council for me . Then I left that place . In the evening I decided to go and see Claire as I had planned prior . She asked me to go back the next morning that there were some people who wanted to know about life of children who take care of themselves . I told her that I have no problem with that . I know the experience of living alone . I would have left yesterday for school because the headmaster said that I should go back to school . That is what he said on phone . In a word that is how my life is , I am half alive , half dead . From school I do n't expect to find anyone home . I do n't even think having someone visiting me ; let 's say an aunt visiting me , I do n't have any aunt , I do n't have any uncle , no one . As you see me standing here in front of you , I am the oldest person of the family that survived . Because of all that , I wish there were no holidays at all .

Well , when I reached his home , I was never treated like a home child . He took me to be like a housemaid . Every night I would go to hide somewhere in the bush and in the morning , they would pick me up . In his home I would go to harvest coffee . We would take the coffee to the machine for grinding . Sometimes I would go to fetch water for cleaning the coffee . Most of the time , that would be my work in his home . I guess you know that by then it was harvest time . for coffee as well as for other things . They used to give me a lot of work because I was vulnerable . We would spend the whole day in coffee plantations and take it for grinding . From there , I would go for water . I would not use a normal can ; I would use an old can to fetch water and I would bring water with it . I would bring half can water . Not a full one .

The first time I passed there , I was with my mum and she said ; "@ I am going to find means of how we would go to Burundi because there 's no other alternative . @" But as I told you , she stopped on the way . Then I went on and ascended the hill . Then I decided to pass at my uncle 's place expecting to find somebody . When I went there , I found no one . The grass had grown everywhere .

I would aim from where I was standing and look across the hill but I would not find any place that I knew . Believe me , I did not try to commit suicide only once , I did twice . Slightly below that home there was a river . I do n't remember what it was called . Near their home , the river was approximately there [ she 's pointing ] and they were living somewhere like here [ as she 's pointing ] . Near the swamp . Then I said to myself ; "@ I am going to throw myself in this river . @" I threw myself in the river and simply drunk some water and found myself the other side of the river . When I was young , I used to hear that when you commit suicide and you have money , you can never die . I had 1000Rfw in my pocket . "@ Maybe it is the reason why I can not die . @" I thought . Then I put that money aside and then went back into the river . I still did not die . Then I left the river . That is how I left that man 's home . He was called Kayigamba .

I heard that Abiya who was a doctor is now in Kenya . That is what rumours say . He went with a girl called Grace . Grace was a girl we were hiding together in that home . He used to say that he was trying to save her and later make her his wife . Then they went together but I have n't heard more about them .

Is n't it ? I knew I would one day leave the orphanage . Otherwise there were n't many problems . However , for me to decide to leave the orphanage , there was a certain man who was called ... I do n't remember his name . He was some kind of director . One day ... I had a big scar here on my ankle , where I was speared . Then he would ... by then I was too slim ; I looked very weak . Then he said to me , "@ look at this disaster ! @"@ . The director , said that . Otherwise , I was fine and I was with other children . I could eat , sleep , you know , we would get all things plus clothes .
Ariko jyewe nza kugira ikibazo cy' uwo mugabo bajya bita ngo ni Kayigamba . Ubwo ndangije nyine nibwo nagize gute ? Ndesida ( mfata icyemezo ) jyewe gusezera nyine .

Then I decided to leave the orphanage . I told them that I wanted to leave the orphanage . I said I would live the way God wished . I preferred working for someone as a housemaid to being abused by someone . I think by then I had completed my primary studies . Then I left the orphanage .

But for sure when I came out of the orphanage , we never took an immediate decision of going there ... well , there was a certain man by the names of Gahigi Esile , he told us that he knew our family . [ I had just came out of the orphanage . ] He said ; "@ I used to know your parents , in fact your father was my good friend . Do n't worry , come home I will take care of you like my own children . @" The three of us went to his home ; I told him that if he took me alone it would n't be of any help to me , because these are the only relatives I survived with . Therefore , he took us all . We went to his place . At his place we lived there with no problem . But later his wife became a problem to us . His wife told him that , " I can not handle the kids you brought ; they are disobedient , they are ... name it . @"

He called me and asked me what was the matter . I told him that it seems to be impossible for me to stay here . But he rejected the idea .

That he did n't have money to buy books . Some other time another event happened ; he had other two girls that he had brought ... he used to work from Kigali ; he was a businessman there in the commercial street . But he would come home on Fridays . He took his daughters to the tailor and made them good clothes then for us he bought us very funny clothes . He put those clothes in the closet and called me . He said to me , "@ look into that closet there are some clothes , check if they suit your cousins and you . @"

Meanwhile I said bye to the other man . By then I was in secondary one . Then we started living alone and he started saying that we got spoiled . I said no problem , watch us and see if we would ever mess up on the streets . We lived there and never stepped in his home . But I am sure he never saw us in very bad conditions ; we never got sick of jigger . We sometimes used to get soap and wash our clothes . He never caught us looking bad .

When one intentionally decides to skip dinner , they find it easy but when one misses it simply because there is no food , it is very distressing . The kids ask me @: Alice what should we do ? Yet , I myself have no choice . So I also ask them , "@ You are now mature , why do n't you tell me what to do ? Look !

Therefore , I believe God knows us and He is watching . Instead of telling a son of man who will not help me and who may even laugh at me , I just keep silent . There is a time I reach my worst moments where I think about working as a housemaid for someone because I do n't think there is any other job that I can get . But later , when I think about waking up at 5:00am and all those struggles , I say no ! I can not work as a house girl yet we used to have them at home . I think about such things when life has become very hard on me .

Ibintu bingoye mu buzima ? Mbese muby' ukuri , ibyo kuvuga ngo ... wenda...tuvuge nanjye mba ndi umwana urerwa . Sibyo ? Ntabwo mba bazwa umunyu , cyangwa se isabune cyangwa n' ikindi icyo aricyo cyose . Njyewe ku bwanjye iyo mbirebye , mba mfite uburyo mbese mbyitwaramo ubundi . Mba mfite uburyo mbyitwaramo , nkamenya wenda njya ntekereza gutya jyewe njya nkunda gutekereza cyane hari n' igihe ndara ntanasinziriye , ngasinzirira mbese nka mu gitondo , bikarara birwaniramo ngatekereza cyane narangiza nkagira gute ? Ariko nkagira wa mutima mbese , nkagira umutima mbese ngira , umuntu agira ahari imitima 2 simbizi , urebye . Hari umubwira ati @: kora iki , hari umubwira ati @: iki kireke , urumva ? Narangiza nkagira gute ? Nkumva ... sinzi , mbese nkabyihorera nkabyiyibagiza , kuko nihaye gutekereza cyane havamo ikinti ikindi kibazo . Kandi ugasanga bagize gute ? Kuko uba utinya n' abantu bo hanze . Kugira ngo bazanseka , bazagira gute , wowe ukagira gute ? Ukagira umutima nama mbese ubamo , ubundi ukicecekera ukituriza . Njyewe n' uko mbona mbayeho . ||| My major problems ... well at my age , I am supposed to be having someone to care for me . I am not supposed to be asked about the salt at home , soap or anything else . So , when I see all that ... any way I have a way I bare with it . Sometimes when I have so much problems I fail to get sleep and spend the whole night awake and maybe sleep in the morning . Sometimes I have wondered if a person has two hearts because , there 's always a voice that consoles me telling me do this instead of that . If it was n't that , I would have done something wrong that would give me more problems . And I do not want to become the talk of town , people would laugh at me which I basically avoid . Therefore I keep quiet and see days passing .
Urumva ikikugoye , wambwiye uti @: kurya birakugora , icyo nicya mbere . Nta kindi wakongeraho ? ||| What else is a challenge to you ? You told me that getting food is the first problem . Do n't you have any other problem ?
Mbese urebye , ku , mbese , icyo kimibereho kiratugoye , ari ikibazo cy' imyigire nacyo kiratugoye . Uti se gute ? Nagusobanurira impamvu . Uzahaguruka ujye ku ishuri , iwanyu musaza wawe cyangwa mukuru wawe azaba yagupangiye . Urumva ? Ariko nkanjye Alisa , ndabunza imitima . Ndagiye ngiye ku ishuri , ntwaye n' akantu kadafashije , urumva ? Nonehonjyewe ndagenda nka ... njyewe nko ku ishuri rwose bikunze kungora cyane , urumva ? Noneho ngira gutya nkajya mu ishuri ; nk' abandi bana tukiga , twamara kwiga ariko ugasanga bo bishimiye gutaha . Ariko njyewe ho ngira gute ? Mba nibaza ukuntu tuzataha noneho nkibaza n' uburyo tugiye gute ? Kubaho noneho . Noneho nkavuga se nti ubuse ko ndi hano , icyambere cyo nta cumbi tugira nk' abandi , urumva ? Ngo tuvuge wenda ngo dufite inzu yacu bwite , n' ukugenda ducumbika . Ubwo mbese ugasanga n' iki ? Ni ibibazo . Yee , nkajye nkibaza nkanjye rero mukuru nkabireba , nkasanga noneho biri ku ntusha nkabura ukuntu mbigenza . ||| Well , getting food is very hard but still , even going to school is another problem . One can ask "@ how ? @" Let me explain . One can go to school because the brother or sister prepared something for him or her but poor Alice , I simply go without sufficiant school material . Well , like other students I go to class but my heart is ever wondering , "@ After school how will we go home and what will we find there @" while others are happy to go home . First of all , we do n't have a house , it is just going round asking for shelter and many other problems . Especially me as the oldest , it affects me so much yet I have nothing to do .
Noneho ukurikije ibyo bibazo byose ufite , wumva hari ubwiyunge bushobora kwiyunga n' abagiye bateye ibi bibazo byose , ndavuga mbese bariya bicanyi batwaye ababyeyi bawe , bagatuma uba résponsable w' ibintu , wumva ushobora kubyihanganira ukiyunga nabo ? ||| Given all your problems . Do you find it possible to reconciliate with those who caused them to you ? I mean the killers who murdered your parents and caused you all these responsibllities at an early age .
Jyewe rero icyo kibazo cy' ubwiyunge , nk' umuntu koko , waba uzi yuko yaba yarakoze icyo cyaha . Wenda tuvuge jyewe nk' uwaza akavuga ati @: jyewe nishe so , nishe nyoko cyangwa nica n' abo muvukana . Jyewe mu by' ukuri aje kunsaba imbabazi kandi yitwa ko azikuye ku mutima , urumva ? Jyewe imbabazi nagira gute ? Jyewe nazimuha . Ariko mu by' ukuri , nk' uko nguko , wenda tuvuge ntawe nzi ; njyewe narangije kumubabarira kera . Urumva ? Kuko , wenda nta n' ukiriho cyangwa n' ugize . Ntiwambaza jye uwabishe ngo mukubwire , simbazi , singize gute . Ariko kuko njya mbabona abahe ? Abo mumuryango gutya , urumva ? Bakabivuga , nk' ubu urugero ntanga , nk' uwishe se w' abo bana tuvukana kwa Data wacu , yaraje arampamagara . ||| On my behalf , the question of reconciliation ... well if there is a person who committed that crime , for example @: if someone came to me and told me that they killed my mom and dad and others frankly speaking , I can forgive them . In fact , I already forgave the one who killed them yet I do n't know him . If one asked me who it was , I would n't be able to tell because I did n't know him . Maybe he died who knows ! But there are some of the families I see for example @: the person who killed my uncle @: the my cousins ' father , the ones we are living together . He came and called me ...
Amaze kumpamagara noneho , kuko jyewe n' ibyo gushinja sinigeze , mbese wabonaga nta n' ikintu binambwiye njyewe . Kuko icyo gihe njyewe nabonaga wapi , nkabona ari uguta igihe . Urumva ? Yarampamagaye arambaza @: « ese Alice ko ari wowe mukuru , ibintu bimeze gutya » . We aranyihamagarira jyewe njya aho afungiye . Naramubwiye nti @: muby' ukuri , nti yego nanjye wankoreye icyaha , ariko ntabwo ari njyewe ugomba kukubabarira , mbere y' abo wiciye ababyeyi babo . Ba aribo uhamagara , we kuba ari jye ugira gute ? Uhamagara ngo ninze mbe natanga imbabazi cyangwa nagira gute . Noneho kubera ko duturanye , noneho umugore niwe waje arabimbwira . Ndangije naramubwiye nti @: ariko ndumva ibyo ngibyo njyewe bidashoboka . Nti urumva ? Nti njyewe nadecida ( nafata icyemezo ) ari uko barumuna banjye nabo bagize icyo bavuga . Urumva ? Ubwo bahamagaye umukuru , umukuru aravuga ati , ntabwo bishoboka . Urumva ? Jyewe urumva ko ntari kumubabarira kandi n' abandi bagize gute ? Abo yakoreye icyaha bari ahongaho . ||| When he called me...because I never used to get involved in the witnessing business , I used to find it waste of time . Therefore he asked me ; "@ Alice ! You are the oldest , can n't you forgive me ? @" I replied that , "@ it is true you did bad to me too , but I am not the one to forgive you . His children are there , call them , and ask them to forgive you . Because we are neighbours , his wife came to me and told me the same story but I told her "@ I do n't think that is possible . I can only decide after my cousins have said something about it @"@ . They ended up talking to the oldest but she refused . Then there was no way I could forgive him yet those he had hurt did not .
Jyewe umuntu wankoreye icyaha , aje akansaba imbabazi , kandi azikuye ku mutima , namubabarira . Ariko mugihe ntawe nzi , ndi hagati . Ese , namubabarira , nabigenza gute ? Ariko jyewe muzi , yansaba imbabazi akazihabwa cyangwa se atazisaba agakomeza agahanwa . Kuko ubundi bajya bavuga ngo ubundi "@ uwicishijwe icyuma nawe agomba kwicishwa ikindi @"@ . Sibyo ? Iki gihe ababyeyi banjye baba bakiriho wenda banagize . Ariko nawe , kuko ntavuga ngo bagende bamwice n' ubundi ntabwo biriho , namubabarira . ||| But if a person who committed a crime against me asked me to forgive him when he is really sorry , I can forgive him , but since I do n't know him , my heart is divided on the issue . Tell me ! What would you do ? Would you forgive him or ... Sincerely if I knew him and he was ready to ask for forgiveness , I would forgive him . And if he were not ready to ask for forgiveness , then he would continue to serve his sentence . Normally it is a said that ; he who killed using a sword should die by the sword , but since that saying was not obeyed then I can just forgive him .
Ubundi se , nagira ngo nkubaze akandi kabazo . Ubona , ni iyihe nama , urabona y' uko , ufite ikibazo , yego n' ubwo ugifite kandi gikomeye , ariko nka babandi muba muri kumwe nabo , urabizi nka hariya mu bana ba PNUD nabo bahura n' ibyo bibazo bikomeye , abo muhuje ibibazo ni benshi , ibyo ari byo byose nkamwe mufite icyo kibazo cyo kuba murera imfubyi kandi namwe murizo mufite imyaka mikeya , mukiri aba mineur . Ibyo aribyo byose hari ubuzima uzi wumva ndetse n' ukuntu ugenda ubwigobotora ubwigobotora , ni iyihe nama waha abantu bafite nk' ibyo bibazo ? ||| I would like to ask you another question @: what advice can you give to ... well , it is true you have a very big problem in fact a heavy one however , there are children who have the same problem as you and they are many . You who have the problem of looking after orphans yet you are also an orphan , there is a kind of life you know and you know how to survive through it . What kind of advise can you give to people with such problems ?
Nk' abana b' imfubyi bibana ? Cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese waba wumva afite ikibazo ? ||| Are you talking about orphans or any other people who have such problems ?
Nk' abana b' imfubyi bibana , ni nk' iyihe nama wabagira kugira ngo barebe ukuntu bagenda bigobotora amagorane n' imisaraba barimo ? ||| Orphans . What advice can you give them , so that they can be able to lighten the cross they are bearing ?
Mbese ubundi jyewe , icyo nagira inama mbese nk' abana b' imfubyi mbese birera cyane cyane , ababyeyi babo bazize itsembatsemba n' itsembabwoko , icyo nababwira cyo . Mbere na mbere bazajye babanza banyurwe . Sibyo ? Bazajye babanza banyurwe . Noneho wumve yuko ubuzima urimo bugushimishije , ntibuba ari bwiza , ariko mbese wumve unyuzwe n' ukuri . Urumva ? Utwo ufite twose wumve unyuzwe . Kandi wumve y' uko ufite umutima mwiza mbese , wumve ko utwo tukunyuze , wumve y' uko ibyo bintu byo hanze bitaguhangayitse bitagize gute , wowe ukagira gute ? Wowe ukareba imbere gusa . ||| The kind of advice I can give to orphans who are taking care of themselves , due to the loos of their parents during the genocide is @: first of all they should be appreciative . They should be happy with the kind of life they are leading , I know is it not the best life but they should have a positive attitude and never mind a lot about the worldly pleasures . They should focus on what is ahead .
Ukavuga tuvuge nkanjye ndi umunyeshuri , nyuzwe y' uko ndi umunyeshuri , nkanyurwa y' uko nanaburaye.kuko iyo nza kuba ntanyuzwe wenda n' uko ndi cyangwa n' iki ? Abana benshi murabizi , bajya mu muhanda bakagenda bakiyandarika bakagira gute . Kubera iki ? Ntabwo baba banyuzwe . Baravuga bati njyewe ndi mpfubyi , urumva , ntawe ngira mbwira noneho reka njyewe ngire gute , ngende jye kwiyandarika . Ugasanga aragiye ariyandaritse ntanyuzwe n' uko ari , akuyemo n' iki ? Akuyemo na SIDA . Kuri iki gihe noneho uzi yuko nicyo cyorezo noneho cyateye . Ariko uyo unyuzwe ukanyura n' ukuri ukanyurwa n' ubuzima bwawe , kuko byose byose biza buhoro . ||| For example @: I am a student , I have to be happy with being a student and be happy even though I had nothing to eat for dinner . If I was not contented with what I have ... I believe you know what most children do ? They get to the streets and misbehave , why ? Because they are not happy with what they have , they say ; "@ I am an orphan who has no one to listen to my problems @" so , they go to the streets and involve themselves in prostitution and end up getting infected with HIV @/@ AIDS which in now an epidemic . But if you are happy with the little you have and are content with who you are , the rest will come slowly .
Mu rwego rwo kwanzura , wumva icyagirira abanyarwanda , kuko urabona y' uko ubuhamya bwawe buzabikwa twakubwiye ko buzajyanwa muri Archive National . Buzabikwa uzabureba nunagira amahirwe yo kuzagira abana , n' abana bawe baburebe n' abo urera baburebe , bumve inama n' impanuro ubahaye , ukurikije ibyo wanyuzemo n' inyigisho mbese wagiye ukuramo nawe kuburyo byatumye nawe utanga inama zihagije . Wumva hari ikindi kintu wakongeraho , gishobora kuzagirira akamaro ku bazabureba ? ||| What advise can you give to your fellow Rwandans since , as you can see , your testimony will be kept ? Remember that we said we are going to keep your testimony in the "@ National Archive @" It will be well kept and you will see it . If you are lucky to one day have kids , they will be able to see it , plus those you are looking after . All will be able to listen to your advice , which , you have given based on your lifetime experience . What other advice can you give that will be of help to those who will listen to your testimony ?
Cyagirira mbese...mbese ubundi njyewe icyo nakongeraho . Mu by' ukuri n' uko abanyarwanda twese mbese dushyize hamwe . Ni uko twareba ukuntu génocide itazongera kugaruka mbese mu Rwanda . Tugashyira hamwe mbese tugashakisha nk' urukundo hagati yacu , tugakundana , twarangiza mbese urareba mbese intambara zikunze kugenda ziza , abacengezi , cyangwa iki ? Ariko murareba ko byatangiye kugenda bigira gute ? Byoroha . Ariko muby' ukuri , ndebye mbona amahoro nta kibazo . Ubungubu , ikibazo twebwe ubundi tuba twifitiye , jyewe nkanjye , nkanjye Alisa , cyangwa nk' abandi , ikibazo umuntu afite muri iki gihe tugezemo n' ikimibereho mbese twebwe , ubundi ibyo kuvuga ngo intambara izaba , umuntu ajya kuvuga ngo niyo ntambara izaba , ariko yagize gute ? Ariko yahaze , yagize gute . Nkanjye Alisa niba izajya ku , njyewe se nabibwirwa n' iki se ? Mba nibereye ku kibazo cy' imibereho nyine . ||| Well , if all Rwandans were united , we could find a way to prevent Genocide from happening again in Rwanda . We should be united and love one another . I believe you have noticed how wars have been intervening but lucky enough they are stopping . In fact there is peace and security . The main problem I have or even others encounter nowadays is the problem of surviving . Those who are well off spread rumours of wars . But poor Alice how can I know about such things yet I am struggling for something to eat for a day ?
Ariko mu by' ukuri numva nk' abanyarwanda bashyize hamwe baba bajijutse mbese bitwa ko badukuriye , badukuriye . Bareba ukuntu mbese iyi ntambara itazongera ngo igaruke mbese tukiberaho mu bukene bwacu no mu bupfubyi bwacu , wenda Uwiteka yazagira gute ? Yazatwibuka . Ariko icyo ngicyo cyo kuvuga ngo intambara , rwose bagashakisha uburyo byava mu bantu , yego ntabwo umuntu yakwibagirwa ko ibyo byabayeho , ariko ibyo gutekereza gutegura izindi ntambara mbese bikajyenda bivamo mbese mu banyarwanda hose bikavamo . ||| However I request the wise and older men of Rwanda to find a way of preventing such wars from happening again . It 's ok to stay in our poverty and remain orphans ; maybe God will remember us . But as far as the war is concerned , they should find a way of convincing people to abandon those thoughts , of course it is not easy to forget what happened but still they should n't organise other wars and that thought should clear out all Rwandans .
Urumva nta kindi wakongeraho ? ||| Anything else you would like to add ?
Ndumva nta kindi . ||| I believe there is nothing more .
