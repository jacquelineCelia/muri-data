I remember my dad saying , "@ It is over now . @" They were saying we should flee to E.T.O in Kicuciro because it was the only place where people could hide ; a neighbour would n't hide you , ever .

So we went out suddenly we were surrounded by the Interahamwe , They took my brother with other people and killed them after that they left them there . They knew my brother , they said to him @: 'we are going to kill you first and finish your sister after @"@ . They killed others first and came to him after , they hacked him ; they put him in front of everyone and hacked him while everyone was laughing at him . They left him there . They took the metal tank they had with them and went to fetch water in the swamp . They had a metal tank , a water tank and casseroles that they stole in several places . After fetching water , they searched for fire woods to cook with . They said to me @: ‘ think the way we are going to kill you brother , it is going to be awful for you ’ . They heated the water that was in The tank up to the boiling point , after boiling , his brother was still breathing a little bit so they carried him and put him in the boiling water and closed it . They tried to increase the heat after he was thrown in the tank . They took shaped woods and started to press his head saying his head is getting out but the truth was that he was tall and could not fit in it .

I watched them going to their homes but I can n't tell what time it was by then . However , it was around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m , about the time you hear small creatures murmuring . The time when everything is asleep , the time when even frogs can not croak .

I was trying to go where I had left the others in the bush where we used to meet . But meanwhile I saw something very bright and it was at night ... I do n't know ... Many people said they saw it as well . It was very big shaped like a snake . It passed through the sky leaving every part of the sky very bright . Then I thought that I had once again been found out . I ran and ran until I reached the place where I had left the rest . They almost ran but I whispered to them that it was I. They asked me about the boy that we went with ; I told them that he was dead . We sat down we could not sleep because we were always ready to be attacked . We would simply doze .

They said @: "@ Do n't worry , write down your names we will pick you up tomorrow . @" The next day on the 16th they did not come .

We went and spent the night at the school . We used to spend the night there , and during the day we would go loitering in the swamps but we had never slept there because the Interahamwe used to go home at around 4 o'clock and we would go behind them and go back to the school .

Even the others went back to their jobs ; the place suddenly became very silent , you could not even hear a bird singing . Then I came out of the millet plantation and ran . I run , run and run . I increased the speed thinking that someone was behind me . I could not even feel pain because the wounds were still fresh . I was about to reach Nyamata , but again I changed my mind because I feared some Interahamwe who had been patrolling that night . I returned to the swamp but I was too thirsty . I drank a lot of muddy water until my stomach was full .

Today , we have the Funds of Assistance to Genocide Survivors , Fonds d' Assistance aux Rescapés du Génocide ( FARG ) in French . It helps in paying survivors ' school fees . Survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from . I am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness . There are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today . The Government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... I think it 's good .

You can not take an old man and it happens that he judges his son , this is a rare case . The probability that it happens is one percent out of ninety nine percent . If it happens , the judgment will be dropped . I endorse the fact that Gacaca justice is there . There is no other choice , the number of people is big and the capacity of the country is small so the Gacaca courts are there as a quick solution .

Those small hammers were used on us on specific days , that is one thing that hurt most during the genocide , if only people were to be killed without being mocked and tortured ; they always gave us dates to die , if I remember well , they once said , today is the 19th , on the 20th no more Tutsi 's will be living

Ibyo nabyo numva atari igihano , numva ubwo butabera ntazi ubwo ari bwo , sindatekereza ubwo ari bwo ngo numve ndenganuwe . ||| Justice ? Since I do not even know where the person who killed my family is ; maybe he is somewhere in jail ... to me , it is like nothing has been done as far as justice is concerned . When you see someone who killed your family members being condemned for something like five years , you know that , sooner or later , the five years will be over and then he will be released . Being imprisoned is a punishment yes , but personally justice has not yet come my way because I have never seen it . They have never judged the people who killed my family , so that I maybe say that they were condemned to death or to life imprisonment . Therefore , I do n't consider that as a punishment , actually I wonder which type of justice that is . Neither have I ever analysed it to see if it [ justice ] has been done to me .

Icyo kintu numva nkibuka cyane , kandi nkumva kirambabaje . ||| The one thing I keep remembering is the way they 'd get people from their hiding places and run after them with dogs . I remember a certain man called Canisius , he had many dogs that were used in hunting people from the bushes where they were hiding . Once they caught them , you 'd hear screams that meant they had been killed . They run after them as though they were animals , Tutsis were no longer human beings then . I remember how Tutsis were denied their rights as human beings . They had become like animals and they started killing Tutsis as they believed they were not human beings . They believed they were killing something else , not human beings . I remember that thing so well and it hurts me .

The fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not Rwandese and killing Rwandans meant nothing to him .

About that question ... do you mean Rwandan journalists or foreign ones ? About that question ... About that question ... from 1992...from 1994 ... If you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people . All of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living . However if you read the book le droit de vivre by Hibert , you can see that book shows well that Hotel de Mille Collines was protected by Gendarmes according to the investigations . That is why people did not die there . That is what the book says

That was in a place called Mwendo in Kibuye . They took us up to the roadblock and asked us if we were Tutsis and we said we were not but they looked at us and told us we must be Tutsis because of our soft hair and all . They said many things and told us to stop lying to them . They asked me to dig up my own grave and I refused which shows that I had reached a point where I was no longer afraid . We were taken to the commune . They said the borgamster would be the one to judge our case . We ended up spending one night in a cell as we found when the borgmaster was drunk . But I was n't afraid anymore at that time . All my fears died up after my parents were murdered and after seeing so many dead bodies on the way .

Then she told me that despite the fact that she had promised Hélène to hide me earlier but she was not going to be able to as things had become really bad . She told me she was hiding many people in her home but she was n't sure they 'd still be alive the next day . I do n't know why despite all that I remained assured that I was going to survive . Bibi [ Mémé en Swahili ] then told me to leave her home . I told Mama Sania @: "@ Mama , have mercy on me and hide me please ! @" She refused and said I should leave . When she said so , I felt like it was over and I was going to die . But I was mostly sad that I was going to die without saying goodbye to my father and without asking Edouard to forgive me . I cried and then she asked me to come back . I was crying so much as I was leaving that she asked me to come back . She told me she was a Muslim , she believed in God and if she let me go and I got killed on the way , she believed God would ask her to give an account about me . She took me inside to a room inside her house and when I got in , I felt like the situation was hopeless ... I had been thinking that I was the only Tutsi that was still alive in Rwanda and then I found all these people who were hiding in that room . They were so many ! The one I always remember is a girl who was there . She never talked to me . They had really destroyed her , she had been raped and done her really bad things . There 's no other way to put it , she was rotten . She was bleeding daily . I tried talking to her in a way to reassure her that we were going to survive but she never used to reply . She had become numb . I prayed all the prayers I could think of asking God to heal her but ... she was in so much pain and she could n't eat . The old lady tried her best to help us but it was n't possible .

She asked me to go back the next morning that there were some people who wanted to know about life of children who take care of themselves . I told her that I have no problem with that . I know the experience of living alone . I would have left yesterday for school because the headmaster said that I should go back to school . That is what he said on phone . In a word that is how my life is , I am half alive , half dead . From school I do n't expect to find anyone home . I do n't even think having someone visiting me ; let 's say an aunt visiting me , I do n't have any aunt , I do n't have any uncle , no one .

They pointed them at me ; I was sited somewhere here I said all that is nothing ! They left their guns here and there and the others came , I went up there with a girl called Bebe we went to fetch water and the Inkotanyi came and said @: ‘ hey ? ’ I said ‘ yes ' ‘ Why are you fleeing ? ’ I said , ‘ fleeing from what ? ’ ‘ Fleeing from the Inkotanyi ? ’ I said that I was also Inkotanyi ’ ! ‘ If you want you can tell I am also Inkotanyi I said that there is no Inkotanyi that is greater than me , they said but you 're an old woman , I am an old woman ? So if you have you mother and you 're an Inkotanyi she also one . So they came in and brought everyone out said hello that was it .

You added that you would kill even a Hutu who refused to bring them uphill .

They fought at the border , they were pushed back the first time in 1990 , and then there came agents . Every Tutsi was called an agent and some would be put together over there in Nyamirambo , you can see that all this contributed to the eruption of the Genocide . I can remember a priest who once found me in Kinshasa , I do n't remember the year but it was before genocide and after 1990 , he told me that , tell your relative , s as if they are under my control , not to attack because if they do , no single Tutsi will be found in Rwanda , so I said that those who are out of the country should stop trying to come back home so that the ones who decided to stay in the country will not get killed .

After two months , she left the country because she had a husband who was a student in Makerere University in Uganda . So she went to see her husband . I was left alone with the child and she said to me @: ‘ There is nothing I can do , I have to go and I can not take you with me because I do n't know where to take you . @" She said to me again @: ‘ You can not handle the life out there , so try your best to live . @" The only thing she left me was a mat to rest on . I stayed there ; I started to struggle with my child . I could stay in the house desperate ; I could spend the whole day and night without eating . The next day , if I meet a good person and he or she gives me food . Perhaps the following day I do n't find someone . My child could get ill , if it happens I get a job I take care of my child . Later I suffered the kind of headache I suffered in 1996 , I started bleeding in the nose but it was somehow different from before , though I was bleeding so much . I started to lose weight every single day ; day and night I was losing weight . I said to myself what if I am HIV positive and my tests came negative . I do n't believe I am alright . I went on with other tests in order to be aware of how I am doing physically , I found out I was alright . I continued to lose weight ; I lost weight every single day . I did not stop calming myself though I was like that . I had 85 kilograms before ; I lost almost 33 kilograms in that sorrowful life . Up to now , I live alone and I feel lonely . Whenever a day passes , I thank God the way I live with friends and good people who understand me and my life . I wonder how I am going to return to school . This is a problem I face up to this moment .

We heard them talking in the bedroom [ our parents ] they woke us up and said , "@ Wake @-@ up , things are not good . @" They tunned on the foreign news and heard it being said in both French and English . Then we asked them what was taking place , they told us not to worry , but bad things were likely to happen in this country . In the morning we heard that our neighbour had been killed . Then mum sent us to a certain person who was selling ... in the neighbourhood , he was also a Tutsi . She told us to go and tell him that he should close his shop because things had deteriorated . He was running a bar . And on our way as we were going to tell him , we met people going to kill others . We ran back home and never said anything . That was when the war had really started ; people started to kill . At home they came to kill on the 12th . They first protected us ; some people were willing to protect us . "@ Nothing will happen to you @"@ , they promised . But people from different areas were saying that if our family was still alive , then no Tutsi was dead , then the Inyenzi were still alive .

They would come from other sectors to hunt us or rather to ‘ work ’ as they called it . We could keep on running the whole day , hiding from Interahamwe . Whenever they would come to attack us , they would shout saying , "@ Surround them , and search for them @"@ . They were also afraid of us because they knew they could find someone with a machete who could kill them . We had a system , when we could hear their noise we would hide , pass behind them and go where they were coming from .

We would get scattered , but after a chase we knew where we would meet , in a certain bush , which we had transformed into our house .

I would never commit such a sin . @" "@ But you already committed it , because you killed others . But now I am begging you to do it for me . @" I said to him . then he said that instead of killing you , "@ let me show you . @" But I told him that , "@ wherever you may take me , it would be the worst death for me .

And all those people were killed by their fellow Rwandans . Which was done in broad daylight . I believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the Rwandans . Therefore I believe that Rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ Rwandans ] . So , I am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it . Because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . People were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open . Therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth . To the genocide survivors I would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible . Which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history . In the past , Rwandans used to be kind . Therefore , I am kindly asking Rwandans to be strong and forgive us .

It is sad when you know that someone used to killed people , I was always hurt whenever I could see Munyakazi getting promoted in army ranks when he never stopped to come and take people from Saint Paul and Ste Famille . Okay it 's good now he was sent to prison but there are other people like him . They should stop them to work because as they get the kind of jobs they try to hide necessary information . Let 's say if I was a colonel , I would just go and tell someone to leave me alone and to not say anything . They intimidate officials like the ones in the court and they give them respect because of who they are . Those courts respect them for who they are and they can not step forward and arrest them but even though it was an ordinary citizen...they will get killed as well . They should also take them as ordinary citizen and get arrested . The funny thing is that in court they call them "@ Your Honor @" during the time of judgment , how can you judge a man you have already respected that way .

Should be punished in public where everybody will be seeing in order to frighten those who have the same plans . Because they will know that , if they do the same thing , they will be treated in the same way . Therefore , if they stop that habit [ not punishing ] the country will be built and will become pleasing . Therefore , in order for our contry to be pleasing , the young ones will have to continue in the line of development ; they will have to finish their studies and improve our contry . First of all , they have to know that the killers still have the intentions of killing . Therefore , they have to first sencitize them and teach them that , they have to live with others peacefully without killing . Fir example those people in Gikongoro whom they sentenced to death . I hope they will shut them in open . And I believe that , if they do it in public , I guess in Gikongoro there will be no more killings . Because no one can see his fellow being shot on a tree and then he goes a head with his wrong plans that would take him to the same tree . Therefore , eliminating the habit of ont punishing is the best . If they do so , our country will develop . Because those are one of the things that distablise genocide survivors . Because when we had about what took place in Gikongoro , we were all afraid . We thought the same thing would happen to us ...

No justice has been done so far ! In my opinion , not yet and I believe even others feel the same way . Because what justice can be done to somebody who wiped out your children , all your family ? What do you gain when they are imprisoned for five , or six or ten years ? What punishment is that ? Justice will be done according to the laws of the country , but many will never be known and that is a very big issue because many have fled from where their former residence . They now live in places where they are not known . Or maybe they are known but nobody has the courage to report them for fear that they might take revenge afterwards . It is a very big issue in Rwanda . It will be very difficult unless they ask for forgiveness and confess their sin and acknowledge them .

We are in Kicukiro , in Sahara sector , the cell is Niboye II . Many people were killed here , over 500 people . Those who were on the other side were killed on April 10th , 1994 . Among them are my mother and my older sister . The ones who are in here were killed on April 14th , 1994 . The killers had machetes , guns , grenades , swords . They slaughtered them and some of them were burnt alive .

Even people from other sectors would go there and dance and drink and then later they would go home . Me too , I would go there to dance because I used to like it . Although I would go to dance , I could see that some people in my family were not happy with it . I would sense something but it would be so unclear to me . Later in ... 1993 when I really knew what political parties were . The year was ending , I remember I was in primary three and that is when I quit school . I just stopped studying . I remember there was a war but the war had n't reached our area . We used to hear that there is a war in Ruhengeri and Byumba .

It was on the 15th of April 1994 . The group of attackers came in many buses . Sometimes they used to come and when they were pushed back , they would go back saying that the Inyenzi were in the swamp and that they had guns . Actually two of Habyarimana 's soldiers [ the Presidential Guard ] had come to kill us and two of the resistors took their guns and used them to defend themselves . Whenever the Interahamwe came towards the swamp they would hear the guns and then they would say there are Inyenzi in the swamps . So they went and called for the buses . You remember the attack of Nyanza ? The buses , which came are the one that came to kill in Bugesera . That was the day I was hacked . When those buses reached Nyanza , they found that they [ the other Interahamwe ] were killing people . Therefore they said , " Keep on finishing the ones ; we are going to reinforce the Bugesera people . The buses came straight to the school building where we were hiding , they really killed many people only few were left . But for us who were near the swamp , that is where they found us . Some old people committed suicide saying that they survived the machetes of 1959 and that the machetes of 1994 could not kill them . They dived into the water and were taken away . People who committed suicide were more than those who were hacked . Others said , "@ Let us die like men . Committing suicide is a sin @"@ . One would say , "@ lets me go and hide . @"

Even then we migrated while they were seizing and eating our cattle , burning our houses and still it was the Hutus killing the Tutsis . They demolished the tutsi 's houses . Then other things that I remember well are the events of 1973 because then I was a wench . Still it was the Hutu killing the Tutsi . They demolished Tutsi 's houses and killed them . Some Tutsis fled . That time we fled to Kamonyi church in Gitarama [ in kamonyi district ] . Then they [ Hutus ] said that the war should stop .

She was selling clothes ; she would come these ends of Nyabugogo to buy clothes on wholesale and sell them in Kibuye . My aunt lived in Muhima and sometimes she would come ... and they knew each other . So one time they met from Nyabugogo . That lady who used to buy clothes from Nyabugogo knew that my sister survived . My sister was living in some home where she had gone ... she met some people who were at the stream harvesting sweet potatoes . That woman was a Tutsi ... she took her home and my sister told her all about her . Then that lady hid my sister in the house but her husband was not aware . Until September that is when we met . As she got out we immediately saw each other . But her husband never knew about it . It was a very big house and therefore , she hid her somewhere in the house and warned her elder children that , "@ nobody should ever open this room . @" And even her husband would never come to the room ; he used to go and come back deep in the night . He would come going to bed directly . Whenever she would want to go to the toilets , that woman would send the kids somewhere and obviously the man would n't be around . Therefore , she would go to the toilets and then come in quickly . She stayed in the house all the time . No other person knew that my sister was in their house except her elder son and daughter plus her . Only the elder children .

He saved me ; I am sure that Interahamwe was going to kill me . When I run to Yahaya 's house while fleeing , he welcomed me into his house and stand by my side . And I did n't have many people sided with me then . That 's why I think he was a good man , a righteous man . He did it not even so much because he is a Hutu . He told that Interahamwe that he will answer to God the blood he had shed there the previous day and mine as well . So he did n't even do it in the name of being a Hutu but he did it for God . I think he was a righteous man .

We left that place and went to some place beyond Kinazi . There was a forest called Nyabusunzu . That time many Tutsis gathered there because most of their houses were burnt at the same time . They met there with their cows and their children . Some people [ Tutsi ] went to Bugesera and others went to Sainte @- famille church . In the past , people had been running to church on several occasions unlike in 1994 when people ran there and died from there . Even that time same thing happened and continued like that ; they attacked and killed , hit Tutsis with club , some people died , and others fled to exile . There was no other reason why people [ Tutsis ] went to exile ; they were fleeing from the Hutus , who were menacing them with in the country . There is no time when a Hutu stopped torturing a Tutsi ever since 1959 up to 1994 . It was always the Hutu killing the Tutsi .

We had started getting food , some of us who had gained stamina asked to join the RPF . In brief that is how life went...I even lived in the refugee camp shortly , it is the Nkotanyi members who took me there in Juru . Later they took me to Nyagasambu , where I found several other refugees [ I could call them survivors ] . We stayed there for a while and after I joined the RPF army and I became a soldier . During that time , people were very hostile ; sometimes I wonder and ask myself what had happened to the Hutu . I can not imagine how they were thinking during that period . I wonder where their hearts had gone . Someone reaching a point of getting hold of a machete just to hack his fellow human being ! After the genocide I thought that I would never talk to a Hutu for the rest of my life . I hated the Hutu so badly . I knew they were real enemies . And every time I would see a Hutu , I would almost be traumatized . Whenever I would see a Hutu I would wish them death . In brief , that is how I lived during the war until I survived .

Some say that he chose what was on mode like the Rwandans say ... that is what he did , I can not judge him because I 'm not God . However what I see that is true without deffending only Peraudin , it 's the fact that it happened when they are many priests who were working together with colonialists thinking that if they grant them independence they will expel the colonialists as well as the missionaries , you see that had that ideology in that it was even said at that time and it is written .

They took us to the Kigali Sports Club [ Cercle Sportif de Kigali ] in Rugunga . There 's a woman who was with us whom I 'll always remember . She had a very small baby , about 3 months old . On our way , we met a friend of hers and she begged her to take the baby with her . She refused saying that she could n't take the baby as our last day had come [ the Tutsis ' last day ] . I also remember that Mélanie kept reassuring me all the way . They took us to a place that was kind of flat , the ‘ cercle ’ is actually kind of flat .

In our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by Tutsi , there was no Hutu among them . So these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things . Despite that , the genocide was later on generalized .

He added that everyone should go with his weapon and fight an enemy here in Murambi . I heard him saying it ; we were about 30 from that cell . Other people immediately joined us so the number increased . I know most of the people who were there . When we reached a certain centre called Kabuga , we found an Interahamwe called Nganze who had a gun ; therefore he became our leader . We were about sixty people ; we walked up to Wakato and met our counselor .

During that time , they used to enter people 's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted @: either at night or daytime . They could take any thing they wished from people 's houses and beat anyone they wanted to beat . I remember sometime , it was on the Hory Thursday towards Esther . I was going to church and as I reached just in front , I saw a certain boy who was caught by the presidential guards . It was close to the home of Nsabimana 's sister , this Nsabimana was a soldier and he had another name ; he was called Castar .

I can never forget that I once had sisters just because I do n't see them anymore ! I often see children of their age who used to go to school with them and who are now finishing secondary school . There 's a lot that reminds me of them ! It is simply impossible to forget . We can never forget !

Though it will require them a lot of time . It seems too impossible to achieve their goals in a short time . Because , it is astonishing how those who perticipated in the genocide [ Interahamwe malicious ] still have strong hatred and whenever they see you , they try to show you that they still hate you . So , how do you expect reconciliation to take place since he or she , who did those things has more grievance than the one he or she hurt ?

His full names were Aloys Ngirabatware . He was an origin of Gisenyi and closely related to the family of the ex @-@ president ; he had married Mbonabaryi 's daughter . Mbonabaryi Noel was Habyarimana 's ( ex @-@ president ) brother.in.law . He was the head of all the Interahamwe of this area . Additional to that , after the genocide , in his house people found there bags of guns , bullets , corespondance documents , lists of people who were supposed to be killed , lists of Interahamwe ... there were so many things . But people who seized his properties burnt some of the things ; they never knew the value of those things . I just got a few of the information on small papers and the little information I got , was from some body from that home who had gathered them and called me . He told me abiout what took place there and so I rushed for the remaining information and brought it here .

It is difficult to accept that you bring up your children and see them growing , not lacking anything and one day it all goes . It takes some strength to even acknowledge it and accept that it is actually possible . It was something very difficult to believe . Death is normal but it 's a big issue when your family just disappear all at once . It is difficult to even understand it . Sometimes it makes you wonder how God can allow such things to happen but He probably has His own plans that we can not fully understand as human beings . I remember how on the morning before I left , I thought that maybe I was not going to come back since I was going on a journey . So I left a note for my wife telling her where the money was hidden .

In fact , it is like pausing the progress of my life to go though the past . Sometimes I think it affects the body system . I guess that is the testimony I would give to them . To give value to the genocide that took place in Rwanda ! To give value to the survivors and Rwandans in general !

I accepted that gendarmes at saint @-@ Paul center and Sainte @-@ Famille went to fetch water for the displaced people . They even went to bring food for them . Even though these things are not often evoked the priests who were there may tell you that the gendarmes did that work .

However , the government of Rwanda and MRND refused the Agreement of Nsele signed on March 29th 1991 and kept planning the extermination of Tutsis in Rwanda .

Fetching water ... ? @" then she said that , "@ you will be fetching three Jeri cans of water . @" I told her that , "@ that is impossible . @" I would imagine how I never knew how to carry even a small Jeri can , and just conclude that it was the worst death I would ever experience . To me , it worst than the time I was alone without anybody . I would remember that even at home I never did such work . So I told her that , "@ I will never do that work . @" Then she bet , "@ you will do it . @" However the first days I did it ; she would wake me up in the morning while others were sleeping and take me to the stream to fetch water with a big Jeri can . I told her that I could n't manage the big Jeri can . So , she gave me a smaller one . I would keep fetching until when I fill three Jeri cans . And then after , we would go together in the garden to dig . She would dig as I am sitting , and later she would say , "@ I am fed up . You can not work anymore , so why am I keeping you ? @" those days she would n't give me food . She would let me eat only if I fetched water , allowed to go digging and look after . But it reached a point and I told her my mind . That time she had sent me at the stream and it had rained . Therefore I slipped and fell in a water channel . That is when I said , "@ this is the worst life ever . I am doing things I never did at home ; I never fetched water , I never woke up at this time . It is my first time this to happen to me . I have never dug before ; I never eat because I did this or that work . Though I fetched the water I was not allowed to shower on it . @" I had because like a slave ; I was like a servant who does n't have rights to work freely .

The army had heads of government . Every Rwandan belonged to a certain group of the army , therefore had many responsibilities but the most important was to fight for the country but there were many other things like dance , like doing all other duties , But they included fighting for the country .

Urumva yuko icyenda na gatanu yari [ 1995 ] imeze , siko deux mille [ 2000 @: ibihumbi bibiri ] imeze . Ni ukuvuga y' uko icyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] bwo umutwe wari ugishyushye ibiki byose ... Ureba n' umuntu ukaba ugahita umwikangamo ikindi kintu . Ariko uko imyaka igenda ishira , n' ubuzima bugenda bubaho , niko bisa nk' aho bihindura mu buzima ibyo utekereza ; ibyo wiga . Kuko wenda kwiga bwa mbere byarangoraga kuko wabonaga ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ngahora mbyibuka ndyamye cyangwa ndimo kugenda ahandi hantu . Cyangwa nicaye jyenyine ugasanga ibintu biragenda bigorana . Ariko ubungubu turabiganira , tugasabana numva nko mu muryango wa AERG [ Ishyirahamwe ry' abanyeshuri bacitse ku icumu rya Jenoside ] ni urugero . Abaréscape [ abacitse ku icumu ] muraganira mu bitekerezo , nabo bakakubwira ibindi mukavuga uko mwabayeho mwese . ugasanga iyo mubivuga bifite icyo bigabanuraho mu buzima bwanyu . Ukumva utangiye kuba muri société [ mu bantu ] , ukabaho neza . ||| The way things were in 1995 is not the way they were in 2000 . Everything was still very fresh on people 's minds in 1995 ... You 'd see somebody and immediately suspect him or her of being something else ... But as the years go by and things happen , as life changes , the way we think also changes as we learn new things . Maybe at first I had a problem wih going back to school , I kept remembering wherever I 'd be , while sleeping , walking or sitting on my own and that was a big issue . But today , we talk about it for example in AERG . Survivors exchange ideas and share each other 's experience and it removes a certain weight and one feels lighter . You start living with others in harmony .

When you look at its objectives , its deeds , you ought to thank A.E.R.G. It is the only association with so many people willing to help the genocide survivors , starting with young kids and themselves . I think it is an association worth ... I even worked with them and lived with them for a long time . It was an organization that helps people believe that , although they lost their parents , some friends or a fellow students can try and do as much as a parent as much as possible . And my hope is that as long as that association is still operating , orphans will stop looking at themselves as orphans . That they will find that , in the absence of their parents and friends , A.E.R.G. is there for them . That they 'll find peace in it . I know this from experience ; I once lived there and found peace in it .

The number of attackers had really increased ; it was about 8 o'clock in the evening . Then we were told that the Tutsi were in Murambi . Then we were asked to put on eucalyptus leaves since they might also come while camouflaged . Then we wore the eucalyptus leaves . It was a command from the counselor . When we reached there , we found a man called Xavier . He had a gun ... he is also in prison . After sometime , a certain man came from Murambi and told us it was no longer possible because we were few . That we should leave and come back another time . Therefore , we did n't attack on that day . We went back home with our leaders . On 21st they told us that things had worsened that we should go back to Murambi . At that time we went back and the number [ of attackers ] had increased . I was with our local leader called Senkware and another one called Serujangwe . All of them are out .
