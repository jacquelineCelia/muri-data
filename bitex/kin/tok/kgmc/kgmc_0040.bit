Eh , umugore wanjye twamenyanye kera , turi abanyeshuri muri école sécondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] . Twariganye , niho twatangiriye kuzura .

We fell in love then . After high school , we were engaged for four other years before we got married . Then in 1971 , we got married . Therefore , she was not a girl I just met and married but we were together for a long time before marriage . Even our parents knew each other because they were both pastors in the Episcopal Church in Rwanda . So we spent thirty @-@ three years together . Sorry that was n't true ; by 1994 , we had been married for twenty @-@ three years . We had two sons and three daughters together in those twenty @-@ three years .

He was a very quiet guy . He liked listening to the radio news , which used to make me predict that maybe in the future he would become a journalist or a politician . There 's nothing much I can say about him because he was not very talkative . But he loved to listen to others talking . There 's nothing more I can say . When I was leaving , I called him and told him to be the one to drive the car when they go to a place where they were planning to go with his mother . The last thing I told him was not to drive too fast and to be careful on the road . That 's all I can say .

Ariko we abaza @: "@ nguhe fanta...nguhe amazi ... nguhe icyayi ... @" wabonaga ko ari umwana witaye no ku babyeyi cyane , ahari kurenza bakuru be . ||| My fourth child was Francine Ingabire . You have her on your photos . She loved her sister Claudette very much ; she loved to swim . She was always there to talk to us after work , she would chat with us and ask her what we needed . Not many children do that but she would come and ask us if we wanted a drink or some water or tea . She was a child who cared a lot about her parents . Perhaps more than her older brothers and sisters did .

Ni uko namwandikiye agapapuro mubwira aho amafaranga ari . ||| It is hard for one to say what he or she remembers about their family members because there are so many things to remember ; it is one 's entire life . It is difficult to accept that you bring up your children and see them growing , not lacking anything and one day it all goes . It takes some strength to even acknowledge it and accept that it is actually possible . It was something very difficult to believe . Death is normal but it 's a big issue when your family just disappear all at once . It is difficult to even understand it . Sometimes it makes you wonder how God can allow such things to happen but He probably has His own plans that we can not fully understand as human beings . I remember how on the morning before I left , I thought that maybe I was not going to come back since I was going on a journey . So I left a note for my wife telling her where the money was hidden .

But Céline my daughter who survived told me some of the things . Also some neighbours who escaped death by hiding and fleeing told me about it . We were living in Kicukiro . On the first day they came to ask my family , "@ Who is Murengezi ? @" They told them I was not there . They shot my wife on the feet and said , "@ We shall come back . Find him ! @" They did not come back until the 8th when my family went to hide in a convent which was in the neighbourhood . On the 10th , they came and told them that everybody should go down , as they wanted to check their identity cards . They stood next to a roadblock and took them to a hole nearby , one by one . Some were shot dead , others were killed with a hammer , and some others were hacked . In fact , someone told me that my wife was last taken as she was limping and they shot her inside the hole where the others were . The hole is still there ; we have constructed it . About a hundred people in our neighbourhood died and we buried them all together in the same grave , which we built up . There were other people in my house apart from my wife and my children . The people who were working for us were also there . There was a lady , a friend of ours who used to work for us . She had stopped working for us as we got for her another job , she happened to be at home on that day . They checked her ID and found out she was a Hutu and they told her to leave . She was helping out my wife who was wounded and she told them she was n't going to leave and they could kill her if they wanted . So they murdered her right there next to my wife . Because he was tall , Claude , according to what his sister told me , was beaten with a club on his head and they threw him inside the hole . After hitting you with a hammer or with something else , then they would shoot you in order to stop people from making noise .

The truth is that I did not see any of this ; it is my young daughter Céline who told me about it . I do n't know if it is God who sent somebody but a soldier came and said that all the young children should go back to the nuns ' home . Céline was only nine years old then and so she went back to the nuns ' home because that man told them to do so .

Her younger sister does not say anything about her although she saw many things happen . But she just told me that they hacked her with a machete . I do n't like to ask her too many questions , because I know she does not like to talk about it . Sometimes when I ask her something she answers , but she is unable to have a long conversation about it .

Sometimes I talk to them at night as if they were still around ! It is a big problem because it can never disappear completely . God blessed me with another wife and two more children . You can never completely forget , especially at this time of the year you think about them and remember them . You can never be the same person again , your character and your whole being change . You can never forget ; it is impossible ! After living the family you lived with for twenty @-@ five years , I have told you that I met my wife in my childhood and we grew up together , we got married and we got kids and suddenly it was all gone . Sometimes you wonder why you survived !
Ariko ni byiza kuko hanyuma Imana iragushumbusha , ukaguha umugore mukabana mugafashanya byose . Bikagufasha no kurera abato bari basigaye , kuko urabizi abagabo kurera abana ari bonyine bira...biraruhanya , ariko iyo ugize Imana ukabona umugore mwiza , aragufasha mukabarera bagakura .

Kandi ukabyara n' abandi bana babiri bose beza , ushimira Imana abo bana iguhaye n' umugore wundi yaguhaye kugirango mukomeze gufatanya ubuzima busigaye . ||| But later on , God helps you and finds you another wife to help you through everything . She even helps me to bring up the children who remained , as it is difficult to bring up children on your own as a man . But when you are lucky to have a good wife , she helps you out to bring them up and they grow up . They are now grown ups , my first @-@ born son John is now married with kids and today I am a grandfather . Céline is now at the university . They were both young children and I even got two more beautiful children . I thank God for those children and for the other wife He gave me so she can be my new companion in the remaining lifetime .
Wumva ushobora kubabarira abantu bakoze biriya bintu ? ||| Can you forgive the people that did this ?
Ni...ni ikibazo gikomeye . Kuko kubabarira umuntu , ubwa mbere na mbere ugomba kubanza ukamenya uwo ari we . Kuko ntiwababarira umuntu utagusabye imbabazi . Cyangwa se utamenye uwo ari we ngo umurebe uti @: uriya yari yabaye umusazi reka mwihorere . Birakomeye rero kuvuga ijambo ryo kubabarira . Ariko mpamya ko umuntu aje akambwira ati @: " naraguhemukiye nakwiciye umugore , nakwiciye abana , " namubarira . kuko mwishe nanjye naba mbaye umwicanyi . Namubabarira rwose . Ariko ikibazo gihari ni ukumenya ahubwo uwo ubabarira uwo ari we , ni inde ? Kuko abahutu bose ntabwo bishe , ntabwo rero wavuga ngo urababarira abahutu . Ugomba kumenya umuntu ku izina rye uti kanaka yankoreye ibi ariko ndamubabariye . Kandi nk' umukristo nanjye nzi ko bavuga ngo mujye mubabarira abantu ibyaha babakorera kuko nanjye ubyo munkorera ndabibabarira . Nk' umukristo rero nemera ko umuntu ashobora kubabarira umuntu , ariko cyane cyane agomba kumenya uwo ababarira uwo ari we . Aje imbere yanjye rero akansaba imbabazi , namubabarira . Njye numva ari uko nabivuga ariko yabivuze . Kuko ntabwo watanga imbabazi ngo uvuge ngo ndababariye bande se ? Mpanya ndetse ko aricyo kintu tubura muri iki gihugu cyacu cyo mu Rwanda . Ni uko umuntu ashobora kuvuga ati @: " jyewe naraguhemukiye . nagize gutya , nishe abantu bawe , none mbabarira . @" Icyo gihe umuntu yababarira , ariko igihe abantu bose...benshi babihakana ko ntabyo bakoze , ukibaza niba abo bantu bariyishe , barapfuye gusa .

Ariko ubundi nibyo byari byiza . ||| It is a very tough question . Because , for one to be able to forgive , you first of all need to know whom you 're forgiving , you can not forgive if no one asks you to forgive him or her or when you do n't know who it is you 're forgiving . Or maybe when nobody has come to ask for forgiveness so that you can at least acknowledge that they were going through some sort of madness . The word "@ forgiveness @" is a tough one . But I believe if someone would come to me and say , "@ I betrayed you , I murdered your wife , I murdered your kids @"@ , I would forgive them . I 'd also become a murderer if I killed them . I would truly forgive them but the question is who to forgive . Who is it ? Not all Hutus killed . Therefore you can not say that you 're forgiving the Hutus . You need to know who did it and then be able to say that , so and so did this to me but I forgive him or her . As a Christian I know it is written , "@ forgive others as I forgive you . @" Therefore , as a believer I truly believe it is possible to forgive but you ought to know whom you are forgiving . So if they came before me and asked me to forgive them , I could do it . That 's the way I can put it . But the condition is that they would say it . You can not forgive in general . Who is it you 're forgiving ? I think that is what we lack here in Rwanda , that someone would come and acknowledge that they betrayed you , that they killed your people . If it were the case , people would forgive . Very few people acknowledge what they did and you wonder if these people killed themselves , if they just happened to die . It is so obvious when you compare the number of the victims to the number of those who acknowledge being the perpetrators of the genocide . The same people who were our neighbours . I 'll give you the example of one of my neighbours called Simbizi , there was one house between his and mine . We had known each other for a long time . When they arrested him they asked me to come and identify him . When I got there they asked him if he knew me , he said no ! You see how difficult it is ! Someone we used to live with and spend a lot of time with , his child used to come home and share meals with mine and he said he does n't know me and yet we were neighbours ! Despite the fact that we were neighbours , he said he did n't know me . That shows how much forgiveness will be difficult as long as Rwandans will not tell the truth about what they did . Otherwise , forgiveness is for sure the ideal thing to do .
None se ubwo wumva ubutabera bushoboka ? Cyangwa usanga budashoboka ?Wowe wumva ubutabera bwarakoze ku byaha byakorewe abana bawe ? ||| So is justice possible or not ? Do you feel justice has been done for your children ?
Kugeza ubu ntabwo irakorwa . kugeza ubu nta justice [ ubutabera ] irakorwa , eeh ... navuga kuri jye ntayo irakorwa , kandi mpamya ko no kubandi ari uko . Kuko justice y' umuntu wakumaze umuryango , wakumazeho abana , ni iyihe ? Gufungwa imyaka itanu , cyangwa itandatu , cyangwa icumi bakamufungura uba ubonye iki ? Aba ahanwe iki ? Justice...ubutabera buzakorwa abantu bazakirwa imanza bakurikije amategeko uko avugwa , ariko abenshi ntibazamenyekana . Abenshi ntabwo bazamenyekana . Niho ikibazo gikomereye . Kuko abenshi bahunze n' aho biciye , bakajya gutura ahandi batabazi . Ahandi ndetse nabagira abo bamenya bagatinya kubavuga , kuko babagirira nabi hanyuma . Ni...mu Rwanda n' ikibazo gikomeye cyane kugirango hatabaye gusaba imbabazi , no kwirega kw' abantu , no kwemera icyaha bakoze , bizaruhanya cyane . ||| So far , no ! No justice has been done so far ! In my opinion , not yet and I believe even others feel the same way . Because what justice can be done to somebody who wiped out your children , all your family ? What do you gain when they are imprisoned for five , or six or ten years ? What punishment is that ? Justice will be done according to the laws of the country , but many will never be known and that is a very big issue because many have fled from where their former residence . They now live in places where they are not known . Or maybe they are known but nobody has the courage to report them for fear that they might take revenge afterwards . It is a very big issue in Rwanda . It will be very difficult unless they ask for forgiveness and confess their sin and acknowledge them .

Kuko uretse abo mu muryango wanjye no mu muryango wo hirya , hari mukuru wanjye twari duturanye , n' umugore we , n' abana bamwe bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] urabizi familles [ imiryango ] zo muri Afrika , na data . Nabo bari bamaze gupfa . Hari ... muramu wanjye musaza w' umugore wanjye n' umugore we n' abana be batandatu , bose bari bamaze gupfa . Hari databukwe na mabukwe , bose bari bamaze gupfa . Urumva rero wumvaga ko uruhande rwawe rwose nta gisigaye . Na John...John niwe nari nzi ko ariho kuko yarigaga , yarigaga mu mahanga hanze , we nari nzi ko ariho we twaravuganaga . Ariko na Céline sinamenye ko yariho nawe nari nzi ko yapfuye . ||| I got sick , with a weird sickness I had never heard of before . My whole body was itching and I was scratching myself all over . I went to see a Doctor and they could n't give me any medication . The Psychologist told me that it 's ok to cry when I feel like it and that I could do it as much as I wanted maybe when I am alone . I was in Nairobi , Kenya then , all by myself . During the day I used to walk around and spend time with others who were in the same situation . But almost every night , I would remember everything and I would feel like I did not know where I was . In reality , apart from my close family , I lost many other relatives . My big brother who was also my neighbour , his wife and my father , some children who were living with them , you know the way the African family is , were also all killed . There was my brother @-@ in @-@ law and his wife and their six children who had also died . My father @-@ in @-@ law and my mother @-@ in @-@ law also died . It felt like you were left completely on your own . John is the only one I knew who was still alive because he was studying abroad and we used to talk on phone . At that time I did n't know that Céline survived , I thought she also died .
Ubwo rero numva ko umuryango wose @: ari umuryango w' umugore wanjye ; ari umuryango wanjye ; nta gisigaye . Ariko by' amahirwe twaje kugira amahirwe kubona abandi bavandimwe babiri basigaye , batagize icyo baba bashoboye kujya muri mille collines [ hoteli yihishemo abantu ] . Hanyuma hari na murumuna...na barumuna b' umugore wanjye babiri . Ubwo urumva rero nyuma wongeye kubona ko hari abandi bantu bakiriho , bikaguhumuriza . Bikagutera kongera gushaka kubaho , kandi cyane cyane no kureba abo bana usigaranye , ukumva ko ugomba kubaho no kugirango babeho nk' uko Imana yabaguhaye kandi basigaye . Usanga rero ari ngombwa gukora icyo ushoboye cyose kugirango n' abo basigaye bazashobore kubaho no kwiga no kugira icyo bageraho . ||| So I felt like there was no one left , either on my side , or on my wife 's side . We were lucky to later on find out that two of our relatives survived as they took refuge at Mille Collines Hotel . Also two of my wife 's sisters survived . So after the war , being able to find out that some people were still alive was very encouraging and motivated us to want to continue to live and give your best . Especially because somebody needed to look after the children who survived so that they could study and live a good life and achieve something .
Wumva wifuza ko bakwibukwa gute ? ||| How would you like them to be remembered ?
Eeh , cyane cyane nk' iyi minsi bashyiraho yo kwibuka , itariki ya karindwi ni umunsi umuntu yongera akabibuka cyane . N' ubwo n' ubundi umuntu abibuka , ariko uba umunsi usangiraho n' abandi banyarwanda kwibuka abanyu . Bigatuma mutekereza ikintu cyakorwa kugirango ibi bintu byabayeho...iri tsebwabwoko ryabayeho , ritazongera kubaho . Yewe ritazagira n' undi ribaho mu isi . Kuko ni ikintu giteye ubwoba . Kandi cyane cyane nkunda kureba amafoto yabo , kuko nari mfite mushiki wanjye wabaga i Kinshasa . Hari amafoto menshi yari afite n' amwe naberetse niwe wayampaye , kuko inzu barayitwitse yose n' ibyarimo byose ntacyo twabonye . Ariko yashoboye kuduha amafoto amwe , nkunda rero kwicara rimwe na rimwe nkayareba , kandi bituma nibuka...mbibuka . Mbese n' ubu nkibaza nti @: "@ ubu baba bameze bate ? Aba bana baba bameze bate ? Nyina wabo aba ameze ate ? @" Ni ibintu rero nibuka cyane . Kandi nta muntu ushobora kugukuramo kwibuka abantu bawe , bagize ubuzima bwawe . N' ubwo hariho abantu baba badashaka ko mubyibuka , mubivuga , ariko twebwe ntidushobora kutabyibuka . Tuzahora tubyibuka kandi n' abana bacu babimenye , kugirango nabo bazanabyirinde . Kuko ahari akenshi twa...twazize kwibwira ko bidashoboka . Ariko ubu tuzi neza ko abantu bashobora kugambirira gukora...kumaraho abantu . Igikuru cya mbere n' ukumenya ko mugomba kwanga icyo kintu . Mu bitekerezo mubyigisha abandi , kandi byaba ngombwa kubirwanya n' imbaraga...n' ingufu mukabirwanya . ||| Especially on the days that were made for remembrance , on the 7th , the day of commemoration is a day one gets to remember them a lot . Even though we remember them anyway , that day is a day you share with other Rwandans in doing so and it helps us to think together and look for a way for this never to happen again in Rwanda . And that it should not happen to anybody else worldwide because it is terrible ! I also enjoy looking at their photos . My sister who was living in Kinshasa , Congo DRC had many of their photos . She is the one who gave me even the photos I showed you since the house and everything in it was burnt up . So I sometimes sit down and look at them and I remember ! I think about them and wonder how the children would be today , how their mother would be ... It is something I remember very much . Nobody can stop you from remembering your people who were so much part of your life . Even though some people do not want us to remember or to talk about it , we can not forget them . We will always remember and even our children need to be told about it . Perhaps our biggest mistake was that we never believed it could actually happen . But now we know it is possible , we are aware that people can betray others and wipe up entire families . It is something we need to fight against in our thinking and this can be done through teaching and also in fighting against it with all our strength .
Ni iki u Rwanda rugomba gukora kugirango rwirinde ibibi nk' ibyo mu gihe kizaza ? ||| What does Rwanda need to do to avoid the same thing in the future ?
Ni nkabyo nasobanuraga mu kanya , ariko ikintu cya mbere ni ukwigisha abantu . Ni ukubasobanurira ikibi kiri mu kugira nabi . Kuko kugira nabi bigira ingaruka buri gihe kuri buri muntu . Ndahamya ko abantu babikoze igihe birukankaka ibirometero ubundi umuntu atagenda , bapfira mu nzira , bicwa n' indwara , bicwa n' amasasu , bicwa n' umunaniro . Bagenda mu ishyamba kugenda ibirometero n' ibirometero n' ibirometero bagasiga ingo zabo ni ikintu kibabaje nabo kuri bo . Kitari kubaho iyo batabikora . Kugirango rero u Rwanda ubwarwo rwirinde kuzagwa muri icyo kintu...muri ibyo byago indi nshuro , icya mbere gikuru ni ukwigisha abantu . Ngewe nishimira ibyo leta ikora , byo kujyana abantu mu ngando , kubigisha kubabwira no kubereka ingaruka zabyo kuko ntawe...ntawe zigwa neza . Ni...ni ikintu gikuru cyo kwigisha . Kandi mpamya ko bizatwara igihe kinini , kuko mu Rwanda batangiye kwigisha ibintu by' amoko muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ... mirongwitanu ... guhera icyo gihe cyose hashira imyaka igeze kuri mirongo itatu . Géneration [ ababyirutse ] yose ije , yumva icyo yumva icyo . None rero bizashaka...sinzi niba bizatwara igihe kingana gutyo na none , cyo kugirango géneration yindi ize nayo ... ize itumva ko ... umuhutu agomba kwanga umututsi , ko umututsi agomba kwanga umuhutu ... Igihe kizaba kirekire ... Ariko kugirango abanyarwanda bagere hano , aho bicanye muri Jenoside . Barabyigishijwe imyaka myinshi . Mu ishuri barabitwigishije ; kuko jye nabaye n' umwarimu , no mubyo twigishaga nabyo byazagamo , baguhaga programme [ gahunda ] y' ibyo wigisha n' ubwo utabyemera ariko ukabivuga [ araseka ] ! Byari ... icyo gihe cyabaye kwigisha igihe kininii ... N' ibindi rero , mu Rwanda nabo icyo bakwiye gukora nk' uko babitangiye ni ukwigisha . Kwigisha...kwigisha ... Kandi mpamya ko inyigisho zitanzwe neza , exemple [ ingero ] zibaye nziza , ibyitegererezo bibaye byiza , muri génération [ urubyaro ] yakurikiraho mpamya ko byashira . N' ubwo abantu bajya bibuka , ariko twajya tubyitirira ko ari imyigishirize mibi , politique mbi , byazashira buhoro buhoro . Birakomeye ko mu bantu b' ubu géneration [ urungano ] yanjye mvuge...byashira , yabyemera ariko wenda ka kantu kakirimo . ||| That 's what I was just talking about . The first thing is through educating people , to explain to people the badness that lies in doing wrong . Doing the wrong thing always has consequences on anyone . I believe the people who did it also suffered while they were fleeing their homes , walking kilometres with their families , dying of hunger and of sickness . It would never have happened if they did not do what they did . For Rwanda to avoid falling into the same problem again , the first thing is to teach people . I am happy about the work of today 's government , taking people in training camps and showing them all the consequences . Education is very important and I guess it will take a long time just like division was first taught in Rwanda in 1959 . And for thirty years each generation was taught hatred . It will take the same amount of time for the next generations to be taught that Hutu do not have to hate the Tutsi or vice @-@ versa . It will take long but the important thing to know is that for Rwandans to get to the point of committing genocide , it took very many years . It is something we were taught in school . I was once a teacher and it is something that was given in the school programme . And I myself had to say it even though I did not believe in it . There was a lot of propaganda . I believe Rwanda needs to do a lot of teaching as it has already started it . I do believe that if the teaching is well done , and if the example and the focus are good , the result will be very good in the next generations . Maybe people will still remember but we will always know how the policy and the teaching were wrong . It will end slowly . Perhaps it would be very hard for the people of my generation to forget ... well one could pretend that he or she could , but there would still be something .
Ariko mpamya ko mu bana , mu rubyiruko bagenda bigisha , bigisha inyigisho niyo ya mbere nkuru . Inyigisho niyo yabiteye , inyigisho niyo izabirangiza . Nta kindi cyabirangiza . ||| But I believe that the younger generation and the youth , if they keep on teaching .... Educational method is the primary idea . After all , it was through education that everything came up . Therefore , education is what will take it away . Nothing else can !
Turangiza mbwira uko wumva ejo hazaza ? Wilbeforce wa none ni inde ; kandi ejo hazaza uhumva ute ? Ese wumva uhafitiye ikizere , cyangwa se wumva hazaba heza ; cyangwa ... ||| Finally what is your ... How do you feel about the future ? Wilberforce , who are you today and how do you view the future ? Are you optimistic ? Are you faithful ? How do you feel ?
Aah ... ! [ araseka ] Nabanje kukubwira nti jye nk' umuntu w' Imana nizera ibintu bizaba byiza . Nizera ko akazoza k' igihugu cyacu , kazaba keza . Avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' igihugu cyacu izaba nziza . Ariko kugirango ibe nziza ni uko tubikora...ni uko tubikorera . Nitutabikorera ntabwo izaba nziza . Ariko nitutabikorera , avenir [ ejo hazaza ] yacu izaba nziza . Ni ikintu rero kitari icya Murengezi wenyine , n' ikintu kitari icya abayobozi bonyine , ni ikintu abanyarwanda bose bagomba kwiyumvisha . Ko niba dushaka kuzamera neza mu mu gihe kiri imbere , kuzirinda ibyo byose twanyuzemo , tugomba kubikorera . Ntabwo bizizana ni icyo nakubwira . ||| Ha Ha ... ! [ He laughs ] in the beginning I told you that I am a man of God . I have faith that things will be good . I trust in a better future for our country . The future of our country will be good ; but for it to be good , we will need to work towards it . If we do not work for it , it will n't happen ; but if we do , our future will be good . It is not only Murengezi 's responsibility or the government 's responsibility . All Rwandans need to understand that if we want to build a better future and to avoid what we went through in the past , we will have to work on it . Things will never happen miraculously . That 's all I can tell you .
