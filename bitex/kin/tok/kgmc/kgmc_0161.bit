I was born in Ntongwe commune in Gitarama prefecture that 's where my parents used to live and they died from there during the genocide .

Imyaka ? Navutse muri mirongo itanu na kane [ 1954 ] . ||| My age ... ? I was born in 1954 .
Ubwo amateka ya mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] nari mutoya . Ariko nari mfite ngo nk' imyaka ine ngirango , ndumva bikeya nkibyibukaho bike . Kuko nibuka iwacu duhunga .

Ibindi rero na none nzi , cyane ho nari mukuru nzi ubwenge , nari inkumi , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] . Muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] , na none ni Abahutu bicaga Abatutsi .

Ubwo turahunga , baradusenyera turongera...baravuga bati @: "@ intambara ni ihoshe , turongera dusubira mu matongo , turubaka turasana . @" ||| Well about the history of 1954 , I was still young , I was about four years old . I think I can only remember few things like when my family and I were migrating . But what I remember is the war that took place in the 1961 ... 1963 in the range of that time . Even then we migrated while they were seizing and eating our cattle , burning our houses and still it was the Hutus killing the Tutsis . They demolished the tutsi 's houses . Then other things that I remember well are the events of 1973 because then I was a wench . Still it was the Hutu killing the Tutsi . They demolished Tutsi 's houses and killed them . Some Tutsis fled . That time we fled to Kamonyi church in Gitarama [ in kamonyi district ] . Then they [ Hutus ] said that the war should stop . Therefore , we went back to our stumbles and reconstructed the houses .
Ubwo tuba aho , muri mirongo irindwi ubwo na gatatu . Birakomeza ntibyaba byiza . Na none Abahutu bakomeza gusarika Abatutsi . Bigera muri za mirongo inani...inani n' umunani [ 1980 @-@ 1988 ] , nibwo hirya no hino bagendaga nka za Bugesera ; za Kibirira ; bakomeza kugenda mbese Abahutu bakomeza gutoteza Abatutsi . Ariko byageze muri mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] , Inkotanyi ziteye , na none Abatutsi baricwa . Baratotezwa , barafungwa mu byitso , abandi baricwa baratwika . Za Kibirira aho , za Bugesera , hariya mu Bagogwe , mu Ruhengeri . Birakomeza bigeze muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] noneho , aribwo Habyarimana indege ye yahanukaga avuye Tanzaniya , bahise bica Abatutsi barabatsemba . Kuko bavugaga ngo @: "@ Abatutsi nibo bishe Habyarimana , ngo none ni babiture babice . @" Bafatanya n' abasirikare bariho icyo gihe , bafatanya n' Interahamwe zatozwaga...zari zaratojwe kera , baba ... bamwe babatorezaga mu Bugesera , abandi mu Mutara , baratojwe ibintu byo kwica gusa . Ubwo hapfaga Abatutsi , baricwa ni Abatutsi bicwaga . Ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi . ||| Then we stayed there ... that was in 1973 . The situation never improved , the Hutus continued to mistreat the Tutsis . Untill that period between 1980 and 1988 when Tutsis were menaced so much by the Hutus in areas like Bugesera and Kibirira . Generally , the Hutus continued to torture the Tutsis . Then in 1990 when the Ikontanyi [ RPF army ] invaded the country , Tutsis were subjected to serious torture ; they were killed , imprisoned accused of being traitors , others were killed , houses were burnt in all those areas of Kibirira , Bugesera and in the Bagogwe in Ruhengeri . This continued up to 1994 when Habyarima 's airplane crashed on its way from Tanzania . Then they started killing the Tutsis with all their effort saying that Tutsis were responsible for habyarima 's death . "@ Therefore , they [ Tutsis ] have to pay for it , " they said . With the help of soldiers together with the Interahamwe who had been given enough training in Bugesera and Mutara , they were trained posible methods of killing people . Then Tutsis died , they were killed ... these were the Tutsis being killed . And it was one clan killing the other .
Ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi , ntabwo ari ukuvuga ngo ni runaka wanganye na runaka nk' abaturanyi , ni ubwoko gusa bwatotejwe , hicwa ubwoko bumwe . Barabica pe ! Babica urugaraguro . Babica nabi @: abo bata mu Nzuzi ; abo bata mu Misarane ; abo bata mu Myobo ; kugeza igihe Inkotanyi zifatiye iki gihugu bahosha iyo ntambara...bahosha ubwo bwicanyi . Ubwicanyi bamaze kubuhosha , bashyiraho ko , abakoze ubwo bwicanyi babafata...bafatwa bagafungwa . Barabafunga turabavuga abantu bishe...bishe tureba , ariko ikintu cya mbere na mbere umuntu yifuza , yifuza ko habaho guhana by' intangarugero , umuntu wishe undi . Umuco wo kudahana ukaranduka . Kuko icyo gihe ku bwa Habyarimana , ntabwo umuntu yicaga undi ngo abihanirwe . Nta Muhutu wicaga Umututsi ngo abihanirwe . Yemwe no gufungwa ntiyafungwaga . Kuko yari Gahunda yateguwe kera , bari bayizi . N' ibyo bakoze , bakoze ibyo bari basanganywe , si ibyo bigiyeho . ||| It was a clan killing the other clan , it was n't like , ' a person had a grage with a fellow , ’ it was a certain clan that had been trained to kill the other clan . Therefore , one clan died . And , they really killed them ; they killed them so painfuly with a lot of torture . Some were drowned in rivers and lakes ; others were thrown in latrines or pits . Until when the Inkotanyi liberated this country and ceased the war and the killings . And later they set up a law of arresting those who perticipated in the killings . They were arrested ... those ones that we would see , we would report them . But our primary desire is to see people being purnished accordingly . A killer ... the culture of not punishing should be abolished completely . Because during Habyarimana 's regime no body would be punished over killing someone . A hutu would not be punished for killing a tutsi . Neither would he be imprisoned . It was an earlier planned program and they all knew all about it . All they did , they were prepared for it [ genocide ] , it was not a sudden event .
Ikintu cya mbere mbona kiza rero , ni umuco wo guhana . Bagahana uwibasiye undi bagahana umuntu wishe undi by' intangarugero , kandi kumugaragaro . N' abandi bakaboneraho . Ikindi rero kiza ni uko aya mateka , y' ubu bwicanyi bw' abatutsi bishwe bahorwa ubusa ... b' inzirakarengane . Numva ko bigomba ... nako sijye jyenyine , ni twese . Bitasibangana , bidakwiye kwibagirana , dukwiye guhora tubyibuka , kandi bikandikwa no mu bitabo . N' abana ... ab' abana bacu bazabyara bakazakura bazi...bakavuka ba ... ibyo bitabo bihari babisoma , bamenya icyabaye , bitibagiranye . Bakamenya icyabiteye icyo gihe , bakamenya abantu bicaga abandi , bakamenya ko abahutu bishe abatutsi icyo gihe . ||| The most important thing is to set up a culture of punishing those who harassed others ... those who killed others . They should be punished accordingly and in public for others to see and learn a lesson . And another important thing is ; this history of the killings of the innocent tutsis , who died for no reason , should never perish . Not only my testimony but also everyone 's . It [ history ] should never be forgotten . We should always remember it . It must be written in books so that our grand children will be able to read and know what happened . They should know the cause , who killed who ... they should know that the Hutus killed the Tutsis that time .
Ariko bagahana ba bantu , by' intangarugero . Ku buryo umuco wo kwica ... wo kwicana wacika . N' utekereza kwica , akabitinya kubera ko azi ko yabihanirwa . ||| But they should punish those people accordingly so that the culture of not punishing stops . That way , the habit of killing one another will stop . Even that one who had a thought of killing would stop because he or she knows she would be purnished for it .
Numvaga hari utubazo dukeya numva nakubaza , kugirango dukomeze dusobanukirwe n' ibyabaye . Watubwiye ko muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] wari uriho , ariko wari ukiri mutoya .

You told us that in 1959 you already existed but you were still young . But you can tell us the little you remember about the way they attacked how it was in your area , how you fled or what happened to you . Just tell us in breif what happened during that time .
Muri makeya , nari Mutoya ariko ku buryo byibuka . Hariho amashyaka . Hariho Unar ; hariho Parmehutu ... M.D.R Parmehutu ; hariho Rader ; hariho Aprosoma . Hariho mbese amashyaka nk' ayo .

Yemwe n' abahutu baba baturutse ahandi bakamenya rwa rugo rw' umututsi . Bakarutwika ; bakarya inka ; baranabica . Ubwo nicyo cyatumye n' abahunze mirongo itanu n' icyenda barahunze . Ni uko nabo batotejwe , icyo gihe ariko ari inyoko Tutsi itotezwa . Ni abahutu icyo gihe n' ubundi batotezaga...bicaga abatutsi . Biraza bigera muri za mirongo itandatu na kangahe...na...mirongo itandatu ... ||| In brief , I was young but I can remember some . There were parties like UNAR , PARMEHUTU ... MDR @-@ PARMEHUT , RADER , and PROSOMA . However MDR @-@ PARMEHUTU was a Hutu party and UNAR was for tutsi . Members of UNAR party were on the king 's sid ; those are the people who were in the king 's party . Therefore those Hutus were against UNAR . And then later the Hutus became more powerful than the Tutsi because they got support from the Belgians . They abused the tutsi and destroyed their houses . On the Tutsi 's gate there was a picture of a tutsi in white clothes and on the Hutu 's gate there was a red piece of cloth . There were airplanes everywhere in the skies . Therefore those colors were to help them identify between the Hutu 's home and the Tutsi 's home . They would put the red piece of cloth in front of the house and hung it in a tree . Therefore , they would tell it was a Hutu 's house and the one with out one , they would tell it was a Tutsi 's home . Even Hutus from other areas would tell the tutsi 's home and burn it . They would eat cattle and even killed them [ Tutsis ] . That was the reason why some people fled in 1959 ; because they were subjected to torturend . The Tutsi ethnic was tortured . Still it was the Hutus torturing and killing the Tutsi . The situation continued like that till 1960s ...
Muri icyo gihe , mu muryango w' iwanyu ntimwatewe ? ||| During that time was your family attacked ?
Umh , twarahunze . Ndabyibuka nari mutoya muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] . Twarahunze bateye iwacu baratwika , duhungira nko ku musozi wo hakurya , hari ishyamba . Kubera ko hari inka nyinshi duhungana n' inka . Ariko baradusenyera . ||| We fled . I remember that in 1963 I was very young . We fled after they attacked our home and burnt our houses . We fled to a certain hill , which was a bushy . We had a lot of cattle ; therefore we migrated with them . However they demolished our houses though .
Mwavuye ku Musozi mwari mutuyeho witwa ... ? ||| What was the name of that hill where you were living before migrating ?
Eh , ahongaho twari dutuye ku musozi witwa...hitwa Ikibanda , tujya ahandi hantu hirya y' Ikinazi , ahantu hari ishyamba bitaga Inyabusunzu . Icyo gihe abatutsi benshi barahakoraniye , kuko bagiye gutwika batwikira rimwe . N' inka zabo n' abana . Bamwe bahita bagenda bajya iyo za Bugesera abandi baza banaza hano za Sainte @-@ famille hariya . Burya Kiliziya nta gihe abantu batayihungiyemo . Uretse muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , nibwo bayihungiyemo banayirwamo . Ubwo icyo gihe nabwo byarabaye bikomeza bityo ; batera abantu bakarya inka , abandi bakica bagakubita amahiri ... Abantu baranapfuye , abandi bajya mu mahanga . Ariko bariya bagiye mu mahanga , ntabwo bagiye bagiye ku bundi buryo , ni ku buryo bwo guhunga abahutu bari babamenesheje mu Gihugu . Nta gihe umuhutu atatoteje Umututsi . Kuva muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] kugeza ejo bundi muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , ni abahutu bicaga abatutsi . ||| Eh ... we were living on a hill called Ikibanda . We left that place and went to some place beyond Kinazi . There was a forest called Nyabusunzu . That time many Tutsis gathered there because most of their houses were burnt at the same time . They met there with their cows and their children . Some people [ Tutsi ] went to Bugesera and others went to Sainte @- famille church . In the past , people had been running to church on several occasions unlike in 1994 when people ran there and died from there . Even that time same thing happened and continued like that ; they attacked and killed , hit Tutsis with club , some people died , and others fled to exile . There was no other reason why people [ Tutsis ] went to exile ; they were fleeing from the Hutus , who were menacing them with in the country . There is no time when a Hutu stopped torturing a Tutsi ever since 1959 up to 1994 . It was always the Hutu killing the Tutsi .
Hari abo uzi bishwe , waba uzi amazina wenda ukavuga uti kanaka yaratwikiwe baramwica ... ||| Do you know by names , anyone who was killed ? For example you can tell us that ; so and so , their houses were demolished and later they were killed ...
Eh iwacu ? ... Icyo gihe muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ? ||| In our family ... ? Are you talking about the time in 1959 ?
Itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] .... itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] kugeza aho . ||| Yes between 1959 and 1963 , within that range ...
Eh , hari abasaza ... hari abasaza , barapfuye abo basaza , ariko abandi bagiye mu mahanga banagwayo . Harimo na musaza wanjye waguye muri Tanzaniya . Yagiye yubatse yitwaga Kamonyo . Eh , yari abyaye , yagiye Tanzaniya abayo ni naho yapfiriye . Ariko nyuma abana be n' umugore baje kuza , yari afite abana batatu . Abana be umwe yanagu...banamwiciye hano ku Mumena muri Jenoside . Bagiye bapfa benshi barapfuye , barabishe barapfa . Ni uko aba ari na kera umuntu ahari aba atabyibuka cyane . Yee , ariko barapfuye . ||| Yes , some old men died . Though some went to exile and died there ; my brother died from Tanzania . He migrated to Tanzania when he was already married with children . He lived there untill when he died . And later , his wife and children came back ; they were three children and one of them was killed during the Genocide from a place called Mumena . Several people died ; they were killed . And since it was long time ago , somethings are hard to recall them well . But people died a lot .
Ubwo mujya kuri uwo Musozi mwagarutse mu rugo ? ||| When you ran to that hill , did you return home ?
Eh twaje kugaruka . Baje kuvuga bati @: "@ ihumure ryaje . @" Ubwo niko mbese bavugaga bati @: "@ ihumure ryaje bati @: abantu nibagaruke mu ngo , " turongera kuragaruka . Ku buryo ubwo twagarutse abandi bamwe barakomeje baragenda . Byatumye bajya no mu mahanga , abataragarutse mu ngo . Barimo n' uwo musaza wanjye . ||| Yes we came back home . They had said that there was some stability as they always did . They would say that , "@ things have stablised , people should come back home . @" Then we returned home . Others proceeded and ended up going to exile . My brother was among those who did n't come back home .
Biraza bigera rero Habyarimana afashe ubutegetsi muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] . Watunyuriramo muri makeya noneho uko byagenze , kuko wari mukuru ...

Badushyiraga hariya kuri Gereza ya muhima bahitaga Komisaliya [ commissariat ] , hari kuri Komisaliya icyo gihe . ||| Well in 1973 , it was Kayibanda still on power . Habyarimana was chief commander . I remember it was on the 28th feb 1973 , when they attacked our home village . They burnt and killed many people . That time they killed so many people . I had a brother -in-law whose shop was destroyed . He escaped through a bush . They tried to look for him but they never got him . But his shop was already distroyed . That time we fled and came to Kigali in Biryogo . We spent there less that a month 's time . Then they made a patrol of capturing all the Tutsis and take them to Bugesera in Maranyundo . I guess you have ever heard about it ... I am among the people who were imprisoned in Maranyundo . Even that time they made a patrol but it was just for getting the Tutsis . We realised it when we were in Bugesera . They came and transported us to Bugesera in Maranyundo in the bush . They used trucks , min buses , and those big cars that transport beers from Gisenyi [ from Bralirwa ] . Therefore they gathered us there in t he Muhima prison . By then it was a police . It used to be called Commissariat .

Amashyaka nabwo icyo gihe ... iryo shyaka naryo ryari rimeze nka Parmehutu uko yari imeze mbere . ||| During Habyarimana 's party @-@ struggles ... ? There was CDR , MRND there was also another party , which was suppressed or discriminated against , because they considered it to be a Tutsi 's party . This party was called PL . But the strongest and powerful parties in the country were CDR and MRND . We were oppressed and tortured very much . After Bucyana death , we were attacked and my husband was beaten . They left knowing that he was died . They robbed us ... by then we were living over there , near Kabuga 's building . But we were thrown out of our house and we started sleeping around like we did have where we belonged . That was the beging of those tortures ; just from those parties . For example whenever CDR would strike , people would be beaten ... I am telling you , people would die . They used to have grenades . Therefore , they would throw grenades to places like shops where several Tutsis would attend or drink beers . For example there was a certain man , who lived in Muhima and owned a boutique . Therefore , people were obliged to drink from Kamanda 's boutique because if they went to CDR 's bars they would not get out still alive . Even if it were women like us , we would be so careful to buy something like sugar from there . Because if you accidentaly stepped on somebody you would be beaten . Even Kamanda was one of the people who were being menaced . Infact he was killed just of recent . He was a young man not very mature ; he was n't even married . Generally they menaced people ... there is no single day when they stopped menacing people ; it is a long story . Therefore , Kamanda 's shop was crached with a grunade by the CDR members . Whenever they would strike , they would kill people ; they would burn places with grunades . Never the less they would ambush people on roads . They would stub people with bayonets . CDR was Habyarimana 's political party , it was simillar to PARMEHUTU of the past .

You said it was the most horrible time . Would you tell us in a detailed way , how you persisted in 1994 till when you survived ? Tell us how they killed your children or your husband or your relatives ... tell us how you struggled to hid , how it was or if you were injured or hurt ... things of the sort but much more information . Tell us what happened till when you survived .
Eh muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , Habyarimana yapfuye ku itariki esheshatu . Hari ngirango kuwa gatatu ndabyibuka . Nko mu ma saa tatu , nibwo babivuze...RTLM , na Radio Rwanda .

It 's when it was announced on Radio Rwanda that HABYARIMANA has died on a plane crash . Then they started killing Tutsi people , who used to live around Kanombe . Areas like Kabeza , Kicukiro ... those areas of Hotel Chez Lando in Remera . Soldiers took up those areas and killed every Tutsis around those places . And sudenely the killings had spread every where in the city . It was just through God 's grace that you got a hiding place .

And , a certain lady who was living there hid her under her bed . I continued and passed via the police station . Because , there at Manumental ... there was a horrible roadblock that nobody would escape . Therefore I said to myself , "@ I rather pass via the police and if there are policemen , they better shot me rather than being hacked . @" Therefore , I proceeded and the policemen saw the kids . Then they ased them , "@ you kids , where are you going ... ? I was carrying another baby at my back .

One would just say a simple prayer , "@ God , take my life as you wish . @" Suddenly a certain policeman who used to come to our home appeared . Then I begged him , "@ Nkyesha !

And , as he was asking , the first boy disappeared and another one followed , in no time we were left only two of us . It was that policeman , who took me to Nyarugege commune and we stayed there . However , the next get to the commune was , seized by the soldiers [ the presidential guard unit ] . They retreated to Nyarugenge after the Inkotanyi had chased them from Kimihurura where they had suffered defeat in the battle with RPF soldiers . When we reached there , we found when they had siezed that gate and the house was full of their wives and children . I remember we were many people , who had got to seek refuge there . Some were coming from those ends of Kivugiza , Cyahafi , Muhima ... we were very many about one hundred and eighty [ 180 people ] they refused to allow us in saying that , we should go and join those Nyenzi [ cockroaches ] .

In those days the militias and ex @-@ government soldiers used to come slaughter people and others were kidnapped and taken to undisclosed destination . In that period there was a seminar being conducted at Kabusunzu which brought together people from all provinces , and it was by people of all ethnic groups . Those of them who had national identity cards , which show that they were Hutus , were given transportation and other necessary facilities . While as those who were Identified as Tutsis , were put in buses , and brought to the place where we were for execution .

After all the men were killed , our turn came . But before they had killed any of us ( woman ) one of the Interahamwe milicious from Butaro said ; "@ as you are going to finish them all , who shall escort our parent Habyarimana After on the day of his burial ?

And secondly , the genocide history should be maintained and we should never forget .

So he went to seek asylum there but later , a certain soldier took him ; he was from the presidential guard unit and his name was Rurangiza . I do n't even know that so called Rurangiza , maybe if we met on the way we would pass by each other . So , he [ Ruranngiza ] first asked him what he was . And when my husband said that he was a Tutsi , the soldier laughed mockingly and said , "@ I have killed so many tutsi and this one is going to be the last victim in my hands . @" He held his gun and fired over my husband 's head and my husband fell down . He was latter taken to CHK [ a hospital ] together with other wounded people and he was dressed .

That they used to only cover them without applying any medicine . Later there came another notorious killer called Kamashini , who took them away . He was the one responsible for all killings that took place at CHK hospital . So he took them to Kigali military camp , where they were chopped with bayonettes and their eyes were scooped out before thier death . That is part of what I heard . My husband is among those who died from CHK and he was exhumed and reburied in Rebero . That is what happened . And about my died child ; my baby died and it was buried in Gakingiro . It was still young fed on breast milk . Therefore , it died of hunger due to stavation . That is all .

Ko ari ikibazo ! Simbizi sinzi ko ... Wenda sinzi uko bizategurwa , ariko simbizi . ||| By the way , the issue of unity and reconciliation is not easy . Those ideas of unity and reconciliation are more like ... sincerely , reconciling with some one who killed your people , is next to imposible ; where would one gain that spirit in order to reconcile ? I wonder what would have happened , for such people to reconcile . I can n't even imagine the beginning of all the act of reconciliation . A person can reconciliate with one whom they talk . Let 's say ; one can tell the other that , "@ please I am sorry ! I insulted you . Forgive me . @" But I can n't imagine someone who killed more than twenty people of your family members , standing infront someone asking him or her to reconcile . How possible would that be ? It is a problem maybe there is a way they are planning to do it , which I can n't imagine .
Ubona iriya Commission ibishijwe se izagera ku nshingano zayo ... byo byoroshye ? ||| So , do you thing that the commission in charge of unty and reconciliation will reach its goals easily ?
Iriya Commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ? Iriya Commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge rero , wenda ahari izabigeraho simbizi , ariko se njye mbona atari vuba . Mbona bitazashoboka vuba . Ntabwo bizashoboka vuba , kuko n' uwakwiciye afite umujinya . Ukanabibona akanabikwereka . Ubwo se uwo muziyunga mute ? Ko akurusha umujinya ariwe waguhemukiye . ||| You are talking about that commission of unity and reconciliation ... ? That commission ... maybe it will succeed , who knows ? Though it will require them a lot of time . It seems too impossible to achieve their goals in a short time . Because , it is astonishing how those who perticipated in the genocide [ Interahamwe malicious ] still have strong hatred and whenever they see you , they try to show you that they still hate you . So , how do you expect reconciliation to take place since he or she , who did those things has more grievance than the one he or she hurt ?
Hari urwego rurebana na Jenoside nyine yabaye mu Rwanda , uretse inzego za leta hariho n' andi ma commission menshi nk' ayo y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ... Ariko mu rwego rw' ubucamanza harimo , eh ... imanza bazaca muri iyi minsi , ndetse zanatangiye imanza bita iza Gacaca , zo waba uzivugaho iki ? Hari icyo zizacyemura mu rwego rwo guhana guhana abazize ... abakoze itsembabwoko . ||| There are other organisations concerned with the Rwandan genocide , which are non @-@ governmental . Plus several other commissions around the contry like that of unity and reconciliation . And there are also judicially commissions called Gacaca . I guess , are in operation . What can you say about them ? do think they are going to help in purnishing those who perticipated in the genocide ?
Umva rero ... Gacaca ... ngirango abantu bavuze Gacaca ntabwo mbasuzugura sinabagaya . Ariko Gacaca kera njyewe uko nyizi , nari nzi Gacaca umuntu yoneshereje undi ; umuntu yarwanye n' undi ; noneho bakaregana . Mu nzego za Gacaca bakabunga muri Gacaca .

Sinzi ibyo ari byo . ||| Listen ... Gacaca ... people who voted for Gacaca , I neither dismiss them nor disrespect them . But how I used to understand Gacaca from the past experience is different from today 's Gacaca . Gacaca used to take place once someone had grazed his cattle on the fellow 's crops or if two people had faught together . Then they would report to gacaca courts where they would later reconcile the two . But I had never had of Gacaca for the killers ... [ She gulped ] . I do n't even have words to say about it . That so called Gacaca ... it came into existance in order to set those perpetrators free ; those who would admit that they killed ahundred people would be set free . I hear that in Gacaca perpetrators ask for forgiveness , or they will be asking for forgiveness . What about those who are already released ? Did they ask for forgiveness ? If yes , whom did they ask for forgiveness ? Umh ! Who did they ask for forgiveness ; Is it the government or is it the people whom they killed their loved ones ... ? what happened exactly ? That is the question we ask ourselves . From no where one hears that so and so was released , yet you had convicted him or her because you witnessed his or her deeds . Then one starts wondering ; "@ did they find him or her innocent for them to release him or her ... ? @" that is a big issue . No body knows how the government goes about it . But if we concinder our acient rwandan gacaca , there was no gacaca for killers before . It is beyond my imagination ... I can n't even understant it . "@ Gacaca for killers ! @" it is unbelievable !
Dukomeje wenda nkubajije ikindi kibazo , ibyo ari byo byose igihugu icyo ari cyo cyose cyubakwa n' amaboko y' abana bana babo bashyize hamwe . Kandi nk' uko wari uri kubivuga , nyuma y' itsembabwoko abantu basa nk' aho habaye ibice mu bantu , bitariho bifatanya mu rwego rwo kubaka igihugu . Ubona iterambere ry' igihugu ... mbese igihugu cyacu aho kigana wumva wagira icyo ubivugaho ? ||| Let us proceed . I would like to ask you another question . Whatever maybe the case , a nation is built by its natives when they put their hands together . And as you said earlier that after the genocide , some people divided themselves into separete divisions . Which divisions , seem to be helpless as far as developing our country is concerned . So , what can you talk about the development of our country ... what can you predict about her future ?
Igihugu cyacu aho kigana kugirango kigira iterambere , numva nk' abanyarwanda bose bashyira hamwe . Bakubaka igihugu . Ariko bizaterwa n' iki ? No guca umuco wo kudahana .

Ibyo rero ni uguca ... ni ukurandura umuco udahana nyine nibyo byiza . Ibyo baramutse babikoze igihugu cyacu cyatera imbere . Kuko n' abahungabana , no mu bihungabanya abantu babonye Jenoside ... bahuye nayo batotejwe , na biriya byo ku Gikongoro byajemo . Kuko twarahungabanye twese tutanahegereye . Twahise twumva ko natwe twese ariko tugomba kumera . ||| In order for our country to experience development in the future , all rwandans should put their hands together and try to build their nation . But this shall be achieved only if they try to eliminate the habit of not purnishing . Whoever that has plans of doing bad deeds especialy killings because it was one of the deeds that led into distruction of our nation . Should be punished in public where everybody will be seeing in order to frighten those who have the same plans . Because they will know that , if they do the same thing , they will be treated in the same way . Therefore , if they stop that habit [ not punishing ] the country will be built and will become pleasing . Therefore , in order for our contry to be pleasing , the young ones will have to continue in the line of development ; they will have to finish their studies and improve our contry . First of all , they have to know that the killers still have the intentions of killing . Therefore , they have to first sencitize them and teach them that , they have to live with others peacefully without killing . Fir example those people in Gikongoro whom they sentenced to death . I hope they will shut them in open . And I believe that , if they do it in public , I guess in Gikongoro there will be no more killings . Because no one can see his fellow being shot on a tree and then he goes a head with his wrong plans that would take him to the same tree . Therefore , eliminating the habit of ont punishing is the best . If they do so , our country will develop . Because those are one of the things that distablise genocide survivors . Because when we had about what took place in Gikongoro , we were all afraid . We thought the same thing would happen to us ...

Ariko nyuma atagiye muri wa muco wo kwanga umuntu ngo uriya ni uyu . Niyo mpanuro naha abana batoya . ||| The advice I can give to young children ... first of all they should learn how to love . The first thing id to love . Sencondly they should put much effort in education because there will be no bright future for them if they do n't go to school . They should study and love each other . They should avoid hatred among them in all their lifetime on earth . Because where there is love , nothing misses . Therefore , the youngones should love each other . I guess even those kids who became Interahamwe ; it was due to their elders . But if the children experiences love , and be taught about love rather than hate . And avoid seeing their fellows and say , "@ look at that tutsi . @" Like they used to learn in the past . In the past . Tutsi children used to believe that they were ment to be menaced . Like during the genocide , some children would tell the killers that , "@ please forgive me , I will never be a Tutsi again . @" Just imagine , those were very young children but they already knew that they were menaced because they were Tutsis . Therefore , hatred should be up rooted and they should only keep in mind that there are only rwandans . And , every human being has a right to live . No one should be killed . That is the most important thing for the young ones . If they love each other , one would be knowing that , "@ I have to study for my own life . @" And the other one would say , "@ I want to do this and that . @" if he or she is good at business , then he or she should run business . If one is good at cultivatng , then she or he should mean business and cultivate . But forgeting that habit of having second thoughts about his or her fellows . That is my advice for children .
Ubwo ngirango nink' impanuro y' abana batoya b' Abanyarwanda muri rusange . Ariko nifuzaga ko kubw' umwihariko ku bana bagiriwe itsembabwoko , ko hari icyo waba ... wababwira mu rwego rwo kwiyubaka . ||| Hope that is the advice to the children in general . Now can you give any piece of advice to the children who were affected by the genocide ? What advice can you offer them about how to improve on them selves ?
Mu rwego rwo kwiyubaka , abana bakorewe itsembabwoko basigaye iheruheru , batagira ababyeyi ; batagira umuryango . Bakwiye kwihangana . Bakikurikirira kwiga . Yego nta buzima burimo bwiza , kuko mu mutwe wabo hara ... haratobamye . Iyo umwana adafite umubyeyi burya nta...nta kiza aba afite . Ariko nibihangane kuko nta kundi twabigenza .

Akamenya ko hari umuntu wasigaye bahuje icyo kibazo . ||| In the flame of development ... children who experienced genocide were left in misery without parents . They were left homeless , they should be strong and patience and , mind about their education . I know there is no good life , their heads had frozen . Because , when a child has no parents , life seem to be meaningless . Therefore they should be strong because there is no alternative . If they come across their fellows with the same problems , they should befriend one another and talk about their problems . If it is a parent , she will tell them that , "@ my children come we chat a bit . @" Ever , when you meet with people you experienced the same problem ; you fell relieved just because you found someone to tell about your problems , someone who understands it . That is what I can advise them . Children who faced that problem should love and know each other . If they meet challeges , they should learn how to adress those problems to the older people who were once in the same situation . Because grown @-@ ups know how to comfort children . You can tell a child that , "@ be strong there is no alternative . @" And if you are neighbours , then you try to visit each other . That helps the children to know that there are some other people who faced the same problems like they did .

I wonder what to tell them ; I can not tell them that , "@ never do it again . @" Because if they had a chance they would repeat it today . Most of them do n't even agree that they perticipated in the genocide . They deny it yet you witnessed them doing those deeds . Therefore , which kinds of advice can one give such a person ? Instead they should repent for their sins in they feel it down inside their hearts ... if their hearts haunts them . They should try to say the truth and ask for forgiveness as they say . They should repent before God because even those they killed were God 's creatures . Therefore they should repent before God because if they do so , they will be able to ask me to forgive them . And I will be sure that if we met somewhere , they would never hurt me . I just do n't know the kind of advice I should give to such people .

For example ; in your marriage life , there were some words that your husband used to say to you and those words made you feel so good . It maybe your children ... the one who died ... or your neighbours . Personally , what do you remember that gives a lot of sorrows more than other things yet it was as a result of the genocide ?
Eh ! Reka nkubwire , nka buriya ikintu gikomeye cyane , kibukwa kandi na buri wese , kireba .

Be it the young children who have to mature before time , they will bare that grief of prematuring yet they were surpposed to be sat before their parents like other children of their age . Therefore , those things can be so hurting . When it comes to a tough problem of tracing a living , especialy on special days . For example , some children mature and reach a time of marrying . Those children begin saying , "@ I wish I at least had an aunt or one of my parents . @" It becomes a very big problem . There are several problems in fact everything reminds those days .

And then you see your child coming back home that the teacher has chased them because you never sent him money . I remember ... that is when I remember , when life becomes hard . Some times I get worried , "@ what will they eat tomorrow ? What will take before going to school ? Or what will they have for dinner ? @" then I say , "@ if they had a father , would n't have been this worried . @" Well I am not alone , it happens to every parent who faced that problem of genocide .

It means that , the oldest of all acts as a parent to the rest and she or he is taken to be in charge of the whole home . Then you reflect their example to your life and say , "@ how come those orphans survive ? @" and again , you think about your fellow survivors and ask yourself , "@ how are they surviving ? @" by considering other people 's lives , it will help you . We live together in the same residence for the survivors , but it is useful for us because we are neighbbouring each other yet we have the same problems . Therefore , you refer to your fellows and ask yourself , "@ how come they are still strong ? Let me try and be strong too . @" That is all that can help someone . But , if you are lonely you may spend your entire life in problems . Otherwise , when you are challeged by problems , you join others and laugh , share a drink and dedicate the rest to God . That is what helps us most of the time .

Wowe hari icyo bikubwiye kumva ko amahanga yumvise ko Jenoside yabaye mu Rwanda . ||| Ten years have passed and in few days to come there will be an occasion of commemorating for the ten years that have passed after the genocide , which took place in Rwanda . All other nations admmitted that there was genocide in Rwanda . Does it have any meaning to you , hearing that other countries agree that there was genocide in Rwanda ?

Ibyo bintu birashimishije cyane . Guhora iteka tubyibuka . Nabyo mu binyubaka biranyubaka . ||| I was very happy . Because some of the things that used to hurt us ... for example there are some foreigners who used to come here in AVEGA . And they would ask permission to meet us because they realy wanted to see those people who were victimised by the genocide . The Jews also came to see us ; among those who came , there was a lady ... I do n't remember other people who came with her but some time ago , they also experienced genocide like we did . One of them told us that , "@ my grandparents are victims of the holocaust . According to what we saw and heard , we thought that in Rwanda we would find when people had gone crazy . We thouhght that , it would be very hard to get close to you . But surprisingly you look good ! You are still able to wear a smile ! @" and for sure , she was astonished . However , there was another person who came and told us that , "@ we do n't agree that what happened here was genocide . According to what we heard that happened here , we do n't believe it was genocide . @" Therefore , that denial of the genocide would terribly hurt us because we would n't imagine why they would denay genocide yet it happened ! So what amases us is the fact that all nations agreed and realised that genocide happened in Rwanda . It is so amasing . And among the things that keep me strong , is commomerating the genocide all the time .
