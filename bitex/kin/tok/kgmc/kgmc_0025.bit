Turagenda noneho tugeze haruguru munsi y' urusengero . ||| We went below the church
Hari umuzungu wari uhatuye ashobora kuba ari umu pasteur ahari . ||| There was a white man who lived there , he might have been the pastor
Akaba abahungu ba safari ngirango bari basanzwe baziranye ahari . ||| And he seemed well acquainted with Safari 's sons
Umupasteur wirihe dini ? ||| A pastor of which religion ?
Ni umupasteur waho kuko yari atuye inyuma y' urusengero . ||| He was the pastor of that area because he lived behind the church
Urusengero rwaha haruguru rw' abametodiste . ||| The church up here which was Methodist

Twe dusigara inyuma y' urupangu hari urupangu rw' imiyenzi dusigara inyuma yarwo hanze aho . ||| We remained behind the fence , there was a fence made of shrubs and we remained behind it
Nari ndi kumwe na oscar . ||| I was with Oscar
Ubwo baragiye arabakingurira . ||| They went over and he opened for them
Arabemerera ubwo ako kanya na safari aba arahageze . ||| And let them in , after a while Safari also went over
Nawe ahita yinjira twebwe dusigara aho ngaho baratubwira ngo turindire . ||| And he also entered but we remained outside because they asked to wait
Baza kutubwira hashize akanya umuhungu we mut ..... ||| They came to tell us after a while ........
Yinjira kwa pasteur wa ba metodiste ? ||| He entered the Methodist pastor 's place ?
Yego ikibazo ngo cyari gihari nuko twashoboraga kwinjira bakaba badusangamo bakatwiciramo twese . ||| Yes the problem was that we would all enter an they would find us and kill all of us
Ubwo nibwo umuhungu we yahise asubirayo ahita afunga umuryango . ||| That 's when his son went back and closed the door
Ubwo twarahagumye . ||| So we remained there
Uwo muhungu yitwa nde ? ||| What was that boy 's name ?
N' umuhungu we mutoya ntabwo mwibuka neza . ||| He was his youngest son I do not remember him very well

Ubwo twarahagumye kugeza kumugoroba mu ma saa cyenda nibwo batangiye kurasa kuri SND . ||| So we remained there till evening around 3 o'clock and that 's when the shooting started at the parliament
Ubwo tuguma twihishe aho ngaho byageze nko mu ma saa kumi nimwe nibwo ba safari bongeye barasohoka . ||| So we remained in hiding there , I was at 5 o'clock when Te Safari 's came out
Noneho ngirango bagiye kureba nyina , nyina wabo bahise bagarukana . ||| And I thought that they were going to see their mother , and they immediately came back with her
Baraza barinjira turababaza niba dushobora kwinjira natwe ||| They entered and we asked them if we could also enter
Baraduhakanira . ||| And they said no
Ubwo butangiye guhumana bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi nebyiri . ||| Then it started to become dark at around 6 o'clock
Turavuga tuti ntabwo twaguma hano . ||| And we decided that we were not going to stay there
Reka tujye kureba uko byagenze murugo kuko hari havugiye amasasu menshi nkuko yari yabivuze . ||| We decided to go and check on things at home because there were a lot shots fired as he had said
Bari bateya kwa gatera . ||| They had attacked Gatera 's
Twagezeyo baba bamaze kugenda nta muntu numwe uhari . ||| We got there when they had already left , no one was there

Ubwo nibwo twamusabye ngo aturebere iyi nzira ya hano hepfo . ||| That 's what we asked him to do , to check this path down here
Arebeko twabasha gutambuka . ||| To see if we can pass

Bari basigaye kwa etienne . ||| They had remained at Etienne 's

Uretseko hari decision nashakaga gutanga . ||| But there is a decision I wanted to give
Uwo munsi barasa ubona ibintu bimeze nabi . ||| That day when the shooting took place and things looked bad
Naje guterefona munyengoga ...... ndamubwira nti se ko mbona ibintu bimeze nabi . ||| I called Munyengongo....and told him that things looked bad
Uwakohereza abana ukabampishira . ||| Can I send you my children for refuge
Aransubiza ati se urumva ufite ubwo nti se wowe urumva utabugira . ||| And he replied that you are not afraid ?
Ubwo mfata umukobwa wange mukuru na burumuna bwe buto bubiri na mushiki wanjye . ||| Then I got my eldest daughter her siblings and my sister
Nagirango abo bana bawe ujye ubavuga amazina . ||| I would like you refer to your children by name

Mvugana na madamu nti ibyiza nuko wasigarana n' abana . ||| And spoke to the wife saying that it would be good if you remained with the children
Nti niho hari securite kurusha naho tugiye . ||| That 's where there is more security than my place
Twahise tumanuka . ||| We immediately sloped together
Tugeze kwa makuza twahabaye iminsi ibiri nkuko mucyo yabivuze . ||| When we got to Mukuza 's we stayed there for 2 days as Mucyo said
Ubwo twaravuganaga nabo kuri terefone . ||| We communicated with them by phone
Madamu twaravuganaga kuwa gatandatu mugitondo . ||| I spoke to my wife on Saturday mornings
Twaravuganye ambwirako etienne yababwiye yuko kuberako we yasohokaga yajyaga hanze . ||| We spoke and she told me that Etienne told them that since we used to go out
Ko ibintu bitameze neza . ||| That things were not good

Nkuko mucyo yabivuze hari urupfu rwa ruzagiriza tutasobanukiwe neza nagirango murumuna we mukugaruka aduhe ibisobanuro murakoze . ||| As Mucyo said there was the death of Ruzagiriza that we never understood I would like his brother to come back and give us an explanation , thank you
Ruzagiriza ubwo twaramanutse nkuko nabivuze aho twari twihishe tuvuye mu masaka . ||| Ruzagira , so we sloped down as I had said w were coming a garden of millet
Tugera kwa makuza kwa makuza twaje kuvayo nyuma y' iminsi ibiri ngirango hari nko kuwa gatandatu ahari . ||| We got to Mukaza 's which we left after 2 days it must have been a Saturday
Tujya muri mille colline . ||| And went to Mille Collines
Tugenda muri mille colline ariko kuberako abantu bari benshi . ||| We went to Mille Collines but because there were many people
Twagiyemo mubice donc hari abantu basigaye abari begeranye n' imodoka zari zihari . ||| We entered in groups , there are some people who remained who were the near cars there
Icyo gihe nge nagiye muri groupe ya mbere oscar we yarasigaye . ||| That time I entered in the first group and Oscar remained
Iyindi groupe ya kabiri bagarutse kuyifata nabwo arasigara kukberako imyanya yari yabaye mikeya . ||| They came back for the second group but he was left because there was n't enough room
Mucyo arashaka kugira icyo avuga . ||| Would Mucyo like to say something ?
Nge nagirango nagirango mvuge aho twatandukaniye nuriya muvandimwe ubwo abandi bazavuga nyuma yaho . ||| I wanted to talk about where I parted with that comrade , so the rest will speak after
Ubwo bimaze kumera nabi bamaze kwica umuryango wa kayige . ||| It became bad after they killed Kayije 's family
Harabanje hagenda koko groupe ya mbere turasigara . ||| The first group left and we remained behind
Dusigaye imodoka iragaruka , igarutse yaraje uwarurimo ahamagara ose murumuna wa josue ......... ||| The car came back , the person in it asked for Ose the brother to Joshua
Ati ose ari hehe?icyo gihe oscari twari twegeranye . ||| That "@ where is Ose ? @" I was next to Oscar that time
Mbwira oscari nti urabona nitwe twari dusigaye none imodoka iragarutse niyo occasion dufite . ||| I told Oscar that we are the ones who were now he car is back , this is our chance
Yo kugenda kuko aha ngaha baraza kuhatera kandi koko byaragaragaraga . ||| To go because this place will be attacked and it was clear that this would happen
Kuko interahamwe zacaga epfo twabaga tuzireba mu ma kamyo bose badutunga urutoki . ||| Because the Interahamwe were passing below where we were in trucks pointing at us
Kandi n' abantu bose bariho basimbuka bava kwa bagwa kwa makuza kuko byaragaraga ko bari buze kuhatera . ||| And everyone was jumping over Mukuza 's which showed that they were going to attack the place
Ndamubwira nti iyi niyo occasion tubonye yo guhunga jya tugende . ||| I told him this is our chance to escape come and we go
Arajijinganya kandi byari ibintu byo kwihuta kuko ubwo abantu bose bari bamanutse biruka uvuga uti ni imodoka imwe igarutse yonyine . ||| He delayed and yet this needed to be done fast because everyone was running saying that it was only one car that had returned
Interahamwe zacaga mu muhanda epfo hari iziri mu ma camionette hari amakamyo atwaye imirambo . ||| The Interahamwe were passing downwards there were some in lorries and there were trucks carrying dead bodies
Cyane cyane abagendaga bavuza amafirimbi batunga urutoki aho kwa makuza . ||| Particularly they kept on bowing their whistles and pointing fingers at Makuza 's
Ikindi abantu batangiye kuvuga ko abo muri kanzayire babica bagasimbuka urugo bakagwa kwa makuza . ||| Also people started saying that those from Kanzayire are being killed so people are jumping over the fence to Mukuza 's
Tuza guhagararana na oscar ndamubwira nti oscar urabireba byarangiye . ||| I stood with him and then told him "@ you see
Barataka aha ngaha dushake ukuntu tuhava . ||| They are going to attack this place we should look for a way to leave
Abandi baragiye bashobora kutagaruka twe turasigaye . ||| Others have left and might not come back and we left here @"
Tuti dushake ukuntu twahava nibwo twahuye imodoka igarutse rero . ||| That we should look for a way to leave and that we met the car coming back
Igarutse ubwo bavuze bati ose abantu bamanuka bari benshi kugirango bajye kuyijyamo . ||| When it came back and said Ose people sloped in big numbers so that they could get in
Ndababwira nti oscar iyi ngiyi niyo chance yacu niba abantu badutanzemo ntago tubasha kugenda . ||| And I Oscar that this is our only chance , if people get in before us we will not be able to leave
Arajijinganya , ajijinganyije nge mba nagiye ndibukako twageze mu muryango hagati ndongera ndahindukira ndamubwira nti oscar wowe urasigaye . ||| He fumbled around and I left , I remember at the door way and I turned around again and said , Oscar you are staying here
Arambwira ati aho ugiye urahizeye ? ||| And he told , "@ do you trust where you are going @"
Ndamubwira nti ese aha ho urabona uhizeye ? ||| And I told him that , do you trust this place here ?
Ariko mugihe akivuga gutyo abo bantu bose baba baraje . ||| But after he said everyone else came
Nibwo ambwiye ati nge ndagiye igendere nubaho ubeho nanjye nimbaho mbeho . ||| That 's when he told me "@ for me I 'm leaving so you should go and if you live then you live and if I live then I live @"
Aho yari iturutse yari igiye kubarengera ? Yari bwoko ki?yari iya gisirikari?yari iy' umuvandimwe yari iyi iki§ ||| Where it was coming from was it supporting you ? What kind was it ? Was it from the army ? Was it for a relative , what was it ?
Kari agasuzuzuki ariko makuza sinzi niba ari ahangaha ahari we yabimenya . ||| It was a Suzuki but Makuza would know better
Ariko kari agasuzuki kuko hagiye ibyiciro bibiri imodoka zaragiye ari nyinshi za makuza ariko kagarutse kari agasuzuki . ||| However it was a Suzuki because two groups were taken and many of Makuza 's cars were taken but what came back was a Suzuki
Ngirango hari undi mutangabuhamya twabonye kdi nawe ushobora kuduha za precisions wari umukozi wamucyo nawe nyakubahwa president mwamuha ijambo . ||| I think is some else who can give a more detailed account , so honourable president can you give Mucyo 's employee permission to speak
Ngewe nitwa udahemuka silivani ubu ntuye ku kimihurura ||| I am called Udahemuka Silivani and I live in Kimihurura
Hanyuma rero uraza urahireko ibyo ugiye kuvuga ari ukuri . ||| So you should swear that you are going to say is the truth
Ngewe udahemuka sirivani ntanzeho Imana ho umugabo ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri . ||| I Udahemuka Sirivani swear that what I am going to say is the truth
Ngewe ubuhamya ngiye gutanga uyu mugabo mucyo jean de dieu . ||| The testimony I am going to give is that what this man Mucyo Jean Dieu
Nukuvuga ngo ibintu byabereye muri iyi quartier nkuko nawe yabivuze mbere ya jenocide ho gato . ||| I could say that what happened this neighbourhood as he said before the slightly genocide
Byabaye tureba . ||| Happened as we were watching
Njye n' umugabo prosper twabanagayo . ||| Me and a man named Prosper lived there together
Ibyo mucyo yagiye atubwira turi kumwe nawe aho ngaho . ||| And what Mucyo told us as were together there
Barimo bashaka gukora ubwo bw' icanyi twabivuganagaho nawe . ||| As they tried to commit the killings we talked about it together
Kuko muri iryo joro habyarimana apfuye yaduteranyirije muri salo . ||| Because the night Habyarimana died he called us together in the sitting room
Aratubwira ati dukore iki twahise twambara imyenda umuntu yari ashoboye gushyira k' umubiri ako kanya . ||| And told us what to do and we immediately dressed up in what we could wear at that time
Iby' izo modokari zazaga kuberako uko nabisobanuye niko nabibonaga ndi kumwe nuwo prosper . ||| About those car that came , because I could only describe what I saw I agree with Prosper
Kugeza ubwo we ahavuye ari deplacant ajya kwa makuza mpasigarana nuwo mugabo prosper twari kumwe . ||| Up to when he left being transported and went to Mukuza 's I remained with that man Prosper with whom we were together
Igipangu baracyataka isa munani turimo abo bantu bari bafite amagrenade . ||| They attacked the house at 2 0'clock while were there and those people had grenades
Amashoka , amahiri ngewe na prosper ubwo twihindiye mukazu kari kari murugo . ||| ..................... me and Prosper hid in a small room
K' ikikoni kari ak' amatafari . ||| On the fence it was made of bricks
Amatafari twaraciyemo ikintu ..... twinjiramo tubonye batatse urupangu . ||| We cut through the bricks and entered when we saw attacking our home
Hari hariho ibiti hejuru tugerekaho amatafari tujyamo . ||| There were something up and we put bricks on top and entered
Bamaze kwinjira mugipangu hari imodokari yuyu mugabo mucyo jean de dieu . ||| When they entered the compound and there was the car of this man Jean de Dieu
Ya ........... ariko ubwo munzu telephone niko ziri gusona zisona bakavuga ngo byanze bikunze aba bantu barimo . ||| and in the house the phone was ringing and they said without doubt these people are in this house
Inzugi baba baraziciye binjira ahari umuryango kwa oscar bateramo grenade . ||| They tore the doors down and entered Oscar 's place where they threw a grenade
Twe turebera muri ayo matafari ntawashoboraga kuzamuka ngo arebe hanze neza . ||| We could look through a breach between the bricks and look outside .
Nasabaga yuko wakunganira cyane wenda ibyo yavuze wenda nibyo abandi bavuze noneho ukareba ibyo wakongeraho wowe . ||| I would like you elaborate properly with maybe what he said or what others said and then see what you can add on
Cyane icyo nagombaga kunganiraho uyu mugabo nuko urupfu rwuwo mugabo witwa oscar nubwo twe twari hariya . ||| What I wanted to elaborate on was that when this man Oscar died we were around although
Ntabwo natwe twamenye urupfu rwe nkuko uriya mugabo prosper yabivuze twari kumwe nuwo mukecuru munzu . ||| We did not know how he died , as that man Prosper said we were together with the other old lady in the house
Uyu mugabo witwa etienne amaze kudutererana akatubwira ati mwashatse ahantu mujya mukava hano . ||| After this man Etienne betrayed us and told us to look for a place to go and leave
Kwa etienne byagenze gute mwari mwahahungiye ? ||| What happened at Etienne 's place , had you sought refuge in that place ?
Twebwe haje gushya kwa mucyo bigeze k' umugoroba wa joro hari hamaze gushya neza . ||| Mucyo 's place was burnt and by evening it was properly burnt
Tukabona abantu baraza kuhasura sura cyane kandi twari tukiri muri iyo nzu . ||| And we saw people coming to loot while were still that house
Noneho nijye wabwiye prosper nti aha hantu urabona barimo baraza kuhasurasura cyane . ||| I told Prosper that this place is being looted a lot
Itonde etienne yarabatereranye ate wabisobanura ? ||| "@ Hold on Etienne betrayed them and can you can you explain yourself to them ? @"
Etienne ubwo twabonye ijoro riguye tujya iwe dushaka kugirango tumukomangire tubona burije cyane . ||| When night fell and we went to his place hoping to knock at his door because it was dark
.... Hafi aho hari abantu bashobora kuba batugirira nabi . ||| .... close by there were people who could harm us
Mwagiye iwe ? ||| Did you go to his place ?
Twagiye iwe twanga kubakomangira .... Munsi y' ikamyoneti yapfuye idakora . ||| We went to his place but decided not to knock at his door....under a rundown truck
Tubonye bukeye murukerera nibwo tubakomangiye . ||| When we saw it was morning that 's when we knocked at their door
Madamu we n' umukobwa we bari bahari baratwakira badushyira mu ka annexe kegeranye na ws inyuma . ||| His wife and daughter were around and they covered us and put us in the boys quarters near the toilet behind
Yeeeeeeeee nagirango nuvuga madamu cyangwa umukobza uze kuvuga amazina ye niba uyibuka . ||| I would like you to give the names of his wife and daughter if you remember them
Ntabwo nyibuka neza ndumva hari abantu bashobora kuba banyunganira bakayambwira . ||| I do not remember them very well but I feel people who can help me and tell me
Ubwo umudamu yatuzaniye na kacyayi aratubwira ati ntabwo twari tuziko rwose hariya hantu mwari murimo tuti niho twari turi etienne ntiyari ahari . ||| The wife brought us some tea and told us that they did not know that where we there and we said that we were , Etienne was not around
Ubwo mukanya gato etienne aba araje arahadusanze baramubwiye bati hari abahungu babanaga na mucyo . ||| I short while Etienne came and found us there , they told him there are some boys who live with Mucyo
Yinjira munzu ...... ariko aho asohokeye twe twarabibonye ko dufite ikintu tumubangamiye . ||| He entered the house....but when he got out we could already see that we were an inconvenience
Ubwo nibwo nabwiye muginzi wanjye twari turi kumwe muri ako ka annexe . ||| That 's when I told my friend with whom we were together in that small boys quarters
Ndamubwira nti uyu mugabo urabona ko dushobora kuba turi aha tugahura n' ibibazo kuberako ntabushobozi tugifite bwo kuba tukiri kumwe nawe hano . ||| That this man you can see might make us encounter problems here because we have no right to be here with him
Nabimubwiye muri annexe aho nari ndi ubwo prosper yarasohotse muri ako ka annexe ahamagara umukecuru wari uturanye nuwo mugabo etienne . ||| After telling him this Prosper got out of that boys quarter that we were in and called the old women who lived next to Etienne
Umukecuru kandi araha ashobora guhaguruka ndumva ntazi izina rye neza . ||| The old woman could get up , I do not remember her name
Sinkiryibuka hashize igihe . ||| I do not remember it , it 's been a while
Umukecuru twiyambaje etienne amaze kudutererana umukecuru tumubwira ikibazo dufite aratubwira ati . ||| "@ old lady we have asked for assistance from Etienne and he has betrayed us @" we told the old lady the problem we had
Nimuze mube muri hano nta kibazo . ||| "@ come and live here there is no problem @" she said
Aho hantu twarahabaye kugeza igihe umuntu abonye ko dusigaye muri quartier twenyine ntabandi bantu bagihari . ||| We stayed there until someone noticed that we were the only ones left in the neighbourhood
Yiyambaza umuntu sinzi niba ari mwenewabo sinzi niba ari umuntu w' inshuti sinzi . ||| I do n't know if that person was a relative , I do n't know if it was a friend
Yitwaga augustin yari chef d' etat major wa jandarumori . ||| He was called Augustin , he was the chief of staff of Gendarmerie
Kugirango amudeplace n' umuryango we umukecuru ariko aratubwirango namwe ntabwo nshobra kubasiga . ||| He wanted to shift the old lady and her family but he said he could not leave us behind
Ubwo twarahungaye bansize i gitarama nkuko prosper yabivuze ariko we barakomezanyije . ||| We fled together and they left me in Gitarama as Prosper said but they continued together with him
Ikindi nshobora kuba nongeraho kubyerekeye umugabo oscar wari uturanye nuyu mugabo . ||| Another thing that I can add concerning the man Oscar who lived next to this man
Njyewe ubwange nkiri kuri uriya mudamu twari munzu ngewe na prosper ntabwo twageraga hanze . ||| I personally when I was still with Prosper that woman 's house we never left the house
Ariko abantu bahitaga aho hanze b' interahamwe biruka ngo bajye kwica abantu bahise haruguru yurwo rugo . ||| But people passed outside who Interahamwe running that they were going to kill people and passed above that house
Numvise bavugango uriya mugabo ngo w' amaguru maremare ngo wari utuye haruguru aha ngo twamushyize mu cyobo kiri hariya . ||| I heard them say "@ that man with long legs who lived above here , we put him in a hole over there
Munsi yo kwa pasteur ngo umwe wari uturanye na wa mugabo ngo w' igikara ari we uyu mucyo yohani bashatse kuvuga . ||| Blow the pastor 's place , " that the one who lived with the dark skinned man , and it is this Mucyo Jonah who they were talking about
Ariwe na oscar bishe nabyumvise ndi kuri uriya mukecuru ariko ntabwo nari ndi ahagaragara . ||| It was Oscar they had killed , when I eaves dropped on what they were saying as hid at the old lady 's place
Abo bagendaga ntabwo wababonye ? ||| Did you see where they were going ?
Njye narindi munzu umuntu nabibwiyeho ni prosper naramubwiye nti sha abo bantu bavuga ngo umugabo wamaguru maremare w' ikiyobe ubwo si oscar . ||| I was in the house and the person I told this was Prosper that they are talking about a man with long legs and dark skinned , is n't it Oscar ?
Nti ko numvise bavuze ngo n' umugabo w' igikara babanaga . ||| That I also had them talk about a black man with whom they lived
Nonese oscar niwe twahoze tuvuga yeeeeeeeeee ruzagiriza . ||| Is it Oscar we were talking about , yes Ruzagirizi
Mbega ibyo nashoboye kumva nibyo nashoboye gukurikirana nibyo . ||| What I was able to here and follow up is that
Waba uretse hari abifuza kukubaza kubyo uvuze . ||| You may stop there , there are some people who have questions on what you were talking about
aje hashize nk' iminota nka cumi n' itanu yamenyeko duhari yikojeje inyuma y' inzu arongera yikoza munzu . ||| When he came after around 15 minutes he knew that we were around and he jumped behind the house and then into the house
Noneho arahadusanga kuko yari atuzi aratubwira ati mu mbabarire muve hano murebe ahantu mujya cyangwa se murebe ukundi mubigenza . ||| And found us there and because he knew us he told us that help me and leave this place and find a place to go or something
Naho nje nuriya mugabo prosper niho twafatiye umwanzuro . ||| And that when me and the man Prosper came to a decision
N' umwana wakoreraga uwo mugabo witwa oscar kuko nawe twari kumwe aho ngaho hariya . ||| And the youngster who worked for the man Oscar because we were together
Ari hehe ? ||| Where is he ?
We baje gutera igisasu hafi yuru rugo rw' uyu mukecuru mubantu bari bahahungiye biruka yirukankamo ahita agenda . ||| They shot near the house of this old lady and the people who fled . they run away and he also left

Ntago ari umwanya wo gutanga ubuhamya gusa nsa nuzi ibintu birengejeho kubyo bavuze . ||| This is n't the time to only give testimony is it ? I have more information on what they have talked about

Twatabaje minuar baza muri za shari z' umweru nibo bahabavanye agata afata ijambo rito twagiramungu afata ijambo rito . ||| We solicited for help from UNAMIR and they arrived in white cars . They are the ones who took them away after both of them [ Twagiramungu and Agatha ] had given short speeches
Nanjye mfata ijambo ndavuga nti MRND irategura ubwicanyi simusiga buzamara abanyarwanda . ||| I gave a speech and said that , MRND is organising mass murder of Rwandese .
Niryo jambo rya nyuma navuze byanyuze kuri radio rwanda abarishaka barisangaho bagomba kuba bararifashe . ||| That 's the last word I said that passed on radio Rwanda . Those in need of it can find it there { radio Rwanda } they must have recorded it .
Kuko narimfite mukuru wanjye wiga muri univeriste witwa ... yambwiye ko yaryumvise ndetse akava muri univeriste uwo munsi ntaharare . ||| I had a brother at the University called ... who told me that he had what I said and actually he left the University that day and did not sleep there .

Bategura rero kwihorera icyabaye icyo gihe nuko hari abantu bari basanganywe bafite kuri liste bagomba kwica mu kwica .. ||| They organised revenge of what happened then . They had a list of people who they 'd planned to kill during the killing .
Ubwo bari batarashyiramo abanyapolitiki b' itariki ya gatandatu ni joro . ||| By then they had not included politicians of the night of 6th .

Ku itari 22/02/1994 icyo gihe rero wenda nari mubambere bagombaga gupfa . ||| Maybe On 22/02/1994 , I was supposed to be the first person killed .
Nagatera karipoforo ndavuga aho dutuye sinarinzi ko gatera ariho ariko yari asanzwe yikomwe kuko bari baramuciriye urubanza rwo gupfa . ||| even Gatera Karipoforo , I can say that I did not know Gatera was alive , he has already been sentenced to death
Bamurega ngo ko yaraye arasa mu mugi ikigali we n' uwitwa rwigema n' abandi . ||| claiming that him and Rwigema spent the night shooting in Kigali town
Ugashyiraho kuma urukiko rwa gisirikari rubakatira imanza rubarenganya ariko . ||| Also include the fact that the Military Tribunal decided their cases with partiality
Ibyo biri imbere ho gatoya icyo gihe rero mfite murumuna wanjye wari utuye i remera ....... Yari ari ku kiriyo kwagatabazi yarayeyo . ||| Before that I had a brother who lived in Remera and had spent the night at Gatabazi 's last funeral rights

Hari uko bavugaga abantu bakabamenya . ||| they is a way they said and you got what they want to imply
Bavugagako baza kunyica saa tanu zuzuye . ||| Safari they were saying that they are coming to kill me at exactly 11:00
Nagirango nutanga ubuhamya kuberako turashaka kumenya ukuri kuri jenocide abo bantu nutabavuga ... ||| because we are interested in knowing the truth about the genocide , I want you to reveal their names
Abo bantu simbazi amazina ariko yarambwiye ngo bavugaga igikiga . ||| I do n't know the names of those people , but he { my brother } told me they were speaking "@ urukiga @"
Nifuzaga yuko abantu uzi wabavuga?kubera yuko n' urugero rwiza . ||| my wish is for you to spell out the names you know , because it is a good example
Kubera yuko abaturage nibumva yuko bagomba kuvuga basimbutse amazina byaba ari ikibazo ntabwo twagera kukuri . ||| because if others testify while not revelling the names , it will be a problem as we shall not get to the truth
Ntabwo yambwiye amazina ariko yarambwiye ngo bavugaga igikiga . ||| he did n't tell me their names but he told me that they were speaking "@ urukiga @"
Bari aho kwa gatabazi bavuga ngo baraza kunyica saa tanu ahita ahaguruka . ||| Safari they were there at Gatabazi 's saying that they are going to kill me at 11:00 and he stood up
Afata ijipe y' umweru ya benz yari afite araza murugo asanga nicaye murugo . ||| he went into his white Mercedes jeep he owned and found me seated at home
Arambwira ati urapfa saa tanu ubwo hari nka saa mbiri na makumyabiri ubwo twahise tuvugana na nyakubahwa mucyo . ||| Safari
Nti saa tanu ati saa tanu nti ubifitiye gihamya ati barakwica saa tanu niko nkubwiye . ||| Safari At 11:00 ? and he answered , "@ at 11:00 @" I asked whether he has proof of what he was saying and he said "@ I 've told you you 'll be killed at 11:00 @"
Mbura uko ngira ndacanganyukirwa nti ngire nte ati hunga nti mpungire he ati ntabwo mpazi . ||| I ran out of ideas and became very confused asking myself what I can do . And he told me , "@ flee @"@ . ‘ Where can I go ? ’ I asked , " I do n't know @" he answered
Ndibuka icyo gihe yarambajije ati ufite amafaranga mbaza umugore nti ufite amafaranga .... Nti yazane abana bose bari bakiri murugo . ||| I remember he asked me whether I had some money and I asked my wife , "@ do you have money ? @" I told her to give it to me . All the children were at home .
Abakobwa bange n' abahungu bange tunyarukira iwe i remera aduha andi mafaranga yiyongeraho . ||| my daughters and sons ran to his place in Remera and he gave us more money
Nibaza aho ndi buhungire agatima karaza kati jya iwanyu . ||| I asked myself where I will flee to and my heart told me to go to my place of birth
Nibaza aho ndibunyure setiba yafunze kugiti cy' inyoni noneho kuberako nari maze igihe ngenda mubaturage ba kimisange . ||| I was wondering where I will pass ? What if "@ kugiti cy'inyoni @" is locked and I 'm known by the people of Kimisange ?
Ndwanya MRND ngaruka ino nzamuka hano haruguru hafi ya rebero nca muri kariyeri ngaruka kimisange . ||| I fought MRND and came back here climbing there at the top next to Rebero and passed through Kariyeri and I came back to Kamisange
Safari nagirango tumenye neza niba ari ubuhamya utanga cyangwa se uzabuduhe ubundi . ||| Safari , can you clarify to us whether you are testifying or you give your testimony next time
Niba ari ukunganira abantu nagirango ubivuge mu magambo make . ||| if you are supplementing on what other people said , do so in summary
Nubundi nyakubahwa president navuzeko nzabutanga buri naburebure wumviseko nzi ibintu byinshi . ||| your Honour I 'd said that I will give a long testimony because you can see that I know a lot of things
Noneho icyo gihe nibwo twaterwaga amaze kubibwira ndahunga . ||| it is then that we were attacked after he told me , I fled
Nca ayo mayira nababwiraga mpinguka hariya munsi ya ..... ndambuka . ||| I passed through the same paths I told you earlier , to that place under that .... and crossed
Nyuma baratera koko nkuko yakabimbwiye baza iwanjye barasenya bamenagura ibirahure . ||| Later they indeed attacked as he had warned me . they came home and destroyed and they broke windows
Baragenda bajya kwa gatera bakorayo amarorerwa umwana witwa gloriose wari uhari njya mbona akunda kuza hano . ||| They went to Gatera 's and raped one Gloriose , I normally see her around .
Azavuga uko byagenze icyo nashakaga kuvuga rero nuko icyo gihe bisa naho twatewe n' abantu batoranijwe hano igikondo . ||| she will tell you what happened , what I wanted was to tell you was that at that time we were attacked by people selected from here , Gikondo .
Uwo namenyemo ngarutse n' uwitwa fupi mwene gakara naje no kugira ntya ndamubona n' amaso yanjye . ||| I later learnt that Fupi son of Gakara was among the assailants . in fact I one time met him
Yari muri icyo gitero . ||| he was among the assailants
Fupi mwaba muzi ayandi mazina ye ? ||| Do you know his other name ?
Se ni gakara . ||| Could it be Gakara ,
Wari utuye hehe ? ||| Where did you live ?
Hano hirya hafi yaho bita salo aha inyuma abanyagikondo bose barahazi abo mwicaranye bose barahazi . ||| Close to here at a place called Salo , behind here , all residents of Gikondo know it , all those you are seated know it
Abantu bari muri icyo gitero nibo nashoboye kumenyamo ........ ||| I knew only those who were among the attackers
Abantu mirongo itanu n' abatatu twabarako bapfuye murwego rwa jenocide . ||| I could say 53 people died in the genocide
Hari igihe tuvuga abo muri mirongo icyenda na Kane tukabagira nabo bandi bapfuye . ||| There a times we refer to the people of 1994 together with those who died
Nagirango usobanure wavugako bazize jenocide ubisobanure neza . ||| You said that they were victims of the genocide , I would like you to explain this
Bazize jenocide kuko nziko icyo gihe nubwo ubundi byitwaga guhorera bucyana ariko bucyana yari SDR . ||| they were victims of Genocide because I know that despite the fact that they called it revenging Bucyana , but Bucyana was a SDR
SDR ryari ishyaka ryikoma abatutsi kumugaragaro rivangura icyo gihe bishe abatutsi . ||| CDR was a political party that openly hated Tutsis with divisionism , they killed Tutsis then
Bateye abantu batavuga rumwe barwanya ibitekerezo bya SDR bayirwanya batavuga rumwe na hutu pawa . ||| they attacked people who did not share the same ideology with CDR fighting those
N' abatutsi bamwe na bamwe amazina yabapfuye muyarebye mwabibona . ||| And some Tutsis , if check the names of the dead you will see this
Tugeze rero ubwo wenda nsimbuke aho ngaho kugihe habyarimana apfa . ||| When w ego there , I should skip the part when Habyarimana died
Habyarimana apfa narabimenye nabwo hari nka saa tatu z' ijoro . ||| Habyarimana died and I found out around 9 pm
Jya kwa gatera karipoforo ndamubwira nti wamenye ibyabaye ati ntabwo nabimenye . ||| I went to Gatera Karopoforo 's and asked him if he knew what happened and he said he did not
Ati bite nti indege barayihanuye ati none duhunge duhungire he nti ndumva twaca ibutamwa tukagera mubugesera . ||| That the plane was shot down , "@ we should we flee to ? @" he asked and I said we could pass Butamwa up to Bugesera
Kubera iki mfite isambu hariya numvaga abaturage batwambutsa mu mazi . ||| Because I have a land there and I felt the locals could help us cross over the lake
Niko nibazaga icyo gihe ati muri ikigicuku aribaza ati tujye kureba kayije . ||| That 's what I thought at that time and he wondered whether we should go and see Kayije in the middle of the night
Turazamuka tubyutsa kayije turavuga tunanirwa gufata icyemezo mugitondo nibwo radio yatanze itegeko ngo nta muntu ugomba kuva ahari . ||| I climbed up and woke Kayije up and talked but failed to come to a decision . In the morning there was a law passed on radio that no one should leave where he is
Duhera mu mazu dutyo tumaze guhera mu mazu rero mu ma saa tanu itariki indwi umudamu w' indera araza . ||| We stayed in the house and at 11 o'clock on the 7th a woman from Ndera came
W' umuryango w' inshuti yanjye mukarucogoza aranterefona ati nagirango ngusezereho nti se kubera iki ? ||| She was from the family of a friend of mine Mukarucogoza and she said wanted to say bye and I asked why
Ati noneho ubanza uri bupfe nti ese nzira iki ati urapfa ati kuko maze kumenyako shamukiga bamwishe . ||| That you might die , "@ what have I done ? @" I asked "@ you 'll die because I just found out that Shamukiga was killed @" she answered
Gutyo nti ubibwiwe nande ati n' umwana wanjye uri mu mugi . ||| "@ who told you that ? @" I asked "@ by my child in town @" she answered
Ntangira kumva noneho ubwoba bwiyongereye nibwo nibwiraga kujya kwihisha kwa kayija . ||| I started to feel more scared and I told myself to hide at Kayije 's
....... Umugore arambwira ati turajya kwa kayije ni kure urabona guca imbere y' iwanjye ukagera imbere yo kwa kayije . ||| ...... the woman told me "@ going to Kayije 's , is far you see passing in front of my place up to in front of Kayije 's
..... ho sinaharota ..... cloture yari ihari nawe yarahigwaga sinashoboraga kuba najyayo . ||| I can not dream of it @"@ ... the fence was there and he was also being sought after and I could not go there
Kugeza ubwo nkumva abo numva duhuje ibibazo aribo nahungiraho . ||| Up to when I felt those with whom we shared a problem were the ones I could flee to
Ntekereza noneho kujya kwa mucyo nashoboraga kujya kwa twagiramungu twari duturanye . ||| I decided to go to Mucyo , I could go Twagiramungu 's with whom we were neighbours
Ariko sinigeze mbitekereza noneho niko guhungira rero kwa mucyo ngezeyo rero baje kurasa . ||| But I never thought about it , and that 's when I fled to Mucyo 's
Ndabyibuka icyo gihe aterefona i nyamirambo amarira amubunga mu maso . ||| I remember he the time he called Nyamirambo tears filling his eyes
Ariko arihangana ntiyarira bamaze kumubwira ko mushiki we na muramu we imirambo yabo irambaraye aho ngaho . ||| But he controlled himself and did not cry after they told him that his sister 's and his in law 's bodies were sprayed there
Nibwo abantu bazaga kurasa urumva rero umuntu bari barampaye ....... Bageraga kunyica inshuro nyinshi . ||| That 's when there were shoot outs......they almost killed many times
Hari nubundi bigeze kuza iwange kumanywa n' abasirikari nabwo kunyica barambura . ||| There is another time when they came to my place during the day with soldiers to kill me but did not find me there
Nibwo nuriraga nyine ndagenda twihisha murubingo ngirango naba oscar ariko ntabwo twahunganye . ||| That 's when I climbed while hiding in bushes , I think with the Oscars but we did not flee together
Ariko ntabwo twabunze hamwe bamwe babundaga ukwabo abandi ukwabo . ||| But we did not flee to the same place , some gathered together and others did the same
Babunze murubingo .......... Wose mbunda murubingo abana baraza barankurikira baraza turabunda . ||| They fled to the bushes.....they gathered in the bushes and the children followed me and we gathered there
Noneho bigeze mu kabwibwi mbona umuntu uvanyeho Rideau . ||| In the evening I saw someone draw the curtain
Niwe wamwana yahoze avuga umuzungu avanaho Rideau ndagenda ni .... N' abana umuzungu ati ....... Nti ntabwo tuva munzu . ||| That 's what the other youngster said , a White man drew the curtain and I went...and the children and the White man said that we should not leave the house
Aterefona musenyeri ati witwa nde ndamwibwira ati hari umuntu witwa safari uje kwihisha hano mbigenze nte ? ||| He called the Msgr and asked "@ what 's your name ? @" I told him and he said "@ there is someone called Safari who has come to seek refuge here what should I do ? @"
Ruhumuriza ati baramuka bamenyeko yahageze byo byonyine barakwica . ||| Ruhumuriza said that if they find out that he is a round they will kill you
Kuko bari kumuhiga cyane ati Ibyiza nuko ....... Ntibazabimenye cyangwa bakazabicana . ||| Because they are hunting for him a lot and that it would be good....they should not find out or else they will kill you along with them
Kuko nubundi nunamwirukana niho hahandi....nuko rero twabaye kuri uwo mugabo tutari tuziranye n' abana ntabwo bari baziranye nkuko uriya mwana yabiketse . ||| Because even if you send him away it 's the same thing....so we stayed at that man 's place without knowing each other and children not also acquainted as that child said
Ahubwo kera n' Imana ya nyoboyeyo........agacupa na murenzi tukamanuka tuganira umutima ukambwira . ||| I think it was God who led me there....a bag , and Murenzi sloping conversing and my heart told me
Uzihishe hariya nabonaga ikizu kinini kiri inyuma ye ariko siho nihishe nihishe kuri uwo . ||| You should hide there , I could see a big house behind but that 's not where I hid , I had at that one 's place
Kugeza rero ubwo mpakiriye mubyukuri nuko byagenze icyo najyaga gusobanura nuko le 07 . ||| Up to when I survived , honestly that is what happened , what I want to explain is that on the 7th
Itariki makumyabiri nebyiri ......... mbese naratunguwe saa yine ngo urapfa saa tanu kandi ni wowe uri bupfe . ||| The 12th .... I was surprised at 10 that you are going to be killed
Icyo gihe baraje batera isahinda ariko nta muntu bishe muri quartier . ||| They attacked at another time but no one in the area was killed
Ngirango iyo bambona bari kunyica niyo babona karipoforo bari kumwica . ||| I think if they had seen me they would have killed even if they had seen Karipoforo they would have killed him
Nicyo bari bagambiriye uwo ku itariki 22/02 nyuma yizo Tariki byo byari ibindi rero . ||| That what they had planned on the 22nd of February , after that date was a whole different story
Ntabwo barobanuraga baricaga k' umurongo nibyo nashakaga kongeraho gusa . ||| They did not discriminate they killed in row , that all I wanted to add
Icyo nashaka gusobanura nuko uwo muzungu tutari tuziranye ari Imana yanyoboyeyo . ||| What I wanted to explain is that that White man and I were not acquainted , it was God who sent me there
Naho umuntu azakirira Imana ikakuyobora ngo jya hariya yaranambwiye ngo njye murusengero ndanga . ||| Where someone accepts God to guide him , he told me to go to church and I refused
Rw' abametodiste bigeze nijoro bateramo grenade . ||| For the Methodists and when night fell they threw a grenade in it
Abantu bapfiramo ndambije muri korodoro arambwira ati wicare muri korodoro urambye . ||| People died in it while I was lying in the corridor and he told me to sit in the corridor with my legs straight
Ndicara ndarambya araza arambwira ati hahandi wanze kujya ufite ukuri barimo barahicira abantu . ||| And I sat and he came and told me that where you refused to go , you were right they are killing people there
Nibyo nashakaga gusa kongera kubuhamya bwerekeranye n' itariki makumyabiri nebyiri . ||| That 's all I wanted , to add on the testimony concerning the date 22nd
N' itariki indwi yonyine y' ukwakane muw' igihumbi Kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na Kane . ||| And the 7th only of April of 1994
Nagirango wasubiramo wasubiramo ibyo ku itariki makumyabiri n' ebyiri . ||| I would like you to repeat what happened on the 22nd
Hari aho mwavuze muti ubwambere nashatse guhungira kwa kayije ariko mbona ari kure . ||| There is a point where you said "@ at first you wanted to flee to Kayije 's but it was far
Nuko nerekeza kwa mucyo wongeraho uti nari nturanye n' umugabo twagiramungu . ||| And I went to Mucyo 's @" and you added "@ I was neighbours with a man called Twagiramungu
Ariko ho ntago nagiyeyo . ||| But I did not go there . @"
Twari duturanye . ||| We were neighbours
Ese nimpamvu ki zabiguteye ? ||| What made you do this ?
Umva yari kumwe na mugenzi none se urumva nari guhungira k' umuntu uri kumwe na mugenzi nziko mugenzi tutakivuga rumwe . ||| Listen , he was with Mugezi so do you think I could seek refuge from a man who was with Mugenzi knowing that we did not agree
Nuko nta kizere narimufitiye kuko narinziko ari muri ..... tutavuga rumwe . ||| did not trust him because he was amongst....people with whom we did not agree
Kandi rero sicyo gusa n' igihe cya bucyana baza kunsenyera . ||| That 's not all , even the time of Bucyana they destroyed my house
Igihe cya bucyana twari dufite amarembo afatanye . ||| During the time Of Bucyana we had gates that were connected
Baza kuntera irye yararifunze sinamenya n' impamvu . ||| During the time Of Bucyana we had gates that were connected
Umva naribajije nti ese none si ukugirango abazaza kunyica batazayobera iwe . ||| I wondered could n't it be that when they come to kill the do not mistake his place for mine
Niko natekereje . ||| That 's what I thought
Hari inyangamugayo zifite ikibazo . ||| There are some men of integrity who have questions
Nagirango nkubaze itariki abantu barasiyeho waba uyizi ? Wavuzeko wumvise abantu barasa kwa gatera . ||| I would like to know the date when they shot the people , do you know it ? You said that you heard them shooting at Gatera 's
Itariki indwi ibyo byo nari ndi kwa cyo ubanza twabacunze ntaho mbese n' itariki ya karindwi z' ukwakane muri mirongo icyenda na Kane . ||| On the 7th , I was at.....it 's like we were watching them , it was the 7th of April 1994
Hari mu ma saa saba wa mugani kuko nyakubahwa mucyo yari afite abantu bacunga . ||| It was around 1 o'clock because honourable Mucyo had people keeping watch
Kuko muterefonnye nti ngiye guhungira iwawe yarambwiye ati ntuce imbere . ||| Because when I called him that I 'm coming to seek refuge at your place and he told that "@ do n't come forward @"
Ati hari abantu bari gucunga noneho impamvu gutwika bari baziko ngo tukiri mu mazu . ||| That there are people watching
Kuko baducungaga ngo bari baziko ntaho twagiye turi mu mazu kuko baducungaga . ||| Because they watched us they thought we had n't gone anywhere and were still in our houses .
Ejobundi niho nabimenye ngiye mukigarama mugutangayo ubuhamya . ||| The day before yesterday is when I came to know this when I went to Kigarama to testify .
Muri gacaca ya kigarama niho namenyeko twagiramungu barinaba mugenzi wanjye duturanye . ||| In the Gacaca court of Kagarama I found out that Twagiramungu who was my colleague who was my neighbour
Ngo bantwikiye ngo baziko ndi muri prafo nge nari ntarabimenya kugeza uwo munsi . ||| Burnt my house because they thought that I was in the ceiling but I did not know that up that day .
None bihuye nibyo babwiye nyakubahwa mucyo . ||| Now it 's similar to what they told honourable Mucyo
Nibyo nashakaga kongeraho igihe cyo gutanga ubuhamya bwange nzabutanga burambuye . ||| That 's what I wanted to add , when the time comes to give my testimony , I will give a detailed account
Yeeeeeeee tuzabahamagara kugirango mutange ubuhamya burambuye . ||| Yes we shall call you so that give a detailed testimony .
