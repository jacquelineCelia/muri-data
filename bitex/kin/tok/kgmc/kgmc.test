Yego , njyewe narabibonaga kubera yuko urebye , ibyo ari byo byose twari tuzi amakuru y' ahantu abavandimwe bajyaga , kuko hari n' abavandimwe bavaga za bugesera bakajya mu gisirikare cy' inkotanyi . Noneho nk' umu .. Nka famille ifite umwana wagiye mu nkotanyi watorotse ugasanga barayigendaho . Ugasanga baravuga ngo umuntu afite inkotanyi , mu muryango w' uriya muntu afitemo inkotanyi , tugomba kumugendaho ahongaho rero nta muntu utarabibonaga . Ikindi cya kabiri hari i radiyo y' inkotanyi yitwaga Muhabura mu kujya kuyumva tukajya munsi y' igitanda kumvirayo Muhabura , ntawe ushobora kuyishyira hanze ngo uyifungure . Ahongaho rero n' iyo yaba ari umwana umeze ute , yagombaga kubimenya , cyangwa akabaza ati @: "@ ariko tujya kumvira radiyo munsi y' igitanda kandi iyindi...izindi ... iy' urwanda tuyumvira hanze ? Ubwo rero ugaheraho abantu bakubwira , bakuru bati @: 'dufite ibibazo ibi n' ibi , 'ukabyumva . Wakumva wenda nka ya morare inkotanyi zashyiragaho uti ariko aba Bantu [ n' umwana mutoya ] muba mwishimiye bite ? Ukajya kumva bati n' abana bacu iyo bari aho mu nkotanyi .

Umuntu wabaga yaragiye mu nkotanyi cyangwa famille ifite umuntu wagiye mu nkotanyi cyangwa bikaviramo intandaro yo kwanga abantu bose b' abatutsi kuko bakeka ko ari inkotanyi , icyo gihe ho ntibanatwitaga inkotanyi batwitaga inzoka , ni uko byari bimeze . ||| Yes I could tell , because we knew where our relatives used to go ; some relatives from Bugesera joined Inkotanyi . For example if some one escaped his family and joined Inkotanyi , that family would be in trouble . His family would be spied all the time . They could say , that person 's family has Inkotanyi . Therefore , we should keep an eye on his family . Everybody could see what was taking place . Secondly , there was a radio called ‘ Muhabura ’ which was under the supervision of the Inkotanyi . One had to hide under the bed in order to listen to it . And then tune it on . No one could listen to it in public . So , even a young child could know notice what was taking place ; sometimes kids would ask , "@ How come when we want to listen to radio Muhabura we first hide under the bed , while we listen to radio Rwanda in public ? @" then the adults would explain to us that there was a problem and so on . The Inkotanyi used to put a program for boosting people 's morale on the radio and the adults would be very happy . So , one [ a child ] could ask , "@ How come you become happy while listening to those songs of morale [ hope ] ? @" Then they would answer , "@ There are our children singing with Inkotanyi . @" But our neighbors especially the Hutu neighbors were not happy at all . For example , if there was a person who joined the Inkotanyi , or a family whose member joined the Inkotanyi , that was reason enough to hate the entire clan [ Tutsi ] because they used to say that all Tutsi were Inkotanyi . In fact , by then we were no longer called Inkotanyi , we were called ‘ snakes ' . That is how bad things used to be .

I remember it was in 1991 ... between the year 1991 and 1992 . I was coming from grazing the cattle , I remember I had fought with Nshaka 's kids who were also looking after cows . When he asked me why I fought with them , I told him they had hit a cow with a stick in the ears . And when they hurt the cow , I had to fight them . We never used to hit cows ; we would just caress them while saying soft words and the cow would go where you want it to go . We never used to beat them because almost all cows were peaceful . So , when I faught and after telling grandpa all that , he decided to tell me all about his past . I did n't know it then . He gave me another example of how one time they came to loot them and they refused to live the house . The same Nshaka was leading thea group of attachers and when they reached our home ... I guess he told me that it was in the year 1973 ; they came to my grandpa 's house , grandpa told them that he was not going to leave the house . "@ Maybe you burn me inside @"@ , he told them . Therefore , they took away cows and his harvest since he had refused to get out of the house . They did not burnt him , they just left him there in the house and took everything . From then , I started developing hatred towards them . I started hating even the people who were looking after his cows . I would n't want to come close to them and whenever I would see their cows , I would feel like hitting them to death .

And when thing are like that , you just try to ignore it all . Because if you can not find a way to ignore it , you might end up on the streets , crazy . This would only contribute to making happy your enemies . But when you try to be still and not let even a single person know what you are thinking about . You just have to calm down and think about the future . We only know the past ; we do n't know the future . We can only wait for the future , if it happens to be good , fine ; if not too bad .

I would always take some to her before I would take them to the soldiers . They ended up killing her two days before we left the place . In that area the Inkotanyi had blocked the roads used for taking food to the soldiers in the camp . When they realized they could no longer get any food or bullets delivery , they decided to leave . The following day , we spent the whole day without hearing any shooting until 8:00 p.m when they told us to leave . As we were going the soldier who had taken me with him had a bag full of money . He said he was taking it to Françoise ; I mean the Françoise who lived in Shyorongi . Since he had a gun , he went in front of us then I followed him . We bumped into the Inkotanyis and he was the first one to be shot dead and everyone else was killed . I looked around but I could n't see a single living person , they had all died . Therefore I sat down to try and pull myself down as I did n't even know where I was .

There was a serious problem for the people who were normally living together and then today there is Gacaca of unity and reconciliation . Gacaca can give something that can maybe make people reconcile because in that case there would be telling the truth but me the question I have here , I can say that long ago , people like you who lived in earlier years than ours of today ... Rwandese who practiced it , now I wanted you to try and compare the Gacaca of that time and that of today , do you really think that Gacaca is the solution for Rwandese to such a problem and can they live together like a Rwandan community as a whole again ?
Ni ukuvuga ngo abacitse ku icumu njyewe nihereyeho , njyewe ku bwanjye nashoboye kugira amahirwe yo kubona umugabo ushobora kumpa buri cyose , n' abana nifuzaga .

Njya nshima Imana ko ibyo bintu byabaye ntari kuri volant . ||| About the survivors , let me start by talking about my personal experience . I am lucky to have a husband who gives me anything I want but there 's still nothing that gives me satisfaction here on earth . Nothing ! Be it the car I drive , the house in which I live ... at some point , my husband took me abroad in all the beautiful countries I had dreamt of visiting one day as a child . But it all turned out to be meaningless . I felt like I could have remained the way I had always been , I could have remained poor but with my siblings being with me . Have you ever had things and you have no one to share them with ? I am sharing my own experience . On the other hand , there are some who do not have a comfortable life , there are even others who are suffering from AIDS and who do not have any source of revenue . So I really wonder in what state the person who sleeps hungry is . I have a comfortable life , I never sleep hungry , I can eat anything I want and go anywhere I want whenever I want but I am never happy . I never go for more than a week without locking myself into the room to cry , asking God why my people died , why He allowed my dad to die without seeing my children ... And in my case , I am at ease , so I wonder how things are for those who do not have anything to eat at times . They are rotten , I do n't event think that they truly survived , they are still going through the sufferings , the pain . It 's all still present in their lives . Would say you survived if you were a parent without any child to keep you company ? When you get sick and there 's no one to take care of you , no one to bring for you food and yet you had children ? And the other thing that hurts me so much is that there are some people who believe that one only survived because they killed . But less people think that way today . Others say that if they did n't kill , they would n't have survived . They are killing us again and again whenever they say so ... it 's like driving the knife in the wound all over again ... Because when people ask you how you survived , saying that the fact that you survived shows that you ... that you also killed . They do not know God . You can not kill a people God created and wipe it out . So I am constantly sad , I am a very sorrowful person . Sometimes I am driving and ... there 's a time it happened to me but thanks God I was n't the one driving . I was in a cab and I remembered my people , I remember home , I remembered the way we were living despite the fact that we were poor , I felt like ... it was as though I lost conscience , I was lost ... When we reached the round about , I asked the taxi driver where he was taking me , I asked him where he was taking me since I had told him I was going to the gare ... Everyone was looking at me as if I was a mad woman , then I came back to my senses and realized we were at the round about . I believe I could have done something really bad if I was the one driving and maybe gotten myself into a terrible accident ! I always thank God that it did n't happen while I was driving .
Ubundi iyo umuntu yahuye n' amahano nk' aya , aba afite ikintu yibuka cya kera . We yumva ko kigarutse cyamuha amahoro .

Akaba ari nk' ingaruka y' itsembabwoko . ||| Normally when someone ever faced such scandles , always there is an event or something from his or her past , which he or she remembers and wishes to see again in order to gain peace of mind . For example ; in your marriage life , there were some words that your husband used to say to you and those words made you feel so good . It maybe your children ... the one who died ... or your neighbours . Personally , what do you remember that gives a lot of sorrows more than other things yet it was as a result of the genocide ?

But some times I wonder , I think that is God works ; I always say that if the sorghum plantations were not there , no one would have survived among those who survived in Rubengera .

No , by standing appropriately I do not mean standing that way . ; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity .

My sister realised that her life was also getting worse because she never had any documents [ diplomas or certificates ] . The war began when she was in secondary two . Then she told me , "@ You have reached in senior five and you can see that FARG is helping us ; they provide us with school funds , transport and other school expenses . It is a high time I also went back to school . @" Immediately she started looking for a school and started studying as soon as she got one . FARG continued to help us until 2002 when they [ FARG ] gave us a house in the Kimironko residences , which were constructed for children who live on their own [ orphans ] . We started living in that house . Later FARG was decentralised and they stopped helping people . When they did ... I had finished my studies before they stopped helping us . Then I got a temporary job in Ibuka . I worked and the money was helpful . My sister was actually able to get some of the school material she needed . Then the job stopped and life stopped too .

It was our neighbours , among them was a man called Benoit who had been our neighbour for years and who owned a shop nearby . He was her friend and he even used to lend her money for me to go to school the times she did n't have money . They were relating to each other very well . He was one of the leaders of the group that took them the time they came to kill them . There was another young man called Kanani . She was Kanani 's teacher in primary . Some people inside the compound tried to fight with them as they had been given money by my parents and he 's the one who was holding her hand when they were taking her out of the house ; he later on let go of it . When he released her , my mum ran away but they found her where she had ran too . At least I can still remember that incident very clearly ...

Maybe you will ask @: where did these people come from ? They were people who fled from their homes , some were killed in their homes . Others were found out in the bush near the Rubirizi farm [ there were many cows and a very wide bush ] and then the killers used to bring them here to kill them . They also brought some from the house of the then counselor named Biziyaremye , after the latter had kidnapped them from their homes . Those are the news that ... the victims were transported in pick ups and taken to the Interahamwes who were at Rubirizi . They used to throw people into a big pit after killing them . This pit is very deep . It was dug in order for dead cows to be thrown there . It is about 40 meters long and it was n't dug the usual way . It is so deep that it has n't possible to exhume the bodies of the victims that are inside . We tried digging but we were told they poured acid into it . There are even remains of cows inside ! We tried in vain and the ministry told us we shall build a memorial site there . That way , we will be able to visit the place every year after it 's been built .

They were two aunts and they were living these ends . Therefore , she told them that , "@ keep hiding her , if I get their aunties I will tell them and they will come for them . But continue hiding it from your husband so that you do n't get conflicts together at the last moment . He may even decide to chase her yet she has no where to go . @" then she came and I immediately went home . The man had come back so I went back in Gacaca where I lived . And , that woman too left . And when she came to purchase clothes , she met our aunties and then she told them ; "@ do you know that your two kids survived ... ? @" but thought it was impossible ; "@ is there anyone who survived in Kibuye ... ? @" to them it sounded unusual . But she convinced them , "@ it is true at Kibuye some people survived . They never went to the stadium ; they just hid in the neighbor 's homes ... and today they are alive . @" But they never agreed with her . Therefore , she told them that they should sometime come with her and see where we lived . She told them that one lives at Gatabazi and another one lives at Munyagishari 's home . Munyagishari is the one we lived together and they already knew him . After visiting my sister I returned home and went to school . After two days I went to school but I would come home at 10:00 a.m. as usual . However when she told our aunties about it , they immediately boarded and came over .

Instead local attackers would be deployed in an area where many people had gathered . What does this mean ... ? The Tutsi whom we were neighbours , left there homes and went to Ntarama plus many other people who had come from different sectors that make up Nyamata district . They all gathered up in Ntarama . Therefore in order to attack them , we had to first make a sufficient team . And verify if we were strong enough to attack . As a result , there were few attacks in my area . However , there was another attack that I followed it 's stories and I know how it started although I never joined it . That was in a place called Bironda in Rusekera cell . That is the only other attack that took place in this sector . The rest of the attackers would gather from Ntarama with an aim of killing people in Ntarama .

Finally , he got out and when he reached out there , he told them that he was sick ; truly he was sick . Therefore , they told him that , "@ let us go . @" As they had reached in front , they said , "@ in this home there are traitors ! @" but one of them said , "@ do n't search them now . Let 's first go up to the end . @" He said so because the Inkotanyi had already captured that area of Remera at the Stedium . And fortunately they did n't come home . They looked scared and when they reached in front at the juction of the roads , they started saying , "@ among us they are traitors and suddenely the shootings from the Inkotanyi increased . Therefore , they went back and said that they should ensure security right from their homes . "@ About that home , we shall see it later . @" They said . That is how they left without searching our home . And , as he had just entered in the house , they throw a grenade to our house ; it landed on the roof , however no body was hurt ; it affected the roof only ; the roof split into pieces .

I am married and I have one child , and I am 31 years old . I witnessed every thing that took place in Kibungo . I followed up whatever happened during the day and in the night in that area in 1994 . It is true that there was a war in 1994 and I must admit that I participated in this war with other different people with the object of killing Tutsis and finishing them completely . But before that , the local leaders had sensitized the locals to participate in the killing together with the help of the soldiers , who were later joined by the policemen in the sensitisaton . All those leaders tried to persuade citizens to kill Tutsis . And if anything , to destruct all their properties and they assured us that no one would accuse us or follow up their cases . I will start by telling you what happened in that area . Generally the massacre started on the 9th . If I remember well it is when Ndengeyeinka 's house was destroyed . They even tortured him . On the 10th the massacre continued . Some villagers from this area , together with the help of soldiers , attacked a certain centre called Nyarunazi . So many people lost their lives in that attack . I can remember some of their names . There was Ndekezi , Bikino , Sango and Rubangiza . In that time you could see that people knew what they were doing and they did it with all their efforts . It did not stop there , on the14th April in 1994 . That was when we attacked Ntarama at the church . But before we went there , we held a meeting with people who lived in the sectors that surrounded Ntarama that is ; Kibungo , Kanzenze , Rurindo , Musenyi , people from other neighbouring districts like ; Gitarama district , Kanombe and Butamwa commune plus so many other people from here and there . We had to meet in one place near Ntarama , led by a policeman called Subuhindo who used to live in KANZENZE . I remember very well that we arrived there on the14th . Most of the TUTSI who were being hunted had fled to that church . Most of the soldiers and policemen we were with started planting bombs around the church and throwing grenades in the church . We did not stop there , but we also went and entered the church . We found that some had already died because of the bombs . So we started killing others using machetes , clubs . Honestly one has to say that . That time the TUTSIS were killed very harshly and the truth must be said . I was also there with the intension of killing and I should say that I also participated and I killed an old man using a club . For that reason I was imprisoned for six years . After all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile . When we returned the country I was imprisoned by the current government because I had participated in the massacre that took place in MURAMBI . Later , I admitted and I said the truth on what I did in MURAMBI and the people I was with . I had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow RWANDANS , so I felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it . I was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but I had already admitted and I had said the truth on what happened and the people I was with and I was released after that rule that was given by the president . But it does not mean that I have forgotten what I did . I remember very well that I killed that old man on that morning when I was in NTARAMA and I am always ready to say the truth of what happened in NTARAMA .

So you can understand that it was as though they had already killed him . Later again , they slaughtered him , because when we exhumed them , there were traces of a machete on his head and here [ on the neck ] , revealing the bones .
Mu kwezi kwa cumi 1990 , colonel Serubuga wari menbre du commite centrale akaba na chef d' etat major aggee w' arme rwandaise yavuze ko abonye uburyo ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwezi kwa cumi bwo kwica abatutsi bose mu Rwanda ibyo yarabivugaga buri gihe ko abatutsi ari abanzi b' urwanda ayo magambo yayabwiraga n' abafaransa , ko abatutsi bazapfa bose . ||| In October 1990 , colonel Serubuga who was a member of the central committee and Rwandan army chief staff said that he had just found the alibi to kill all Tutsis on October 1st all over Rwanda . He always said that , confirming that Tutsis were the enemies of the country . He even said it to French in his own words that Tutsis would all die .

Let 's say for example rain , when the rain became too much , there was a path of Kivu , the path of Kivu was a way the king had to do rituals so as stop the rain , there was also the path of Rukungungu when there was death as a result of too much sun shine , they would find a way in which the king would have a ritual to bring down rain , they had a way of praying to God and the rain would stop Every time there was a problem .

Ni ukuvuga ngo abanyarwanda turamutse tubaye abantu bakingutse , bakingukiranye nikonavuga ; bashobora kubwizanya ukuri . U Rwanda ubona rwajya ahantu heza . Ni ukuvuga ngo mu Rwanda rwacu hari abantu b' Inyangamugayo ariko harimo n' abandi ba ruryi bakimeze ... bagifite inda zi .. , zijya imbere , bashyize inda imbere . Rero u Rwanda rwacu ururebye , ururebye imbere gutya ubona ari u Rwanda rujya ahantu heza . Rufite vision nziza . Ariko mu gihe hataje za kirobya nk' ibyakera , ngo abantu bashyire inda imbere . Kandi bigenda bigaragara , ugenda ubibona ko hari abantu bafite inyungu zabo . Bashyize inda imbere . Jye niko mbibona . ||| Generally , I have come to realize that Rwandans are wise people . We are wise but hypocrites . If Rwandans were open to one another , I mean they can be honest towards each other ; the future of Rwanda would be good . In my country Rwanda there are honest people , however there are also others who are still greedy . If you critically observe Rwanda , you will find that Rwanda has a good vision . The only condition is that some of its people do not become selfish . It has been happening , people who put their personal interests forward . Sometimes I say they are selfish .

The first thing id to love . Sencondly they should put much effort in education because there will be no bright future for them if they do n't go to school . They should study and love each other . They should avoid hatred among them in all their lifetime on earth . Because where there is love , nothing misses . Therefore , the youngones should love each other . I guess even those kids who became Interahamwe ; it was due to their elders . But if the children experiences love , and be taught about love rather than hate . And avoid seeing their fellows and say , "@ look at that tutsi . @" Like they used to learn in the past . In the past . Tutsi children used to believe that they were ment to be menaced . Like during the genocide , some children would tell the killers that , "@ please forgive me , I will never be a Tutsi again . @" Just imagine , those were very young children but they already knew that they were menaced because they were Tutsis . Therefore , hatred should be up rooted and they should only keep in mind that there are only rwandans . And , every human being has a right to live . No one should be killed . That is the most important thing for the young ones . If they love each other , one would be knowing that , "@ I have to study for my own life . @" And the other one would say , "@ I want to do this and that . @" if he or she is good at business , then he or she should run business . If one is good at cultivatng , then she or he should mean business and cultivate . But forgeting that habit of having second thoughts about his or her fellows . That is my advice for children .

We were at home on the 7th of April 1994 . At night we heard that the President 's helicopter had crashed . My brother came in screaming , "@ We are all dead . I heard that Habyarimana is dead . @" I was still very young ; I was n't mature enough to understand issues concerning the war . I carelessly said , " Oh , if he is dead then we are finally going to get some peace . @" He replied to me , "@ Those are your wishes . All I can assure you is we are going to die . @" We kind of joked about it . The following day came but we did n't have any problems until the night fell . The next day we started hearing terrible rumours of houses being burnt here and there . I think it was four days after the death of Habyarimana that the Tutsis living in Nyamata started fleeing ; you would hear people saying , "@ Listen ! Things are getting worse here ! We have met people fleeing their homes . @" I wondered why but I heard some people saying that because of the plane crash and Habyarimana 's death , there is no way there could be peace in the country .

Only one aunt survived and very few cousins who are very young , our uncles also died . Most of them were exhumed and reburied at Gisozi . Others ... almost the whole family was decimated . The way we used to live with other people ... how our parents behaved around others is what helped us to live in their absence .

I would like to give a message to especially Rwandans who do n't know Rwanda . Because telling a Rwandan about genocide is not very difficult . Although they ignore it [ genocide ] , they know about it . But foreigners especially white people take things lightly . They do n't consider this the way they are . But in actual sense , they shy away from the truth . Because they had cameras and some of them participated in the genocide . For example the Belgians and those UN soldiers of UNAMIR together with others , they had all the information . All I can tell them is ; when we say this , it is not a form of enjoying life . When we say this ... consider the time I have spent here ! I am a student , I am surposed to be in class now with other students . I had to spend my time here instead of learning extra chapters in class ! I know it is very important to give out my testimony so that the whole world especially the foreigners would see it . I think the genocide that took place in Rwanda should be given its value . Although there is nothing they can do to help us as Rwandans , they should just believe that there was genocide in Rwanda and give it its value . When we spend days talking about the genocide , we do n't say it for sale . President Paul Kagame once talked about it . He said ; " Those who say that we sell genocide , I wish they tell me how much is a kilogram or a litter of blood . @"

I began with the information concerning Kayumba sector or Bugesera . I mean I am starting from what took place in Nyamata , Kanzeze because in those areas there were so many Tutsi . Whenever there could be any conflicts in the country , people in those areas could be in for it ; houses were burnt , blood was shed , in brief those were the target areas for genocidal acts . So , what happened , first there was what one could call ‘ hunting ’ , the following day , one could see at the hill ... [ I have failed to get a better way of giving you examples ] normally there was a hill where we lived , that hill was called Kayumba . Then there were other hills called Murama sector , Mwogo sector and Muyenzi sector , which sectors surrounded Kayumba . And Tutsis resided in Kayumba more than in other sectors . Then in the morning , one could see houses in flames and one would wonder . But the grown ups would vulnerably nod and say that there was no alternative , that we were going to be exterminated since they [ Hutu ] had started with their habit of burning houses .

When we met he said @: ‘ thank God I found back my sister and I would like to have her back with me . @" He took me again on his back and nothing happened to him , he had no wound . We continued to flee , whenever the Interahamwe would attack , we would flee to Gafunzo , nor go to Gasozi . Once the Interahamwe attacked and caught us surprising , normally they used to attack around 8 am But this time they came 6 am . We were used that whenever they came , they came shooting but this time they came without shooting so we could not hear them and we were even at the edge of the swamp , it was not easy to run into it . My brother managed to escape but it was difficult for him to flee me because I was terribly wounded the whole body so they caught me and others . They killed some of the people and made me sit down , they were watching me . When they finished to kill the ones inside the swamp and they took me with them , on our way going they saw a pot and told me to carry it , I asked them to let me search for some banana leaves so that I use them to carry but they forced me and put the pot on my head with all the wounds on it , they said @: ‘ carry this it is going to hurt you and kill you faster @"@ . I carried it and we continued till we reached the other church , they heard other people who were coming even shooting so one man among the Interahamwe who were with me started to shoot , and then they ran . They left me there and I hid myself in the bush till morning . In the morning around 4 00 am I went back to the other swamp and I could not find my brother . I spent three days without finding him , I found him on the third day .

Eh ||| What I know is that in school , the priest , the bishops , I am a priest so I know Peraudin it 's like I was his boss some time back . He really did n't like being disrespected . So to say that the Tutsi used to be disrespectful is something that was common in the time of colonialism , they spread it all over that the Tutsi were disrespectful , so he did n't like it . That 's why he created conflicts among them , saying he is not part of them and they are actually not even his brothers , so let them all die . Any way , if you want you can even say that with Habyarimana , those issues are mentioned . He is also a foreigner if you do n't know , he is a mufumbira . Did you know the meaning of the word mufumbira , do you know that the kitchen helpers who are cooks are called the bafumbira . It started with his father , he came from the Bufumbira land and came as a cook of the priests , it went on and that 's how they called them Bafumbira . They are helpers called Bafumbiras from Bufumbira . If you want you can also say that brought conflicts among Rwandans because he 's not Rwandan but that would be exaggerating . He actually brought conflicts so he can have the power , no one can say that he did because he did n't go against the killings among Rwandans . I too can n't tell if that 's the true reason . I can n't confirm that .

In all the testimonies that I gave out , I never talked about her because I always get shocked when I remember her . I always believe that I could have done something for her but I failed to it . The way I left the pit is the way I would have got her out . Then maybe she would have been treated or something else would have been done ... but that is not what I did . There was n't anybody to help me ; maybe if I had got someone , I would have asked him to help me save the lady . Most of the time , I dream about her and my young sister ; I always see their images . Even my two young sisters whom we do n't know how they were killed . I always remember them . Last time when we were exhuming my brother 's remaining , we almost lost his bones among other bones [ mixed with my sister in law 's bones ] but I separated them immediately . Now we reburied them separately but next to one another . At least now when I plant flowers on their graves , I feel better .

And the Interahamwe attacked Pascal Kamonyo who had stayed with our young sister . They beat Pascal very badly . And when my sister realized the way they were beating the man , she ran away . She went to hide in the home where my elder sister was also hiding . It became very easy for the killers ; they found them and killed both of them at the same time . My mother continued to ask the killers for her children but all they did was laugh at her . None of us know how they died but what we learnt later is that they took them to Karambo towards Mutara and this is where all the children were killed , after killing them , they threw them in river Kiryango . The same river where my father was drowned . That is how they died . Now my other young brother is still alive and he is a student in the 5th year of secondary school . He is called Serubibi Guido .

Eh siho mvuga . Ndavuga ko we yumvaga ko icya mbere ntiyari Umuhutu ntiyari n' Umututsi . Guteranya abanyarwanda afatanyije n' abazungu , kuri we yumvaga abanyarwanda bamaranye ntacyo bimutwaye . Byaba ... ||| that 's what I 'm saying . I am saying that he felt like first of all he was not Hutu neither was he Tutsi . To create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all Rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him .
Ibyo nibyo baje kumbwira baje kumbwirako yaje kuhicirwa . ||| That what they told me , they told that he was killed there

Uh ngira ngo ibintu birumvikanaho gatoya n' ubwo icya mbere ngira ngo k' ingenzi n' uko eh Musinga yari yaramenyereye kuba Umwami kuvuga rero ngo kuva uyu munsi nturi Umwami , kuvuga ngo uri umucakara s'ibintu byoroshye icyo nicyo cya mbere ntabwo rero yabyitwayemo neza kuko ntiyabyemeye . ntiyabyemeye birumvikana ntiwaba uri nyiri Igihugu ngo bakubwire ngo ntabwo uriwe ntaho ushingiye ngo wemere , ibyo byaramuvunye cyane ntiyabyumva . Ikindi cya kabiri rero Musinga bagirango anabatizwe yari umuntu wamenyereye idini yacu y' Imana bakavuga ngo n' Ibishenzi ngo ngw'arabandwa agira ate . ||| I think it 's a bit clear although I think the first and most important thing is that Musinga was accustomed to being king , so to say that from today on wards you are not a king , you are a slave is not an easy thing . He did not therefore take it very well because he did not agree to it to . It 's understandable because you can not have been a leader of a country and then be told that you are not , there is no way you can agree . That distressed him and he did not agree , secondly they wanted Musinga to be Baptised and yet he was accustomed to our beliefs in God and they said that it 's nonsense .

Of course you were admitted in Bushenge Hospital but I do n't Avega knew you out of the blue ! It must have happened in a way .

Hanyuma ; ibyo aribyo byose ; hari igihe umuntu avuga ati "@ Ibi bintu ntabwo bigenda neza @" ariko nawe ukumva watanga ho umwanzuro ; wagiraho inama nka Leta ukavuga uti mbese ; nibyo koko mwashyizeho Gacaca ; ariko Gacaca ikwiriye kubahirizwa gutya ; nibyo koko muravuga ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ariko bukwiriye kuba nyuma y' iki cyangwa bukagenda gutya ; Kugirango use n' uwanzura muri ; muri icyo cyerekezo . Kuko impamvu mbikubaza ni uko nzi ko uri umuntu umwe mu bantu bitangira kugirango abacitse ku icumu basubizwe agaciro kabo ; ariko kandi nanone abakoze ibyaha bahanwe ; n' abarenganye babe barenganurwa . Nk' umuntu ucisha mu kuri ndumva wakwanzura ujyana muri urwo ruhande . ||| Sometimes a person would say "@ Things are not going well @"@ . You feel like commenting on it , a small advice to the government . Yes it is good you have started the Gacaca justice but it should be followed in a certain way . There is also unity and reconciliation but it should come after this or match in another way so that we can conclude within this direction . The raison I say this is because there are people who are willing to give genocide survivors their respect back , who want criminals to be judged and to send free innocent people . The kind of people who work truthfully , I think this is the way we should pass through .
Nk' umunyarwanda , muri ubu buhamya bwanjye nagirango mbabwire ||| As a Rwandan . In this testimony I would like to tell you
Watubwiye ko ubu ufite imyaka 31 bishaka kuvuga yuko mu gihe cya génocide wari ufite imyaka 21 kuko imyaka 10 irashize .

Iby' amashyaka wabyumvise gute nk' umuntu w' umusore wari ugifite imbaraga wumvaga ushobora kwitabira ibintu nk' ibyo byari bifite imbaraga mu gihugu ? ||| You have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . That means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed . Well before the Genocide there used to be several political parties . Can you tell us the one you belonged to ? How did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ?

Iyo ideologie yari isanzweho kuva mu 1963 , uretse ko etat major yayishyize mu nyandiko , amashyaka mrnd , cdr , mdr pawer pl pawer n' amalisti yabo bigishije abayoboke babo ko umututsi uri mu Rwanda no hanze yarwo ari umwanzi ugomba gupfa , gushyiraho system no gushakisha umwanzi ngo atabacika bashyiraho za bariyeri mu mayira yose ari mu macellule mu Rwanda no gusaka mungo , no mu bihuru bashakisha aho umututsi yishishe ngo bamwice . ||| This ideology had already existed since 1963 and had just been put into writing by the army staff . Political parties such as MRND , CDR , MDR Power , and PL Power with their lists had convinced their members that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed . In order to locate the enemy and prevent him from escaping , barriers were set in all paths in cells of Rwanda . Houses and bushes were also searched to se where a tutsi might be hiding and kill him .

I do n't have money , he replied . You will give it to us , they said . He told them that they had found him sleeping and asked them to look for it . They did n't just let him go , they beat him and he gave them all the money he had on him .
ngo n' ajye mu Misa n' agire ate , ibyo nabyo ntiyari kumenya iyo idini atari idini ya ya kandi koko idini y' Imana ntacyo yari ibaye ba ba bayihinyuragaho n' ubungubu n' ubuswa uhh nanjye nd'umu Padiri mbabwira nanjye nd'umwe mu bantu barwanyije bimwe .

Baraje bakuraho izina ry' Imana bavuga ngo ni MUNGU ibyo twara ntimwabirwanyije twaranabinesheje Mungu twaramuciye ntare dusubiza Imana tugaragaza y' uko abirabura twari dufite idini baravugaga ngo nta dini tugira no kugeza igihe twabyemeje no kwa Papa bemera n' uko abanyafurika bafite idini . ||| And go to church , he could not understand that because it was not his faith and indeed that religion of God had no fault and they removed it and up to now it makes no sense . Even I as a preist I 'm one of the people who fought this . They came and said that our faith was based on idolatry and wrote about this in a book called "@ God is our father @" fighting this . They came and changed the name of God and said that it was "@ mungu @"@ . We fought against this and won , "@ mungu @" was removed and reinstated "@ imana @" and showed that we black people had a religion ; they used to say that we did no religion until we affirmed this to the Pope and the acknowlged that Africanas had a religion .

From 1959 , there were preparations leading to that . One who discerns would sense that it was leading to nowhere else but to that . It was very clear that someone would tell where it was going to . It was all from his speech that he had just pronounced saying that the Tutsi are the enemy of the state . A priest says that Tutsis are bad in general yet he knows that man was created by God .

For example Butamwa where I come from , I returned there for the first time when I was looking for an identity card . I got there when there was a case in progress . I attended it even though I really did n't have it on my mind and I have little interest in court proceedings . I stood up and told them that I also wanted to accuse some people , they all laughed and asked me if I had come to look for compensation . I told them that it was n't what had taken me there . Then one of them asked me to introduce myself because I had forgotten to do it at first . I told them both my father 's and my mother 's names and after they knew them , they apologized and told me that by that time I was young and they did n't remember me .

I told her everything his husband did to me and she told @: ‘ I am sorry , but you should have reported him at the police . @" I said to her @: ‘ I reported and later on he escaped . @" I realized that the man did not go in the same country of his wife , but he went in different one . The wife was still in Belgium . Later his wife wrote to me and said that he was in Australia and he has contacted her . I stayed in that life , I stayed with that mother and she helped me as she could till I gave birth .

The victims of the genocide were innocent . My parents , my friends and relatives ... I really believe that justice needs to take action . It is hard to find the right words to say it ... Umh nothing can bring them back , that is impossible . Some people killed others ... let 's say there are several people who killed others in the History of the world , but they were killing people with whom they did n't have anything in common . But Rwandans killed each others while in reality , they were brothers and sisters ! Therefore , you can never find the appropriate punishment to exercise on them . Death is not a punishment . Neither is imprisonment . I guess people should be sensitized and there should be justice . And the law should determine the kind of punishments to be given so that people will learn that Human Rights should be respected . Be it a child or an old woman or an old man , be it a Hutu or a Tutsi , be it a foreigner or any other person , as long as blood is shed , nobody should be killed when they are innocent ! And justice needs to be there . Not only in Rwanda , I would request for justice in the whole world . Because justice is needed . People should n't die innocently .

Since I am currently the oldest son in the family , I took upon myself all the family responsibilities yet I can not even fulfill their needs . As a result , I ended up growing up prematurely . Now I am considered as an old man at home ; I am the one who makes the decisions in the family . At my early age , I feel denied my freedom . I do n't find time to enjoy life like I should have at my age ; things like playing around with fellow teenagers or do other fun things . Instead I spend my entire time worrying about things that actually seem impossible to me , problems of which solutions are not easy to find .

Our grandfather had shifted to Mwendo and we lived on his land . He had a very large land . The reason I am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone .

We walked down to the swamp to hide thinking that at least we could rest from running that day . We hid in groups of two to avoid being in a big group . Before we entered the swamp , we would cut banana leaves to spread them down where we would sit , but that did not stop us from getting wet . At around nine o'clock , we heard the attackers coming to the swamp . There were other Interahamwe who were up on the hill to watch people who were hiding in the swamp , then they would shout directing the others about which side we were hiding . Within a short time they were near us . They were six Interahamwe and we were two , the other boy and I , one attacker had a sharp metal , others had machetes and another one had a club .

The Genocide was conceived in 1994 , it actually started in 1959 and they went on practicing it to the end . In all those times they went on saying those things , they were people of the church who wronged it . Talking about the church in general while mentioning people we know such as the leaders , whoever is called a Christian , baptized and goes to church I can call him a member of the church . In the beginning let 's start with Kayibanda to make it easy .

There are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where I always say we failed including myself because I am a catholic and a bishop .

We live in peace with our neighbours . I did not have any hatred for TUTSIS because I had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years . But the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of HABYARIMANA . We sensed segregation among people that particular day . People started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at TUTSIS as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the TUTSIS . And so you should stand up and defend him .

No one could bother to carry me out of there . I tried both legs and found that I had some little strength left in them but they were injured . I knew when the wounds are still fresh ; it was possible to move around . The only risk was that I could suddenly fall due to over bleeding . So I tried walking and it worked . You can guess that by then , the pain had not started yet so I started running following them . I was avoiding to be left in the bush alone , so I took off . The people I was meeting were wondering how far I would be able to run .

Therefore I assured myself that if I report myself , my punishment would be reduced . So in my plans I knew I would report myself because I had noticed that things had become worse in my life .
