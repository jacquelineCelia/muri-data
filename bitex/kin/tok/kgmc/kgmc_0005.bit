Uyu munsi n' itariki ejanu z' ukwezi kwa gatatu ibihumbi bibiri na karindwi ndi hano ku kimironko kwa murebwayire Josephine . ||| Today is 5th of march 2007 I am here in Kimironko at Murebwayire Josephine 's home .
Aho tugiye kuganira amateka y' ibintu byabaye muri jenocide ..... Twagirango mutangire mutwibwira . ||| We would like you to introduce yourself to us as we are about to talk about what happened in the genocide .
Nitwa murebwayire Josephine ntuye mu kimironko mu kagali ka nyagatovu mu karere ka gasabo . ||| My names are Murebwayire Josephine I live in Kimironko in the sector of Nyagatovu in the district of Gasabo .
Ese twagirango noneho utubwire mbere ya jenocide itaraba umuryango wanyu mwari mubayeho gute ese wari ufite umuryango ungana iki ? ||| We would like you to tell us about your life with your family before the genocide , how big was your family ?
Udusobanurire umuryango uko wanganaga abana umugabo noneho nurangiza uze kutwereka ishusho cyangwa se isura yuko uwo muryango wanyu wari ubayeho mbere ya jenocide . ||| Explain to us and tell us how big your family was ; your children , your husband and then after try and give us an idea or paint an image for us on how your life was before the genocide .
Mbere ya jenocide twari dutuye ahantu bita imasoro icyo gihe bahitaga muri secteur ya ndera . ||| Before the genocide we lived in a place called Masoro at that time it was called Ndera sector .
Komine rubungo niho twari dutuye ubu ni akarere ka gasabo nari mfite umugabo n' abana batandatu . ||| Commune Rubungo is where we lived , nowadays it 's called Gasabo district , I had a husband with six children .
Abahungu batatu n' abakobwa batatu twari dufite nundi mwana twareraga mwishywa w' umugabo wanjye . ||| Three boys and three girls , we also had a child that we had adopted , my husband 's niece .
Twari tubanye neza twari dufite urugo rwiza twari dufite imibereho ishimishije umugabo wanjye yarakora . ||| We were living in harmony , we had a nice house , our standard of life was good , and my husband was working .
Yarikoreraga yakoraga akazi kubukanishi ari umu tekinisiye nange ndi umu maman w' abana ndi murugo ariko mfite indi mirimo nkora kuko twari dufite na butike . ||| He was a self employed mechanic and I was a mother at home with the children even though I had other things to do because we had a small shop .
Ncuruza dufite n' isambu nziza dufite inka ndeberera imirimo yose yo murugo twari twifashije . ||| So I was in a business and we also had a nice piece of land and cows , I was supervising all the activities at home , we were doing great .
Yeee hanyuma abana bange bari bakuru bari bamaze gukura bari muri sogonderi umukuru yari ari mu wa kane sogonderi umuto yari mu wa kane primaire . ||| My children were growing up and were in secondary school , the oldest was in senior four and the youngest was in primary four .
Hanyuma nari mfite n' abandi bavandimwe twabanaga basaza banjye babiri . ||| We also lived with my two brothers .
Umwe twari tumaze kumushyingira atuye hafi yacu mbese twari umuryango munini ushimishije hanyuma jenocide yatangiye mubyukuri muri mirongo icyenda nibwo twumvise ko inkotanyi zateye . ||| One had just gotten married and he lived near us , we were a big nice family , the genocide rally started in 1990 , that 's when we heard that the Inkotanyi [ RPF ] had attacked .
Bavuga ko zaturutse ibyumba ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwacumi mirongo cyenda twese twabyumvise kimwe n' abaturanyi bacu ntabwo twari tuzi ibyo aribyo . ||| They said they came from Byumba on the 1st of October 1990 , we all did n't know what it was when we heard about it with our neighbours .
Ariko itariki ya karindwi z' ukwacumi mirongo icyenda niho umugabo wanjye baje kumufatako ari ikitso k' inkotanyi . ||| On the 7th of October 1990 that 's when they came to arrest my husband saying he was a spy for the Inkotanyi .
Basanze Atari no murugo kuko babanje kuvuga ko nta Bantu bagomba kuva murugo ariko twebwe kuberako twari dufite iyo butike yari iriho musaza wanjye . ||| They did n't find him at home , because even though they had said that nobody should leave their homes , my brother went to the shop to work because it was near the house .
Azamuka agiye kureba uko bimeze kuri iyo butike abaje kumufata basanze arijyewe uri murugo n' abana . ||| So my husband also went to see how things were at the shop , the people who were coming to arrest him only found me and the children at home .
Ni njyewe babanje gutwara ariko babanje gukora ibindi bitari byiza gusaka gukubita , bakajya bankubita ibibuno by' imbunda bambaza ngo imbunda twari dufite irihe ? ||| So they took me first but before that they were doing bad things ; searching the house and throwing things around , hitting me with their gun @-@ butt asking me where I had hidden the gun that we had .
Ubwo ku itariki enye bari baraye barasa baravuga ngo nitwebwe twaraye turasa mu mugi wa Kigali . ||| On the 4th of October 1990 they had spent the night shooting in the air and they said that we were the ones that were shooting Kigali .
Bambaza imbunda barayibura ari basanga twari dufite jumeri umugabo wanjye yajyana guhiga yajyaga ajyana n' abapadiri baba seriziyani . ||| They kept asking me about the gun but they could n't find it but they found binoculars that my husband used when hunting , he did it with priests .
Bayibonye bavuga yuko ariyo tureberamo inkotanyi baba babonye urwitwazo hari gurude za mazi abana bajyanagamo amazi nubwo hari hafi ariko hari ubwo batwaragamo amazi . ||| When they saw it they said that we use it to look at the Inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . There were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them .
Bavugako ari izabasirikari barankubita ariko bita babaje cyane bambaza ngo ninerekane ibyo nahishe ngo ninerekane izo nkotanyi . ||| They said it belonged to soldiers and they started beating me but not too much , telling me to show them everything else I had hidden and show them the Inkotanyi .
Imbunda zabo hanyuma babibuze barantwara mu modoka bambwira ngo nibamubona barandekura turazamuka tugeze hafi yiyo butike turamubona . ||| When they did n't get the guns they took me in the car and said that if they get my husband they will release me and let me go , when we reached near the shop we saw him .
Ndababwira nti dore umugabo wange nguriya araje ||| So I said to them , there is my husband , he is coming .
barahagarara baramubwira ngo niyinjiremo ajye kubaha imbunda nabemereye ngo ariko njyewe nanze kuzibaha atampaye uruhushya . ||| They stopped and told him to enter the car and go give them the gun I had promised them but could n't give it away without his permission .
Ndavuga nti murambeshyeye barambwira ngo ninsohoke nsange abana ngo we baraza kumugarura . ||| So I protested that they had just lied and they told me to get out of the car and watch over the kids saying that they will bring him back later .
Umugabo baramujyana nange ndamanuka nsanga abana ariko ubona ko abaturanyi bacu babonyeko koko turi inyenzi ako kanya batangira kuduha akato . ||| They took my husband and I went back home to watch over the kids but at that moment you could see that our neighbours started looking at us like we were cockroaches and stigmatizing us .
Ndagenda njya murugo negeranya ibintu byose bari bavangavanze negeranya amasaka negeranya n' amasukari ntabwo bagira gahunda . ||| I went home and rearranged everything they had disorganized and thrown around , wheat and sugar . They were very confused .
Nuko birangije abana ndabegeranya ndabahumuriza ndababwira naringiye nange na papa yagiye nubu bagaruka bakantwara ariko muhure . ||| I called all my children and started comforting them telling them that they almost took me , dad was taken , they might come back and take me too but do not be afraid .
Twari abantu basenga njyewe nari umuntu wemera nkumvako nibibaye byose Imana iba ibizi ndabahumuriza ndababwira nti muhumure natanagaruka muzabaho nzajya mbakorera icyo ngomba kubakorera . ||| We were a praying family , so I was a firm believer that no matter what happens God knows and is in control , so I comforted them and told them that even if their father does not return they will live , telling them that I will do all my best and work hard and provide for all their needs .
Nka maman wanyu ariko ubwo sigeze nemerako yagiye Atari bugaruke namaze iminsi ibiri yose nteka nkashyira ibiryo mu kabati mvuga ngo araje araje . ||| As a mother I did n't believe that he was n't going to return , for two days I would prepare food and keep it in the cupboard for him .
Nta muntu wari ukigera murugo yewe nuwo negeraga wabonaga afite ubwoba yuko ndibumukoreho . ||| Nobody was even reaching our home anymore ; if I came close to someone they would seem afraid that I was going to cause them trouble .
Nuko nkajya mbyuka ngenda murugo hariya irubungo ni kure ya Kigali nkabura umbwira ati araha naha . ||| So I would wake up and go home , Rubungo is far from Kigali and nobody would direct me where he might be .
Bigeze mu kwezi kwa cumi na biri baza kutubwirako twazajya kubaza kuri seyiseyeri bakatubwira amakuru y' abantu bacu bafunz . ||| In December we were told that we can go ask at CICR about our people who were put in jail .
Sinari nahazi nzakujyayo umuntu aranyobora icyo gihe narayobye ntungukira kwa perezida habyarimana hariya mu kiyovu . ||| I did n't know the place so someone directed me but I got lost and went to president Habyarimana 's house in Kiyovu .
Abasirikare banyicaza hasi bambaza ibyangombwa bambaza indangamuntu nuko barambwira ngo ndi inyenzi ndabahakanira ko ntariyo . ||| Soldiers made me sit down and asked for my identity card and then they said that I was a cockroach but I denied it telling them I was n't a cockroach .
Barambwira bati ugiye he nti ngiye kuri seyiseyeri bati ubwo ufite inyenzi ubwo ufite ibyitso nti n' umuntu wampamagaye ushaka kumpa akazi . ||| They asked me where I was going and I told them CICR so they said I was going to see spies , no someone called me to offer me a job , I said .
Nuko ndagenda bambwira ngo ningende nikoreye amaboko ngende ndirimba ko nta nzira iri aho . ||| So they told me raise my hands and walk away singing there is no way here .
Ngenda mbivuga ariko uwo musirikari arahanyereka arahangeza mpageze rero ndabaza barambwira bari reka turebe niba ari muri computer sinarinzi na computer icyo aricyo . ||| One of the soldiers showed me the place and I walked away saying what they had asked me to say , when I reached there I asked and they told me they were going to check in the computer , I did n't even know what a computer was .
Barareba barambwira bati ntawe twabonye kuri liste y' abandi bati ubanza yarapfuye . ||| So when they checked they said that he was n't on the list with everyone else may be he died , they said .
Nararize cyane haza umuzungukazi arambwira ati ko urira niki ndamubwira nti ngewe bari bambwiye ngo iyo umuntu aje hano bamubwira amakuru y' umuntu we iyo afunze . ||| I started crying hysterically , a white lady saw me and she came and asked me what was wrong ? I replied to her that I had been told that if I come at their office they would tell me about my loved one who is in jail .
Nti umugabo wanjye baramutwaye none barambwiye ngo ntawe arambwira ati noneho genda nyuma y' iminsi itatu uzagaruke kureba ndagenda . ||| My husband was taken , now I am being told that he is not on the lists . So she told me to go home and come back in three days .
Nyuma y' iminsi itatu naragarutse arambwira ngo nimusigire amazina ngo azambariza naragarutse nsanga umugabo yanyandikiye nyine ambwira amakuru ye nyine ko ari muri gereza . ||| After three days I came back , she had asked me to give her the names of my husband . She told me that my husband was in prison .
Hariya 1930 natangiye kujya njyayo ngirango ndamusura ariko yarinze afungurwa nyuma ya mezi atandatu ntaramubona kimwe n' abandi . ||| So I started going to visit him at the 1930 prison but did n't see him until he was released six months after just like everyone else .
Ntabwo abantu bacu twababonaga baravugaga ngo nituzane ibintu babashyire tukajyayo kuwa kane wa nyuma w' ukwezi . ||| We were not allowed to see our loved ones ; they told us to just bring whatever we were bringing for them on the last Thursday of the month , telling us that it would be delivered to them .
Icyo tujyanye tukagihereza aba suruveya ariko baducunaguza ariko badukubita ntiwamenyaga niba byamugezeho cyangwa bitamugezeho . ||| So whatever we would take we would give it to the guards as they were threatening and beating us , there was no certainty that our loved ones would get it .
Yafunguwe yari amazemo amezi atandatu araza tuba murugo umuntu akibaza ese bizagenda bite ariko tubona habaye agahenge umuntu asubira mubuzima busanzwe . ||| He was released after six months and came back home , but from that point we were not sure what was going to happen next , but after a while it was peaceful and life seemed to return to normal .
Bigeze muri mirongo icyenda na kabiri nibwo twatangiye kumva bishe za bugesera bigogwe akavuga ati ubanza bitazagera hano mbese tukumva ninko gutoranya nk' abagabo . ||| In 1992 that 's when we started hearing about the killings in Bugesera , Bigogwe and he would say that may be it will n't reach our region , we thought they were just selecting and killing men .
Ukavuga uti noneho nagenda ntagaruka ariko tukumva bitazafata intera ndende nkiyo byafashe muri mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| When he would walk out I would keep thinking that he will n't return but we never thought that it would be as bad as it was in 1994 .
Yarongeye asubira ku kazi arakora nkuko bisanzwe hanyuma rero bihita bigera muri mirongo icyenda na kane biba uko byagenze . ||| He went back to work and went on with life as usual and then everything else happened as you know in 1994 .
Hanyuma mirongo icyenda na kane abantu bavuga ko iriya ndege ya habyarimana ikimara kumanuka aribwo jenocide yatangiye yo gutsemba uabantu no kumaraho . ||| In 1994 they say that the genocide and killings started after Habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
Ariko uko yagiye itangira byaterwaga na karere ese wowe iwanyu ahantu mwari mutuye ese mwabwiwe niki ko jenocide yatangiye ese mwaba mwaramenyeko iyo ndege ya habyarimana yaguye . ||| But I think the way it started depended on the region and the place where one stayed . How did you know that the genocide had started in the place where you stayed ? Did you know that Habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
Ese byabagezeho bite twagirango udusobanurire ? ||| How did all the events unfold in your lives , I would like you to explain and tell us ?
Twebwe aho twari dutuye hari hateganye na kanombe mubyukuri ari mu kabande ariko ibyaberga ikanombe washoboraga kubibona . ||| The place where we stayed was just opposite Kanombe , it was in the valley but you could see everything that happens in Kanombe .
Indege yarahanutse ntitwamenya ibyo aribyo ariko twumva ikintu kiraturitse hari ni joro twiryamiye nta mashanyarazi twari dufite ngo turatarama cyane . ||| When the plane was shot down we did n't know what it was but heard a loud explosion , it was at night and we were sleeping , we did n't have electricity so that we can stay up late .
Twari turyamye ariko kwa kundi abantu baba bakiri maso abantu baganira ntitwabyitaho turakomeza turiryamira . ||| We were in bed but not really asleep , in fact we were still talking but when heard the explosion we did n't give it much thought and we went on sleeping .
Saa kumi nimwe umugabo yafunguye radio twumva harimo musique classique aravuga ati habaye cout d' etat igihe tugishaka kubiganiraho ngo tubijyeho impaka . ||| At 5 am my husband turned on the radio and it was playing classical music so he said there was a coup @-@ d' état , when we were starting to argue about it .
Baba bacishijeho itangazo niba ar'ingabo niba ari irya perezidanse ivugango indege yari itwaye umukuru w' igihugu yahanutse . ||| There was an announcement on the radio am not sure if it was from the president 's office or the military command but it said that the plane carrying the president had crashed .
Ubwoba buratwica turabyuka ndamubwira nti turashize arambwira ati reka reka ati uwaduhigaga arapfuye none ngo turashize ndamubwira nti oya nti ntabwo dukize ahubwo turashize . ||| We were terrified and woke up , I said to him that its over for us but instead he said no the one who wanted us dead is gone and you are saying its over for us , I replied and said that we were not going to live instead it was over .
Igihe tukibijya impaka tumva abantu barakomanze kurugi rwo mugikari ndabyuka ndagenda nkinguye nkubitana n' abasirikari baje iwacu ||| As we were still arguing we heard a knock at the back door , so I woke up and went to open the door where I met with soldiers .
Mu byukuri barabeshya ntabwo jenocide yatangiye muri mirongo icyenda na kane kuko iyo itangira muri mirongo icyenda na kane ntabwo baba bamenye ako kanya . ||| They lie but the genocide did n't start in 1994 , if it had then they would n't have found me straight away .
Ngo barajya kwa nde barica kwande ahubwo babiteguye kera indege iba imbarutso . ||| They knew where to find everybody and who to kill , it was planned long ago , the plain just marked the beginning .
Gusa wo kugirango barangize umurimo wabo ariko ntabwo aribwo jenocide yatangiye baritoje bakora gahunda neza ahubwo mvuga ko uwo munsi aribwo bayinonosoye . ||| That 's when they started working but that 's not when the genocide started , because they were already well trained and had planned , so I say that 's the day when it was implemented and perfected .
Ni nabwo jenocide yarangiye nubwo aribwo yatangiye ubwo abasirikari baraje bazana n' umwana w' iwacu aje kubayobora . ||| That 's when the genocide was over even though that 's when it started , so the soldiers came with one of our children showing them the way .
Bamufashe munzira yari umwana w' abatutsi kuko hahigwaga abatutsi ariko niwe wabazanye bari bafite liste y' abantu benshi ariko ari twebwe turi ku isonga . ||| They found him on the way , Tutsi 's were being hunted and him being one they got him and he brought them . They had list with many names and ours were at the top of the list .
Baraza nkinguye nyine turakubitana barambwirango mwishimye se ngo abantu bahanuye indege y' umukuru w' igihugu barihe hehe ? ||| When I opened I saw them and they said that I must be happy and they asked for the people who shot down the president 's plane .
Ndavuga nti se bari hano ngo ariko mwishimye nti se twishimye umuntu yishimira ko undi yapfuye . ||| I said there was nobody here and told them that we can not be happy because someone else died .
Ngo nti mwamwangaga se nti se tumwanga turamuzi cyangwa we aratuzi nti ntabwo twishimye nti twabimenye nkuko abandi bose babimenye . ||| Did n't you hate him , they said ? Can we hate someone we do n't even know or does he know us ? We heard it like everyone else .
Ntabwo byadushimishije ntawishimirako undi yapfuye ngo kandi arimwe mwamuhanuye ngo kandi inyenzi zamuhanuye ari zenewanyu . ||| Nobody is happy that he died especially when you are the ones that shot down his plane and the cockroaches who did it are your relatives
Ngo ubu se inyenzi zamuhanuye si zenewanyu ntiziri ahangaha ngo umugabo wawe ari heahe ngo mutwereke aho aryamye turajyana mucyumba ndamubereka . ||| Are n't the cockroaches that shot it down your relatives ? Are n't they here ? Show us where your husband is ? I took them to the room where he was sleeping .
Bahita bamfata bafata n' abana bose baragenda badukingirana mugikoni hanze n' abakozi bamaze kudukingiranamo bagaruka munzu bamusangamo baramubwira bati . ||| They took me and the children and locked us in the kitchen with the workers and then they came back in the house and said to him
Duhe amafaranga ati nta mafaranga mfite bati urayaduha ati ubu se ko musanze ndyamye ngaho nimuyashake ubwo cyakora urabyumva ntibari kumureka baramukubise amafaranga yari afite arayabaha . ||| Give us money . I do n't have money , he replied . You will give it to us , they said . He told them that they had found him sleeping and asked them to look for it . They did n't just let him go , they beat him and he gave them all the money he had on him .
Baramubwira bati umugore wawe ashobora kuba abitse amafaranga menshi abagore nibo babika amafaranga . ||| They said to him , your wife must be keeping a lot of money ; women are the ones that keep money .
Baraza barankingurira abana barongera barabakingirana ndagenda bati duhe amafranga umugabo wawe avuzeko ari wowe uyabitse . ||| They opened the door for me and kept the children locked up , and then they told me to give them the money that my husband had told them that I was the one keeping it .
Nti nta mafaranga mfite rwose bati duhe ndababwira nti se ubundiko mwaje mufite ibyo mushaka mwakwihaye ibyo mushaka ariko mukatubisa . ||| I told them that I did n't have any money as they kept asking for it . So I said to them , why do n't you take whatever you want and leave us in peace , it is clear that you came for a purpose .
Nuko bafata ibibabangukiye baragenda barangije baravuga ngo yemwe twari tuje kwishakira ibintu ngo ababica bari inyuma.a ||| So they took whatever they could manage as they were going away and said that they were only there looking for what to take but those who were going to kill us where on their way .
Bahita bagenda bamaze kugenda bimaze kuba hafi saa tatu abantu bo kugasozi ka batutsi abagore babo bose tubona baramanutse baje iwacu . ||| They went away and then around 9h we saw the wives of all the Tutsis on one of the hills coming towards our house .
Twari dufite urugo runini cyane ndababwira nti se ko muje hano muziko hano ariho ibintu bicikira bwa mbere nitwe batwaye mu byitso murajya he . ||| We had a big compound , so I asked them why they were coming at our home when it was the first place where they look , we are the ones they arrested first as spies , why did you come here ?
Nitwe babanje bwa mbere bati oya wenda dupfane cyangwa bigenda ukundi ariko turaguma hano . ||| We were the first ones to be arrested . No , may be we 'll die together or something like that but we are not living this place .
Ubwo abagabo bo bari bataratekereza ibintu byo guhunga tubaye aho ngaho bigeze nko mu ma saa sita saa saba gutyo tubona abantu benshi . ||| The men had not yet thought about fleeing , so we stayed there and at around one in the afternoon we saw a lot of people .
Baragenda kugasozi ko hakurya yacu baturutse za remera bafite ibikapu ari benshi turavuga tuti natwe duhunge ariko abagabo barasigara . ||| Walking on the opposite hill , they were many and coming from Remera with bags , so we said to ourselves that we should also flee , but the men stayed there .
Nabasaza banjye babiri n' abahungu bange babiri bakuru basigara murugo ndagenda n' abana batoya abana banjye bane nako gakobwa twareraga nabo badamu twari kumwe . ||| My two brothers and my two older sons also stayed home and I went with the four remaining children with the girl that we had adopted and the other women that we were together .
Tugeze hakurya abantu batangira kudukumira batubuza kugenda naho zari interahamwe zihunze inkotanyi i remera . ||| When we reached a bit farther some people started blocking our way stopping us from moving forward but we did n't know that they were Interahamwe fleeing Inkotanyi from remera .
Kuko ntitwari tuzi ibyo aribyo dutangira gutatana bamwe bagaca murutoki abandi bakagenda urumva twavuye murugo ari ku manywa ariko twageze ahantu twashakaga kujya indera ariko biratunanira duhura n' umuntu aratubwira ati hariya hari bariyeri . ||| But we did n't know what was happening and started separating some going through the banana plantations , others going on along the way . We left home during the day but almost reaching our destination , a place called Ndera it was n't possible because we met someone who told us that there was a road block just ahead .
Abandi barakomeza bajya ahantu hitwa ijurwe ngewe n' abana tujya ahantu hari imyumbati twihishamo tubonye imodoka y' abapolisi tubamo tugeze k' umugoroba hatakibona . ||| The others continued to a place called Jurwe , me and my children we went and hid in a place where there was cassava when we saw a police car , we stayed there until it was dark in the evening .
Turagenda noneho yanzira y' indera turayireka dufata inzira y' ahantu hitwa i musave wari bwije hatabona dusanga abantu bose niho bahungiye hari hara mashuri . ||| We went on but decided not to go to Ndera but instead went to a place called Musave , it was dark and we could n't see but reaching there found that that 's where everyone took refuge , there was a school .
Mbwira abantu twari turi kumwe nti nanjye nimunyicire ririya shuri nange nigiremo n' abana ndabona hariya huzuye . ||| So I asked the people I was with to force the door open of one of the classrooms since all the other classrooms seemed full .
Naho ubwo ndabwira interahamwe nziko ari abantu b' iwacu duturanye ishuri bararyishe turaramo n' abakozi ||| I did n't know that I was telling Interahamwe , I thought I was telling my people . They forced the door open and we spent the night there with the workers .
N' abandi bana babaturanyi mu gitondo hafi saa mbiri mbona abandi baratetse nta kintu nari najyanye cyakora nari natwaye isukari yo nari nayibutse jya gutira isafuriya . ||| With other children that were our neighbours , in the morning around 8 am I saw that the others were cooking but I had n't taken anything except for sugar that I had remembered , I went to borrow a saucepan .
Kugirango ntekere abana icyayi mvuye gutira ya safuriya barambwira ngo haje imodoka yuzuye interahamwe ||| So that I can prepare tea for my children , after I had borrowed the saucepan I was told that a car full of Interahamwe was on its way .
Yasafuriya ndayita noneho nsa nugenda mpambiranya igitenge kuri buri mwana kugirango ntaza kubata munzira . ||| I threw away the saucepan and started tying a piece of the loincloth that I had on every child so that I will n't leave them on the way .
Kuberako narimfite souvenir mbi cyane ngewe natakaye mu ishyamba iwacu bahunga muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu . ||| I had very bad memories because I got lost in the forest when my family was fleeing in 1963 .
Ntoragurwa n' abantu noneho ngahora numva umwana wange murekuye nawe yatakara ubwo ndabakuruye tugeze imbere gato duhura n' imodoka y' umuhungu w' iwacu ariko nawe yari interahamwe . ||| I was found by some people , so I felt that if I let go of my child they would also get lost . So I pulled them and when we reached a little bit further we saw a car and inside was a guy form our region but he was an Interahamwe .
Yari umushoferi w' imodoka ya komini yari aje gutwara umuryango we wari uraho ngaho twari twahararanye . ||| He was a driver of the commune and was coming to take his family which had also spent the night in the same place with us .
Mbona ndamuzi noneho ndamubwira nti none se nange mwanshyizemo mukantwara n' abana arancira mu maso arambwira ngo urajya hehe se ko akanyu kashobotse ubwo arabapakiye baragiye . ||| I recognized him and I asked him if he could also take me with my children , he spit in my face and asked me where I was going since it was over for us . He packed his family in the car and left .
Nanjye ndakomeje nkururana n' abana tugenda n' amaguru tugana indera tugeze mu nzira ahantu bita imusave ugiye kugera indera . ||| So I kept pulling my children behind me as we walked towards Ndera , when we were almost there at a place called Musave .
Duhura n' imodoka irimo burugumesitiri wa rubungo ari kumwe nundi mugabo wiwacu nawe waruje kureba umuryango we wari uraho ngaho abana twari twararanye . ||| We saw a car with the head of region of Rubungo and another man that was also from our region who was also coming to see his family which had spent the night in the same place with us .
Nti abana bagiye nti bababwiye ko maman wabo ariho nti abana bagiye nuko adushyira mu modoka aratujyana atugeza indera kuri paruwasi . ||| I told him that his children had left ; they were told that their mother was alive . So , he put us in the car and took us to Ndera at the Catholic parish .
Aravuga ati umugabo wawe naba bahungu bawe bari indera kuri paruwasi ngwino mbagushyire turagenda tutaragera kuri paruwasi tugera ahantu hitwaga mugahoromani tuhasanga bariyeri . ||| He said , your husband and sons are at the Catholic parish let me take you there . We went but before reaching the parish we reached a place called mugahoromani and there was a roadblock .
Hari hariho abantu baba polisi n' abandi baturage umwe afata icumu agiye kurintera aramubwira ati nurimutera nange ndakurasa baratureka turagenda . ||| There were policemen and other peasants , one of them got a spear and was ready to throw it at me and the man told him that if he throws it at me he will shoot him , they let us go .
Tugera kuri paruwasi abandi bari ku iseminari hirya nuko noneho padiri mukuru waho ahita aza aratwakira uwo mupadiri mukuru ubu aba hariya inyamata . ||| We reached the parish , other people were in the seminary a little bit further , the head priest came and welcomed us , he lives in Nyamata now .
Yitwa rugengamanzi niwe wari padiri mukuru aratwakira azana yari yabahaye nibyo bateka batetse baratwakiriye baratugaburiye tubonako tubonye ubuhungiro . ||| He is called Rugengamanzi , he was the head priest . He welcomed us ; he had even given them food to cook . So they welcomed us and gave us food and we were comforted that we had got refuge .
Ariko ngewe kuri paruwasi nkumva simpashaka kubera hari umugabo twahoraga duhanganye kuva umugabo wanjye yafungwa mubyitso . ||| But personally I did n't want to stay at the parish because there was a man that we were not at good terms with since my husband was imprisoned among the spies .
Umupadiri witwa gakuba yahoraga ampiga ambwira abantu ko ndi ikitso ko turi inyenzi mbese agahora ashakisha ikintu cyatuma hari ncika no mu kiriziya ahari kigatuma n' abantu bangirira nabi . ||| A priest called Gakuba always looked for me telling people that I was a spy , that we were cockroaches , always looking for a reason that I would stop me from coming to church or cause other people to harm me .
Nuko noneho mbwira umugabo nti ariko aha hantu ntabwo bahakorotiriye nti kandi dore abantu barimo barahagendagenda nti kandi na gakuba natubona arahadutsinda ||| So I told my husband that the place had no fence and people were walking in and out at ease and also told him that if Gakuba sees us he will kill us .
Nti twigire mu iseminari ubwo hari ku itariki ya munani nuko ducunga abandi ku jisho twigira mu iseminari abandi t.basiga aho ngaho ariko byari byegeranye . ||| So I told him that instead we go to the seminary , it was the 8th . So we made sure nobody saw us and then went to the seminary which was not very far away .
N' abana banjye bose na basaza bange bose turagenda tujya mu iseminari turaharaye hari ahantu hari isale twicaye turaye dusenga mbega twabonaga ibintu bitameze neza . ||| With all my children and brothers we went to the seminary where we spent the night . There was a hall and we spent the night praying because things were not well .
Bashyiraho gouvernement ya batabazi nibwo twamenyeko tuvanze n' interahamwe baratangira barishima noneho tukumva ntabwo tukivuga ibintu bimwe . ||| The interim government was put in place , that 's when we found out that we were mixed with Interahamwe because they started celebrating , all of a sudden we did n't talk the same language .
Turara dufite ubwoba buracya mugitondo ku itariki ya cyenda niba guverinoma barayishyizeho ku yamunani niba ari kuya cyenda simbyibuka ariko ni muri iyo minsi ku itarik ya cyenda ku wagatandatu hari mugitondo ||| We spent the night in a lot of fear , in the morning of the 9th , I do n't remember well if the interim government was put in place on the 8th or 9th but it 's around that time . So on the morning of the 9th .
Interahamwe ziraza harabanza haza mbonampeka yigeze kuba minister w' ubutabera araza ambwira abapadiri bo mwiseminari ati ariko ubundi aba Bantu bari hano mwabohereje bagataha ngo ariko ubundi ubu ntabwo mufitemo inyenzi . ||| Interahamwe came , first a man called mbonampeka who used to be the minister of justice came and said to the priests of the seminary , why do n't you let these people go back home ? Do n't you have cockroaches among them ?
Abapadiri baramubwira bati abantu bari aha bose ni abakirisitu bacu nta nyenzi zirimo kandi ntabwo twabohereza icyo bahunze ntikirarangira . ||| The priests replied to him that all the people they had there were their Christians and no there were no cockroaches among them and that they can n't send the people home since the threat that caused them to seek refuge was still eminent .
Rwose hariho intambara ati reka bagume aha ngaha ntacyo babaye nibirangira bazataha ati mwanze mwanze kubarekure ati se mwabaretse ko tubaha abasirikare bo kubarinda . ||| There is still a war going on out there , let them stay here they are ok when its all over they will go back home . So you do n't want to let them go ? Let them go and we will give them soldiers to protect them , mbonapeka said .
Baravuga bati ariko abo Bantu bo kubarinda ntabwo bajya barinda buri muntu ati nibabarindire ahangaha aho bari . ||| Those people who are going to protect them can not protect every single one of them , let them protect them from here .
Mbonampeka aragenda hashize akanya gato cyane tubona aragarutse n' abasirikare baba padiri baba barabarashe . ||| Mbonampeka went away and after a short while he came back with soldiers and shot the priests .
Bari abapadiri babahutu umwe yari na mwishya wa musenyeri nsengiyumva yitwaga naniya rugasira undi we ananiya ubwo yahise apfa ako kanya . ||| They were Hutu priests ; one was bisop nsegiyumva 's nephew , he was called naniya rugasira and the other was ananiya , he died on the spot .
Uwitwa ndereya nubu ngubu arahari aba hariya muri saint michel baba baguye aho ubwo noneho bahita bavuga ngo uziko ari umuhutu wese nafate irangamuntu ye asohoke . ||| One who is called andre now lives at St. Michael 's , they died on the spot . So they said whoever is Hutu walk out with your identity card .
Noneho batangira kwivangura umuhutu akerekana indangamuntu nutayerekanye byabaga bigaragara agasohoka . ||| So people started walking out showing their identity cards and the ones who did n't show it , it was still visible .
Abashatse kwihishamo babana babasore babatutsi bagiye babarasira ku irembo amasasu atangiye kuvuga ubwo natwe tugumye aho ngaho biratuyobeye abana banjye babiri babahungu bakuru babona abandi barimo barasoka noneho baraza baratureba aho twari twicaye . ||| Young Tutsi men who tried to hide in the crowd were shot from the gate . We did n't know what to do , two of my older boys so the other people going out and came to see us where we were seated .
Baradupopera baratubwira ngo tuzahurira mu ijuru bo bakoze icyo gusimbuka igipangu bariruka bagwa inyuma na musaza wange umwe . ||| They waved goodbye at us and said that we weill meet in heaven , they jumped the fence and ran away with one of my brothers .
Abandi tuguma aho ngaho ku itari ya cyenda burira ku itariki ya cumi interahamwe zirirwa ziza aho ngaho kureba uko tumeze turi mu masengesho gusa mbese umuntu yumvaga byarangiye . ||| We stayed there on the 9th , on the 10th the Interahamwe kept coming to see how we were praying , we knew that it was over for us .
Tutabona aho tunyura hanze hose hari amabariyeri ubwo ku icumi burira kuri cumi nimwe mugitondo mugihe cyo mu ma saa tatu nibwo interahamwe zaje . ||| We did n't see any way out , there were roadblocks all over , on the 11th in the morning around 9 am that 's when the Interahamwe came .
Nyinshi cyane baraza baratubaza bati amafaranga ya habyarimana mwayikwije muri inkotanyi muri inyenzi muduhe amafaranga y' umubyeyi wacu . ||| There were very many and said , you took all of Habyarimana 's money when your Inkotanyi and cockroaches , give us our father 's money .
Ati kandi uwo dusangana n' igiceri turamwica ubwo ngwee n' umugabo nta kintu twari dufite uretseko twari twagerekeranyije imyenda gusa nta ni giceri twari dufite . ||| And whoever we find with even a coin will be killed , me and my husband did n't have anything except wearing a lot of clothes , we did n't have any money on us .
Nuko abayafite barayatanga ariko ntabwo ariyo bashakaga mubyukuri byari ukwiyenzi barangije bashaka gutera grenade aho ngaho twari turimo . ||| So whoever had money gave it away , but they did n't really want money they were just toying with us . After that they tried to throw a grenade where we were .
Noneho grenade haza umukobwa wari wambaye ibintu by' amashara nundi mugabo wari ufite umuheto n' imyambi hari amazina bari bafite . ||| And then a lady who was wearing clothes with pearls came in with another man who had a bow with arrows , they had a list with some names .
Hari uwitwa pasteri na rukanika n' umugabo wange na nkundabarashe ariko we ntibamuhamagaraga cyane bahamagaraga pasteri na rukanika . ||| On the list was a man called pastor , rukanika , nkundabarashe and my husband , but they did n't call out my husband a lot , they called out for pastor and rukanika .
Noneho hakaba hari undi musore witwaga mutsinzi nawe baramuhigaga noneho bamwambika kuvureri baramutwikira amera nk' umudamu . ||| There was also another young man called mutsinzi that they were looking for , they put a bead cover on him which made him look like a woman .
Arangije we abasohokamo ariruka yirutse baramurasa noneho baba babonye umugabo wanjye ngo dore nayanyenzi iruta izindi ngo haguruka baramuhagurutsa . ||| He tried to run away but they shot him , and then they saw my husband and said , here is the head of all the cockroaches , stand up , they said .
Bahagurutsa n' abana banjye babakobwa babiri barabasohokana babajyana hanze njyewe ntibambona nari negamye inyuma y' abandi badamu . ||| They also told my two daughters to stand up and took them outside but they did n't see me because I was behind some other women .
Noneho ngo abo bana banjye babakobwa ngo bashaka kubaviyora ariko iyo n' inkuru nabwiwe na pasteri kuko yararokotse . ||| And then they tried to rape my daughters , pastor told me this since he survived .
Yabarebaga aho yari yihishe noneho barababwira bati se murashaka kudufata murashaka kudukorera ibintu nimutwice n' ubundi tugomba gupfa . ||| He was watching from where he was hiding . Do you want to rape us and hurt us , go ahead and kill us we are supposed to die anyway , my daughters said .
Noneho uwo mukobwa abambura imyenda yabo ahita ayambara bari bambaye amapantalo arangije arababwira ngo nimugende murapfira rimwe n' abandi ntawe ugiye gupfusha umwanya ubusa ||| The woman removed their clothes and wore them , they were wearing trousers . She said to them , go back you will die at the same time with everyone else no one is going to waste anytime .
Babagarura munzu babagaruye munzu wa mukobwa aba arambonye ati twasohoye umwana twibagirwa nyina ati kuramo iyo myenda barampagarikiye imyenda nyikuramo nta muntu wayinkuragam . ||| They brought them back inside the house and then the lady saw me and said , we took the child and forgot the mother remove all your clothes . They watched as I removed all my clothes .
Nkuramo imyenda yose nsigarana agakanzu nari nambaye ndayimuhereza baragenda nka nyuma y' iminota nk' icumi nibwo bagarutse barasa umugore witwa makurata ni n' umugore wuwo mugabo witwa Pasteur . ||| I removed all my clothes and gave them to her as they walked away and only remained with a small dress I had on . After around 10 mins that 's when they came back and shot a woman called makurata , the wife of pastor .
Bamurasa amaguru baramubwira ngo nahaguruke kandi bamurashe amaguru bagenda bamukurura natwe baradusohora . ||| They shot her legs and asked her to stand up when they had shot her legs ; they dragged her as they took us all out .
Mubyukuri buri muntu ngirango ubanza yari afite abantu babiri bo kumwica bari benshi cyane baradusora batujyana mu kibuga baratubwira ngo nituryame . ||| They were so many I think each one of us had two people to kill him , they took us in a field that was there and asked us to lie down .
Wanze kuryama bakagutema uhagaze byose byari kimwe turaryamye mperuka uko naryamye naramye mfatanye mukiganza n' umwana wanjye w' umukobwa . ||| If you did n't lie down they would hack you with a machete , it was all the same whether you lied down or stood , we lied down . My last memory is that I lied down holding hands with my daughter .
Abandi nabo mbashyira iruhande rwange mbese numvaga batamva iruhande nuko turaryama twubitse inda batwerekaga position turi buryamemo bari bafite ukuntu bari bubigenze . ||| And I put the others on my side , I did n't want to part with them , they told us to lie down with our stomachs on the ground , they knew how they wanted it done .
Ikintu mperuka nuko kuryama nongeye kugira ubwenge mbona barantemaguye ubwo badutemye ari nko ku itariki cumi nimwe bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi nebyiri nibwo imvura yaguye numva mbaye nk' umuntu ukangutse ||| My last memory was lying on the ground I regained consciousness only to see that I was hacked , I think it was on the 11th , at around 6pm is when it started raining and I felt like I was waking up .
Ariko negutse numva simbasha kweguka umutwe wajanjaguritse amenyo yasohotse mbese nuzuye amaraso ahantu hose ngerageza guhaguruka ndongera nikubita hasi interahamwe ziba ziraje . ||| But trying to lift my head I could n't , my head was wide open and my teeth outside , soaked in blood all over . I tried to stand up and then I fell on the ground again , the Interahamwe came back .
Ziza ziza kureba noneho abagihumeka kuko batemaguye abantu bose noneho bakajya baza bagaterura bagakubita hasi , bagaterura imyenda bagakubita hasi ||| They came to see who was still breathing , they had hacked everyone so they would just lift someone off the ground throw them back down to see who was still alive .
Nuko baragenda bigeze nijoro ngenda negura mbona byanga ubwonko bwari bwasohotse nanjye aho batemye bwagombaga kuba bwasohotse . ||| So they walked around and then at night I tried to lift myself up but it was very hard , I think my brain was out where they had hacked and cut me .
Nuko ari Imana yankijije kuko aho bantemye ni nkaho bari batemye abandi bose . ||| It 's just that God kept me otherwise they had hacked me just like everyone else .
Nuko ndavuga nti ubu nabo baraza guhembuka nti jyewe se ko nahembutse kandi bari bantemye . ||| So I thought to myself that the others will also wake up since I had also woken up after being hacked .
Nicara aho ngaho muri iyo mirambo ngiye kubona mbona za nterahamwe ziragarutse . ||| I sat there among all those corpses and then all of a sudden the Interahamwe came back .
Ngenda ngiye kumywa amazi igiye kunkubita umupanga indi iramubwira iti ariko se uyu mugore igihe watemeye ntiwahaze . ||| I went to drink water and then as one of the Interahamwe was about the hack me with a machete another asked him , you have hacked this woman so many times are n't you satisfied ?
Ngo ntago ariho ngo nanabaho ngo azicwe n' agahinda ngo mureke . ||| She is n't really alive and even if she lives let her die of sorrow , leave her alone .
Baragenda ndangije mbona umupadiri wari uhagaze imbere ya chapelle ubwo umurambo wuwo nguwo ananiya niho bari bawushyize ahagaze k' umuryango . ||| They went away and then I saw a priest standing in front of a praying room that 's where they had put ananiya 's corpse .
Ngenda musanga tuziranye ariko aranyoberwa kubera ukuntu nari nabaye ndamubwira nti se wampishe aho ngaho nti ko hano bari kuza kandi ko bari bunyice nabi . ||| I went towards him , I knew him but he did n't recognize me because of the way I had become , I asked him to hide me inside since the Interahamwe were coming back and they were going to kill me badly .
Ati naha baravuze ngo baraza mu kanya bankureho ati ahubwo jya hariya muruyuzi . ||| They have said that they are coming in a short while to kill me go and hide in that garden with fruits , he said .
Hari jardin yari iri mbere ya chapelle iriho inzuzi nama epinali . ||| There was a garden that was in front of the praying room that had spinach and some other plants .
Ninjiramo niba ariwe wantwikiriye uruyuzi ni ari Imana icyo nzicyo nzicyo nuko bagarutse kunshaka ngo bandangize bakambura . ||| I went there , I do n't know if he is the one that covered me with those plants or God but all I know is that they came back looking for me to finish me off and they could n't find me .
Bahita bagenda bavuga ngo ariko se wa mugore wari uraha ngo agiye he ngo aciye he se ko adakinguye ? ||| They walked away saying , where is the woman that was here , where did she go since the priest did n't let her in ?
Baranshaka ngo yewe ngo niba akinariho ngo ntago ejo azagaruka ndara muri urwo ruyuzi bigejeje mugitondo nko mu ma saa kumi nimwe . ||| They looked for me and then said , even if she is still alive she is not coming back tomorrow . I spent the night there and then in the morning around 5am .
Nsubira muri ya mirambo ndongera ndeba abana banjye bose nkasanga ubwonko bwabo bwasohotse ndeba umugabo . ||| I went back and looked at the corpses , looking at my children and I could see their brains , I looked at my husband .
We nkabura ahantu bamutemye ariko yapfuye yari afatanye nundi mugenzi we mu ntoki bapfuye bafatanye . ||| I could n't see where they had hacked him but he died holding another man 's hand , they died holding each others hands .
Nuko ndagaruka nicaramo muri iyo mirambo ndicara ngeze aho ndavuga nti ariko se ubu ndicara . ||| So I sat among the corpses and then after a while I asked myself what I was doing .
Ngeze aho ndavuga nti ariko se ubu ndicara aha ndahakora iki noneho nzenguruka hahandi hose ngeze aho ndavuga ngo reka basi njye hariya muri toilette . ||| So I asked myself what I was doing among the corpses and then I walked around and then decided to go in the toilet .
Mbe ariho njya noneho naravugaga nti noneho nibaza uretse no kunyica barankorera n' ibindi byose birenze no kwica nkumva mfite ubwoba bwa viol . ||| Let me hide in the toilet , I was thinking to myself that if they return except killing me they were also going to do other bad things , I was really afraid they were going to rape me .
Nuko ndagenda njya muri toilette z' abanyeshuri narebye iyanduye cyane aba ariyo njyamo . ||| So I went in the student 's toilets , I looked for the filthiest and went in it .
Nti ibyo aribyo byose aha nibaza bagasanga handuye ntabwo bahajya mpagarara imbere y' urugi koko niko byagenze . ||| I said to myself that if they come to use the bathroom they will n't go in the dirtiest , I stood behind the door and that is exactly what happened .
Barakomeje bakajya baza aho ngaho bakaza bakituma ariko yayindi ntibayizemo . ||| They kept coming to use the toilets but they did n't enter in the one I was in .
Noneho hashize iminsi nk' itatu bagendaga basubira muntumbi ariko bareba niba nta warokotse . ||| After around three days they were still going through the bodies checking if there were no survivors .
Hashize nk' iminsi nk' itatu nibwo mbonampeka yazanaga essence arabarundanya barabatwika nkumva barabivuga ndaho muri toilette . ||| After three days is when mbonampeka brought fuel , piled up all the corpses and then burnt them , I heard them saying it from the toilet .
Bararundanya baratwika bacukura aho ngaho imbere ya chapelle babashyiramo barenzaho itaka baragenda . ||| They piled and burnt them and then dug a hole in front of the praying room and threw them in and then covered it and left .
Ariko ubwo nkajya mvuga nti wenda hari umwana wanjye uriho nkuko nanjye ndiho kuko ukuntu bari bangize ntago nagombaga kuba ndiho . ||| But I kept saying to myself that may be one my children was alive just like I was , because the way they had made me I was n't meant to be alive .
Ubundi nkavuga nti ba bana banjye buriya birukanse bo hari uwarokotse mbese nihishaga mvuga ngo hari uwarokotse . ||| And then I would say that may be my boys who ran away at least there is one who survived , I hid myself because I thought there was a survivor .
Nuko mbaye aho muri toillete iminsi ibiri itatu nta kintu nywa amaraso yamvuyemo yaravuye yarakamye . ||| So I stayed in that toilet two three days without drinking anything , I had lost so much blood till there was no more to bleed .
Nuko k' umunsi wa gatanu nibwo haje umwana wigaga aho ngaho mu iseminari nawe bari baratemye intumbi ziramugwira ariko ntibamutema ariko basa nabamukomeretsa akantu gatoya . ||| On the fifth day is when a student from that seminary came , they had hacked people and corpses fell on him but they did n't really hack him but he was wounded a little bit .
Ku kiganza nuko abantu bakoraga aho ngaho mu iseminari baramuhisha bamuhisha mugikoni cyabo bamutwikiriza ibintu ariko abaje gusahura barabiterura . ||| On the hand , people that worked in the seminary hid him in their kitchen and covered him with some supplies but the people who came to loot took them .
Ariko ntibamubona nibwo yahise aza aho ngaho nari ndi rero muri toilete yumva ndahirita n k' umuntu ugiye gupfa . ||| But they did n't see him , that 's when he came where I was in the toilet and he heard someone breathing faintly like I was going to die .
Ararunguruka arungurutse arambona niwe watangiye kumpa amazi yo kumywa akajya akoza akantu ku rurimi agatonyanza . ||| He peeped through and saw me ; he is the one who gave me water to drink . He would give me tiny little droplets on my tongue .
Akambwira ati numywa menshi arakwica tubaye aho ngaho muri toilette haza kuzamo n' abandi bana . ||| He would say to me that if I drink a lot , the water would kill me . We stayed in that toilet and were joined by other children .
Mbega twahavuye turi nk' abantu nka batanu bahaza buhoro buhoro ubwo twabayemo kugeza ku itariki ya 01/05 nibwo baturokoye baragenda umwana umwe waje wigaga mu iseminari nawe wari uturutse iruhanga . ||| More people kept coming slowly ; by the time we left we were around five people . We stayed there until may 1st , that 's when they helped us from there ; we were also joined by another young boy @/ girl who also studied in the seminary .
Sinzi aho yakuye ikintu niba ari icyuma niba ari urwembe rushaje niwe wanyogoshe imisatsi yarafashe mu bisebe ariko imisatsi kuyikuramo biramunanira . ||| I do n't know where he got a knife or a razor blade , he is the one that shaved me , my hair was stuck in my wounds and he could n't remove it .
Abaganga b' inkotanyi nibo bamvuye batangiye kumvurira indera haraboze nange ubwange sinarinziko nzakira cyangwa ngo ni nkira ngo mbe muzima . ||| The Inkotanyi doctors are the ones that treated my wounds ; they started treating me from Ndera . My wounds were rotten and I did n't think that they would heal or even if they healed that I would be normal again .
Ariko rero baramvuye bageze aho bajyana n' ibyumba niho navuriwe ubwo rero abana banjye bose uko ari batandatu n' umugabo wanjye na basaza banjye n' umugore wa musaza wange . ||| But they treated me and then they took me to Byumba , that 's where I was treated from . So all my six children , my husband , my brothers and my sister @-@ in @-@ law .
Bose barapfuye ariko muri uko gupfa ntabwo narinziko bose bapfuye numvaga abana babiri bashobora kuba bariho naravugaga nti ntago bapfuye rwose barirutse . ||| They are all dead , but I did n't know that they were all dead . I thought that my two sons were alive , I kept saying to myself that they ran away , they are not dead .
Wenda buriya babayeho nkajya mpora ndumva bariho ndetse umuntu aza no kumbwira ngo hari umwana wange w' umukobwa uhari . ||| I kept thinking that maybe they are alive , there is even someone who told me that my daughter was alive .
Ndamubwira nti se ari hehe bamwe bati ari ikabuga abandi bati kuri goma mbese yari yarabaye simbizi . ||| So I asked them , where is she ? Some would say kabuga , others would say goma , I did n't really know what to make of it .
Nuko ariko biza kugaragara ko ntabo nyine hanyuma mba ibyumba twagiye ahantu hitwaga niba ari muri social . ||| But I realized that she was not alive , so I lived in Byumba at a place I think that was called social .
Noneho musaza wanjye wo kwa maman wacu yari ari ibyumba akora kuri prefecture niwe waje kuhankura aranjyana aramfasha . ||| So one of my cousin @-@ brother from my mother 's side is the one that moved me from there and started helping me .
Ariko ubwo ngubwo tuva indera nabonye ukuntu abana banjye bapfuye ndavuga nti . ||| But when we were coming from Ndera I saw they way my children had died and said .
Kuko hari n' abandi bana barokotse nkavuga nti hari abarokotse wenda barabatwaye nange reka ntware aba babandi . ||| Maybe someone took my children adopting and helping them , even me let me help some .
Mbese nari narahahamutse numva abana nta mwana ugomba kubabara nuko ubwo nageze ibyumba mfite abana bagera kuri batanu ubwo musaza wange agiye kuntwara . ||| I had been traumatized I did n't want any child to suffer so I reached Byumba when I had around five children when my cousin @-@ brother was coming to take me .
Bamwe mbajyana muri orphelinat undi umwe muha umuntu w' umusirikari aragenda amwigirira kadogo . ||| I took some of them in an orphanage ; I gave the other one to a soldier who turned him into a kadogo @/ child soldier .
Nuko intambara irangiye rero ngaruka mu matongo ariko nsanga barahashenye barahamaze hanyuma rero umwana mbereye nyinawabo . ||| After the war I came back home but they were just ruins , they had destroyed everything , one of my nephews .
Niwe watubohoreje inzu njyamo n' abandi bana babavandimwe be jyamo turabana . ||| He is the one that got a a house for us , I went in with some of his siblings .
Mbabera nyina bambera abana hanyuma baza kubona umuvandimwe wabo abatwara hanze . ||| I became their mother but they got a relative who took them abroad .
Ariko sinigeze ncika intege ntago nigeraga numva nabaho nta mwana mfite ibyo byose nabagaho nararyaga kandi nari mukuru nari nshoboye kubishaka . ||| I never got to a point where I felt discouraged and did n't want to live without a child . I was mature and able to look for what I needed to eat .
Ariko nkumva umwana atabasha kwishakishiriza icyarya nkumva iteka agomba kubana n' umubyeyi . ||| I felt that a child would n't be able to get what to eat on his @/@ her own and hence always had to live with a parent .
Ufite ukwamera ni muri ubwo buryo rero nagiye nshaka abana b' imfubyi tukabana ubonye abe akabasanga utabafite akansanga . ||| That 's how I got orphans and took care of them and when they would find their family they would go and stay with them and if not they stay with me .
Aha wambwiyeko igitero cyaje kubica mwari muri indera ? ||| You told me that the people that came to kill you were in Ndera ?
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu mu iseminari . ||| Hummmm , at the seminary .
Noneho nareba noneho nareba n' ahantu mwari mutuye biragaragarako harimo akanya aho babiciye izo nterahamwe nizari zivuye aho mwari mutuye cyangwa niza handi ? ||| Looking at where you lived its evident that it 's a long distance from where they killed you from . Were those Interahamwe from the region where you lived or from somewhere else ?
Yewe iby' interahamwe rero baraguranaga abi ndera bakajya I kanombe ab' I kanombe bakajya I kanombe nkubwo ngubwo rwose interahamwe zishe aho ngaho mu iseminari urebye nizikanombe . ||| The Interahamwe would take turns , those from Ndera would go to Kanombe , and those from Kanombe would go to Ndera . The Interahamwe that killed form the seminary must have been from Kanombe .
Nizi ikanombe zari kumwe n' abasirikari ariko rero nab' iwacu kuko abana banjye bakuru barahunze basubira kumusozi w' iwacu . ||| Even those from Kanombe were with soldiers , also those from our region , because my eldest sons fled and went back on our hill where we lived .
Na musaza wange umwe niho baguye , niho baguye ariko ntabwo nari narigeze mbimenya . ||| With my one brother that 's where they died from but I did n't know about it .
Nahoraga nshakisha muri mirongo icyenda na karindwi niho twagiye mugikorwa cyo gushyingura amagufa yari yandagaye k' umusozi . ||| I kept looking for them , in 1997 is when we went to bury the remains that had been scattered on our hill .
Ndi mubantu bambere bihutiye gushyingura mvuga ngo ndashyingura abana banjye ndashyingura abavandimwe ariko naje gusanga ko ataribo twashyinguraga . ||| I am among the first people that were eager to bury , saying that I am burying my children and the remains of my relatives , but I later found out that they were not the ones we had buried .
Turongera na none indi nshuro imwe turongera turashyingura bwa kabiri . ||| We buried again for the second time .
Bambwira ngo bari aha naha aho banyeretse amagufa nkagenda gutoragura nta bimenyetso nashakaga nahitaga mvuga nti ubu nibo rwose . ||| They would tell me that they are in this particular place , wherever they would show me bones I would not look for signs and I would think to myself finally I have got them .
Ejo bundi mu bihumbi bibiri na gatanu ngirango nibwo twashyinguye hari mukwezi kwa kane . ||| Recently in April 2005 is when we buried .
Umuntu aranyemeza ati nihariya noneho rwose ni nange wanabishyinguriye ngwino njye kubaguha ndagenda ndataburura abantu makumyabiri na batatu nabashyinguye ku gisozi . ||| Someone convinced me that he knew where they were buried saying he was the one who had buried them , lets go I show them to you . I excavated twenty three people and buried them at gisozi .
Nama sanduka manini cyane n' imisaraba yanditseho ayo mazina yabo nuko ariko biza kugaragara ko yambeshyaga sinzi icyo yaragamije . ||| They are very big graves with crosses written on their names but I realized that he was lying to me .
Niba yari abizi cyangwa Atari abizi sinzi ngewe nayobowe ibyo aribyo . ||| I do n't know if he knew what he was doing or not but I was really shocked .
Mu makuru ya gacaca niho haje umwana wabanaga n' abana banjye bangana niwe wavuze ibyo aribyo ni nawe wavuze uko babataye muri toilette . ||| n gacaca si where child who knew my children , he @/@ she was there age mate , he @/@ she is the one that clarified and said that they were thrown in a latrine .
Nibwo babatabururaga mu kwezi kwa cumi tubashyingura mu kwa cumi na biri noneho ari ariko n' ibimenyetso byabo ndabibona n' amarangamuntu . ||| That 's when they were excavated in October and we buried them in December and I saw signs that it was really them , like identity cards .
Amakarita y' ishuri imyenda yabo uretseko gusa bari barabaye utugufa barashengaguritse . ||| School cards and their clothes but they were just bones because they had decomposed .
Nuko tubakura muri toilette ya metero cumi n' esheshatu n' abandi Bantu babajugunyanyemo . ||| So we got them from a sixteen meter pit latrine with other people that were thrown in with them .
Binatuma n' abantu bo kumusozi w' iwacu dutaburura abaribo nyabo imibiri yaragaragaraga n' ibyangombwa twashyinguye abantu Magana abiri na mirongo itanu . ||| And for that cause on our hill we buried two hundred and fifty people knowing exactly who was who because their bodies were visible and their identity cards .
Twataburuye abantu Magana abiri na mirongo itanu icyo gihe kandi abantu bahariya iwacu baratubeshyaga tugataburura abataribo buri gihe . ||| That day we excavated two hundred and fifty people , before that people kept lying to us and we would excavate the wrong people .
Twashyinguye inshuro nyinshi dushyingura abntu batari abacu ariko n' abanyarwanda twashyinguraga . ||| We buried a lot of times burying people who we were not related to but we were burying Rwandans .
Ntabwo tubyicuza uretseko badushinyaguriye bihagije guhora washyinguye wataburuye washyinguye . ||| We do n't regret it but they toyed with us , always excavating and burying .
Ushyingura abataribo . ||| Burying the wrong people .
Noneho ikintu ngarutse kuri icyo kintu cyo gushyingura incuro nyinshi ushyingura abantu bataribo abantu babarangira abo Bantu n' abantu mwari muturanye ? ||| Let 's talk again about burying a lot of times burying the wrong people , the people who were directing you on where to excavate were they your neighbours ?
Iyo mwitegereje mubona sinzi ukuntu mwabisobanurira umuntu ngo yaguye aha wenda anakubeshya . ||| Looking closely , how would someone say that somebody died from a certain place even when they are lying to you ?
Abantu babarangiraga n' abantu mwari musanzwe muturanye ? ||| The people who were telling you where to excavate where your neighbours ?
N' abantu twabanaga rwose twari duturanye cyane uwo we wandangiiye akambwira ko yabashyinguye ni numucikacumu . ||| Yes they were our neighbours ; the one who even told me that he had buried my children himself was even a genocide survivor .
Namubajije icyo yashatse kugeraho dushaka kubipfa ariko ndavuga nti ntabwo ari ngombwa ko tubipfa . ||| I asked him why he did and it almost turned us into enemies but then I said to myself that there was no point .
Ababishe nibo batumye no kumbeshya bibaho iyo njya kuba umuntu w' umugome mba naramukurikiye bigatinda ariko naravuze uwabishe niwe watumye nibi byose bibaho . ||| The ones who killed them are the ones that caused the lies , had I been a bad person I would have probably had followed him around in anger for a long time but I said to myself that the one who killed them is the cause and root for all this .
Nti izi ningaruka za jenocide zikomeje kunkurikirana ariko noneho we urumva ko bwari incuro ya kabiri kandi n' ubwambere naramubwiraga nti ngiye . ||| I said that these were the consequences of the genocide on me , it was the second time , before I use to tell him that
Ngiye kwibuka nta kintu nakoraga nta mubwiye nk' umucikacumu mwenewacu nkamubwira nti uyu munsi nzakora amasengesho yo kwibuka akaza . ||| I am going to remember , I did n't do anything without telling him as a fellow survivor , telling him that today I am going to pray and remember and he would come .
Noneho ndamubaza nti ariko se kubera iki ugeze iki gihe cyo utarambwira ko aba bana bashyinguye aho hantu akabwira abantu ko ngo yangaga ko mpahamuka . ||| I even asked him why he had taken so long without telling me where my children were buried and he said that he did n't want me to get traumatized .
Nkamubwira nti se nari guhahamuka nti nubundi mu kwa kane buri tariki cumi n' imwe nkora amasengesho yo kubibuka . ||| And I told thim that I could n't get traumatized it was all the same since every 11th of april I would have prayers to remember them .
Kuki utaretse ngo mpahamukire kimwe ariko mbashyingure nuko muri gacaca rero uwo mwana abivuze byaho babashyize noneho . ||| Why did n't you let me get traumatized once and for all but atleast bury them , so in gacaca that child said where they were buried .
Muhamagaye ngirango uwo mwana niwe umbeshya twari tugiye gutongana nukwitesha agaciro nanga gutongana nawe no guhangana nawe . ||| I called him and even thought that the child is the one who was lying to me , we almost started arguing but I realized I would be disrespecting myself and did n't want any confrontation with him .
Ndamwihorera ndavuga nti ibi byose n' ingaruka zingeraho reka mpangane nabyo nkuko nsanzwe ariko ikindi cyo nuko muri za mirongo cyenda na karindwi . ||| I ignored him and said that I was just feeling the consequences of the genocide so I decided to fight them they way I normally fight but the other thing is that in 1995 .
Abadutaburuje iyo misozi yose tuyiruka n' abaturanyi ni nababigizemo uruhare mu kubica Atari no kwica abanjye gusa no kwica abantu bo kuri ako gasozi bose . ||| Those who misled us in excavating all those bodies on the different hills are the ones who participated in killing the not only my people but all the people on that hill .
Ubu muri gacaca aho bagenda baburanira niho bagenda babivuga abababonye bakabashinja . ||| Now in gacaca whenever they go to defend themselves that 's when they say it and those who saw them accuse them .
Nabo ubwabo bakishinja bagashinjanya ariko rero bagaragaje ubugome bukabije n' agashinyaguro gakabije . ||| They even accuse themselves and each other ; they displayed a lot of hate and torture that was just imaginable .
Gusa gacaca irimo iragenda ibatahu abafunzwe bakarega abatarafunzwe abafunzwe bagashinja abafunguwe . ||| But gacaca is exposing them all , they are turning on each other , those who are in jail denounce those who were not put in jail and those who are in jail also denounce those who are being released .
Niko iwacu bimeze . ||| That 's how things are in our region .
Reka ngaruke kuri abo bana abandi bo twumvise ko baguye indera nyuma bakaza no kubatwika ubwo birumvikana ........ ||| Lets talk again about the other children who were killed from Ndera and were later burnt , we can tell that ...
Aho bashyinguye rero ngewe niba ari uko nari ngihahamutse cyane muri mirongo cyenda na karindwi nibwo twabakoreye amasengesho yambere . ||| Where they buried them , I do n't if it 's because I was still very traumatized in 1997 is when we first said prayers for them .
Ariko ubwo ni nange werekanye aho babashyize hari ikigunda rwose n' amafoto yaho . ||| I am the one who showed where they were thrown there is a bush even pictures of the place .
Y' ukuntu nagiye mpufira niki birahari ariko bavuze ngo mutaburure ngewe ndavuga nti oya sinshaka ko mudaburura urebye rero ntabandi Bantu benshi baharokokeye . ||| And the way I watered the place but when they said to excavate the bodies I said no , I do n't want you to excavate them ; they were n't many other people that survived from there .
Ninge nuwo mwana umwe ubu ari mu busuwisi ubu ari no muri ibuka yahariya yitwa sezari turavuga tuti mwikwirirwa mubataburura rwose baranabatwitse . ||| It was me and the one boy who is now in Switzerland , he is a member of ibuka there , his name is cesar . We asked them not to excavate them since they had also burnt them .
Nimuhakore neza hanyuma abapadiri batwemerera kuhubaka urwibutso rwiza ruraho rurahari iteka kuri cumi na rimwe z' ukwa kane tujya kubibuka . ||| We asked if they could make the place look good and the priests promised us they were going to build a beautiful memorial , its there and every 11th of april we go there to commemorate .
Tukagira misa nuko ruraho ngaho rwose imbere ya chapelle . ||| And we have mass and pray , the memorial is just in front of the praying room .
Ugeranije kubantu bake barokotse aho ngaho ni wowe nuwo mwana ndumva n' abantu bake cyane ugereranije n' abantu bari aho ngaho biciye hariya . ||| If you estimate on the few people who survived from there it 's you and that boy , it seems like you are very few compared to all the people that were killed from there .
Yewe bari nka Magana ni hafi Magana ane urebye kuko amashuri yose yari yuzuye hari n' agasare kari kuzuye gusa abari abahutu baje gusohokamo baragenda ariko ntago aribo bari benshi . ||| They were in hundreds around four hundred because all the classrooms were full , there was even a hall that was full , the hutus later went out but they were few .
Abari benshi n' abatutsi bari bahahungiye . ||| The majority were the Tutsis seeking refuge .
Nukuvuga ko mu Bantu Magana ane bari bahari abarokotsemo ntabwo barenga icumi . ||| So you mean that in the four hundred seeking refuge the survivors are not more than ten ?
Aho ngaho mu iseminari oya ntabo nuwo mwana sezari nange hari nutundi twana twabanje kugenda twiruka ariko abo tuzi twibara turi babiri . ||| At the seminary it 's just me and cezar , they are some kids who also ran away , but the ones we are sure of and count are me and cezar .
Muri izo ntumbi nitwe twavuye muri izo ntumbi . ||| We are the only ones who came out of the corpses .
Ngarutse kuri babana bawe baguye hariya imasoro waba warigeze umenya abantu babishe cyangwa se n' uburyo babishemo wenda uretse no kubata muri toilette ? ||| If we talk about your children that died in Masoro did you get to know who killed them or how they were killed except the fact that they were thrown in the pit latrine ?
Muri gacaca rero barabivuga ariko iyo babivuga bavuga abapfuye mubyukuri n' abazima bahari mubyukuri nabo babigizemo uruhare cyakora ikigaragara nuko abo base abashijwe ubu ngubu barafashwe na gacaca . ||| In gacaca they talk about the people who died but even the ones who are there played a major role in it but what is clear is that whoever is involved were arrested because of gacaca .
Usibye hari ikintu cyo babanzaga gutema umuntu bakamuta mu musarane sinzi niba warigeze umenya niba barabataye mu musarani ari bazima cyangwa niba barabanje bakabatemagura . ||| They normally first hacked people before throwing them in the pits , did you get to know if your children were thrown in the pit alive or after being hacked .
Umwana wabitubwiyemo amakuru yatubwiye yuko barabatemye umuhungu wange wa kabiri uwo bitaga dede yitwaga jean bosco . ||| The boy who told us said that they were hacked , my second son , the one they called dede his name was jean bosco .
Yakundanaga nuwo mwana cyane uwo nguwo wabivuze noneho ngo bagiye kubica uwo mwana yitwa gashirabake ngo aramubwira ati gashiraba ? ||| He was a very good friend of the boy who said it his name is gashirabake , he said that when they were about to kill them he said to him , gashiraba
Twarabanye turapfuye aho tugiye nta nkweto bambara ati akira izi nkweto ujye uzinyibukiraho . ||| We 've been very good friends and we are going to die ; where we are going they do n't wear shoes , take my shoes and remember me whenever you look at them .
Ati kandi uzajye ubivuga . ||| And please tell the story .
Ati hanyuma ngo noneho bambwira abari bagiye kubica bati nimube muretse kutwica tubanze dusenge , abana ngo barasenga ngo barangije babata mu musarani . ||| And then they told those who were about to kill them to wait so that they can first pray , and when they had finished praying they threw them in the pit .
Niwe waduhayemo ayo makuru . ||| He is the one who told us all that .
Ariko ngewe ndumva nukuva ngo niba uwo mwana aba yarabashije kuba yarahawe inkweto n' umuhungu wawe nukuvaga ngo nababatemye arabazi . ||| But personally I think that if that boy was given shoes by your son it means that he even saw the ones who killed them .
Arabazi mubyukuri we aravuga ngo yahise yiruka ntabwo bemera kuvuga ngo babihagarareho neza . ||| He knows them but he says that he ran away , they do n't agree to say everything clearly .
Ngo mbese bemeze ikiriho kugirango nabasigaye batabagirira nabi aravuga ati ngewe nahise niruka akavuga ngo nuwamwirukankanye ngo akamukubita inkoni mubitugu . ||| They do n't want to state facts I think of fear that the remaining ones will hurt them . He says that he ran away and says the one who chased him away and hit him with a stick on the shoulders .
Kuvuga ngo rero ngo ntago yabonye uwamutemye ariko noneho abandi bakavuga ko ngo batemwe n' umuntu witwaga habari n' umuntu wapfuye . ||| So he says that he does n't know who killed them but others say that he was killed by a man called habari , he is dead .
Akongera bakavuga ngo ni uwitwa sebahire , sebahire nawe yarapfuye ntawe uriho wabatemye ariko bigaragarako abari aho bose barabazi ababatemye . ||| They also say that they were hacked by a man called sebahire who is also dead , there is noone who killed them who I alive but its clear that the people who are alive know who killed them .
Ariko ntawe ubavuga ngo abyemeze umwana aravuga ati yamaze kuzinkubita ndiruka ntabwo rero yavuga ati nabonye kanaka wenda amuvuze ari aho ngaho nawe yamuhiga sinzi ||| No one stands on his @/@ her word , the boy says that after he was beaten he ran away , he can n't really say that he saw someone kill , may be if he says him and he is there , he would also hunt him down , I do n't know .
We nta nubwo arongera kubura ngo kuko yanafunzwe ari umwana ariko wenda azaburana gacaca niyo izi uko izabigenza ntabwo nge mbizi . ||| He has n't even come back to court because he was imprisoned when he was still young but may be he will . Gacaca will deal with it , I personally do n't know .
None abantu birumvikana ko abantu bagushizeho ariko hari ikintu ibyo aribyo byose nta muntu ujya wibagirwa umuryango we none twagirango utubwire kumugabo wawe yari muntu ki ? ||| I understand that your whole family died but no one forgets her family , can you please tell us about your husband , what kind of man was he ?
Yari ateye ate mu mibanire ye n' abandi Bantu ikintu ujya wumva umwibukiraho udashobora gupfa kwibagirwa ? ||| How did he relate with other people and what is the one thing that you remember about him that you can not forget ?
Nta na kimwe cyatuma mwibagirw ngewe namuvuga se ngo iki kumuvuga ntago bihagije ngirango niriya photo ishora kubikwereka byonyine yari umugabo utuje . ||| There is no way I can forget him , I do n't know how I can describe him I think that picture describes a lot , he was a very calm man .
Yari umuntu ucisha make ariko ubana n' abantu bose cyane cyane nawe yakundaga abana ngirango ni nayo mpamvu yajyane n' abana . ||| He was avery humble man who easily related with everyone but especially he loved children , I think that 's why he went with our children .
Be simbizi yari umuntu wumvikana kandi ugira impuhwe cyane kuburyo yashoboraga kwiyibagirwa cyangwa akibagirwa abandi . ||| He was very easy to relate to and was very merciful ; he could easily ignore himselfo or others .
Niko yari ateye uuuuuuuu yari umuntu ukunda umuryango we cyane ngirango iyo aza kuba umugabo w' igisambo afunguwe mubyitso yari guhita yigendera akanadusiga . ||| That was his nature , he was a man that really loved his family , I think if he had been greedy when he was released from jail he would have abandoned us .
Ariko ntago yabigize yakundaga bose nta muntu yangaga yakundaga abantu baciye bugufi abantu babakene . ||| But he did n't , he loved everyone , he did n't hate anyone , he loved the poor and humble .
Wasangaga imodoka yacu ariyo itwara ababyeyi bacu hariya kwa muganga umuntu wibukagaga kubona atwaye umugore w' umukene abona agiye kubyara . ||| Our car is the one that always took all the women at the hospital , he was always careful to take the poor pregnant women at the hospital .
Akibuka kumutwarira ikintu cyo kumuhembuza amaze kubyara nta wundi wabigiraga yari umugabo mwiza . ||| And he would also remember to take something to revive them after they had given birth ; nobody else remembered he was a really nice man .
N' abana banjye kandi nuko bari abana bakunda abandi bana bagira urugwiro ntabwo nshobora kubibagirw ahubwo ngerageza kubigana bikananira . ||| My children were also like that , they loved other kids and were always warm and happy , I can n't forget them , instead I try to imitate them and fail .
Sinzi ukuntu nabivuga noneho ngewe ndashaka kuvuga aha ngaha bishe abantu bakumaraho abantu ese ..... birega bakemera n' icyaha baje kukwirega bakemere n' icyaha abo Bantu baje kukwirega wababarira ? ||| I do n't know how to say it , but here they killed all your family and finished it , if they came and confessed their fault , would you forgive them ?
Kubabarira hari amagambo abantu bihutisha kuvuga ukabona utazi nibyo aribyo ari wamuntu umanuka akagusanga ari nawe uvuga ngo uramubabariye n' ibintu bikomeye cyane . ||| To forgive , they are words that people are quick to use but it does n't even make sense . The person who asks it and you who says that you have forgiven him it 's not something easy .
Kuko ngewe uko mbona iki gihugu nicy' abanyarwanda bose ntabwo ari icyange ngenyine nta nubwo ari icy' uwacitse ku icumu wenyine ntibinashoboka . ||| Because personally the way I see this country it belongs to all Rwandans , its not just mine it 's not even for only the genocide survivor , it 's impossible .
Ntabwo icyaha gihanishwa ikindi cyaha cyangwa se ngo ubugome buhanishwe ubundi ngewe ku giti cyange nabwiye Imana ibyo nkora byose nta na kimwe nikoresha . ||| Evil is not repaid by evil ; personally I told God that I can n't do anything on my own .
Kuko ntacyo nakwishoboza byikoresheje nta nubwo naba nkiriho naba narabaye n' umusazi simbizi ariko ngewe ibyange byose mbiha Imana kuko nubwo kuva muri iyo mirambo ya bana banjye . ||| I can n't manage anything on my own , I do n't think I would even be alive , I think I would have gone mad . I surrender everything to God because to be able to get out of all the corpses of my children .
N' umugabo wange n' abavandimwe n' abatunyi bose nari nsize aho ngaho bagaramye ari intumbi sinarinziko nzabaho . ||| My husband , relatives and neighbours that were lying there dead , I did n't think I was going to live .
Nabwiye Imana ko ariyo ibizi ariyo izi impamvu yabyo ikintu rero nasabye Imana kandi yarakimpaye nayibwiyeko niba ari aba bapfuye niba hari abandi bo kubaho izampa gukunda ngakunda nta kindi kintu ndeba kuruhande . ||| I told God that He is the one in control and knows why everything happened . I asked God for something and he gave it to me , I told God that those who died and those who are alive , I asked that He may give me the power to love without focusing on anything else .
Nkakunda urukundo rwayo kuko urwange sinarubona bivuga rero ngo ngewe umuntu ansanze akabwira ati nakugiriye nabi naguha n' urugero rw' uwo mwana . ||| To love His love because personally I can n't , so which means that if someone comes and tells that they did me wrong , an example is the boy .
Wavuze ati abana bawe babataye hari sinkubeshya umutima wanjye waramwakiriye , waramwakiriye kuburyo ndamubona nkabona n' umwana wa mwana nabonaga cya gihe . ||| Who said where my children were thrown , am not lying to you but my heart has accepted him in such a way that when I look at him I see the child I once saw before .
Noneho nkavuga nti ngewe aho kugirango ndemererwe nasabye Imana kumpa umutima wagutse urimo impuhwe nkazigiirira uwo mbona azikeneye . ||| So instead of being burdened I asked God to give me a big heart so that I can offer mercy to everyone who needs it .
Niyo yaba ari umuhutu wa wundi wanyiciye ariko akaza mbona yapfuye . ||| Even if it 's a hutu who killed my family and he comes when he is broken down .
Akeneye impuhwe kubabarirwa nge namubabarira kuko ari umuntu nge ntabwo nakora ubunyamaswa nkubwe ntabwo rero aringe wabyihaye singiye kukubeshya . ||| In need of mercy and forgiveness , I would forgive him because he is a human being , I can n't do the same atrocities like he did . It 's really not by my strength that I can do this , I will n't lie to you .
Kuko ngewe ubwange ntawe ndiwe nta nicyo mba ndicyo pe ariko kuba Imana yarabonyeko abana banshizeho umubiri ukanshiraho . ||| Because on my own I am nothing and I would be nothing but the fact that God saw that my children and body were dead .
Nkakokoka ngasigara nteye isesemi ikongera ikandema umuntu yumva ashaka kunyegera mbere barampungaga abantu bambonye nyuma ya jenocide ho gato barampungaga . ||| I was disgusting and he revived me and people want to be with me when before they use to run away from me , people who saw me immediately after the genocide would avoid me .
Ntari nteye ishozi n' isesemi nta muntu wanyondoye nta muntu wagize ikintu ankorera ngo avuge ngo nakugiriye ntya . ||| I was hideous and disgusting and there 's no one who really took care of me to say they did it .
Nubwo hariho uwanyondoye nkuwo musaza wange wanjyanye akanshyira iwe ariko hatarimo imbaraga z' Imana ntabwo byari gushoboka . ||| Except my cousin @-@ brother but even for him it would n't have been possible without God 's power .
Nari gusara bivuga ngo Imana niyo yambungabunze ingira uko ndi uku nange murukundo rwayo ngomba gukora icyo insaba uwaza ansaba imbabazi ambwiza ukuri ngewe nazimuha . ||| I would have gone mad , but God kept and made me who I am today , so even me in His love I must do what He asks me to do and whoever asks me for forgiveness in truth , I would forgive them .
Ariko imbabazi za nyirarubeshwa ntazo mfite hari ibintu muri gacaca bavuga ngo nsabye imbabazi abanyarwanda bose . ||| But not forgiveness out of hypocrisy like they do in gacaca , someone coming and saying that I am asking forgiveness from every Rwandan , I do n't have that forgiveness .
Ziriya sinjya nzitanga kuko mbona aribyo bize gusa kuko ni siroga bafite izo rero ntazo mfite ariko umuntu waza agapfukama akavuga ati ibintu nakoze akabivuga abikuye k' umutima . ||| I do n't forgive those ones because I see that they are just saying it , it 's like a slogan they use I do n't have forgiveness for those ones . But if someone comes and kneels before me and says it from the depth of his heart .
Kandi iyo umuntu avuga ikintu abikuye k' umutima urabibona nazimuha ariko rero ntago bazisaba kuko usaba imbabazi nufite umutima wa kimuntu . ||| And when someone is saying something from the depth of their heart you can tell and I can forgive them , but they do n't ask for forgiveness because someone asks for forgiveness is someone with a human heart .
Ufite ubu muntu aragusanga kuko aba abona uri umuntu iyo atagusanze rero aba abona ukiri cya kindi ya kwitaga cya gihe . ||| Someone with humanity in them comes close to you because he sees that you are human , whe he does n't it 's because he thinks that you are still the thing that he called you before .
N' ubundi batwambuye ubumuntu batwita inyenzi batwita ibyo ntazi batwita ibiki nubu aracyabimbonamo ariko uwaza akanyegera ngewe nazimuha pe . ||| They dehumanized us by calling us cockroaches and other horrible names so I think they still see that in us , so whoever comes close to me , I would forgive them .
Noneho nyuma yo kumva ibintu bikomeye waciyemo urumva kuroka mu Bantu bangana kuriya noneho ukaza no kugira n' ikibazo umuryango wawe wose ukagushiraho . ||| After hearing the difficult things that you went through , surviving among all those people and your family being dead .
Ubu muri iki gihe sinzi navuga nti se murebwayire Josephine ubu muri iki gihe n' umuntu umeze ute ? N' umuntu ufite ibyiringo nubwo abantu bamushizeho mbese nyuma ya jenocide . ||| Nowadays how can I describe murebwayire Josephine , what kind of person is she even though her whole family died , is she someone with hope even though her whole family died in the genocide ?
Wadusobanurira mbese muri wowe wumva umeze ute ntabwo mbyumva ? ||| Please tell us , how do you feel deep inside because I do n't understand ?
Erega ntabwo byumvikana mu bwenge bwa muntu n' indengakamere kandi iyo bavuze indengakamere wumva ko ari ibirenze kamere muntu . ||| It does n't make sense humanly speaking , it 's beyond our human nature and when they say beyond our human nature , it means it 's not human .
Ntabwo ibyambayeho mu buzima bwanjye kuva ndi uruhinja kuva ndi umwana kugeza kuri iyi myaka mfite n' indengakamere ariko indengakamere hariho uwaremye kamere . ||| Everything that happened in my life since I was a child up to now is beyond human nature but there is someone who created human nature .
Aranshoboza urambajije rero uti ufite byiringiro ki , ibyiringiro mfite nuko ntabereyeho ngewe , ngewe nkanjye ngewe ntabwo nakagombye kuba nkiriho . ||| He enables me , you asked me if I have hope . My hope is that I am alive ; I was not supposed to be alive .
Nta nicyo naba maze ariko kuberako mbona ko hari abo mbereyeho wenda bansoroma ngomba kubaho kandi nkabaho nk' umuntu ufite ibyo nshinzwe ngakora nk' umuntu ufite inshingano . ||| I would n't even be of any use but because I see that I am living for some people who reap from me I must live and live like someone who is responsible , work like someone with responsibilities .
Kandi izo nshingano nta nubwo narinziko nzazigira nari napfuye ndazuka nukuvaga ngo muri uko kuzuka nazutse ndi undi wundi utari wa wundi . ||| I did n't think I would have those responsibilities , it means that I had died and resurrected . In resurrecting I resurrected a new being not the same person .
Nakagombye rero kwemera uko njya nkunda kubwira abantu nti Josephine yarapfuye habaho tante . ||| So I have to accept the way I always tell people that Josephine died and aunty lived .
Kuko ubu nitwa tante w' abana bose kuko umwana unsanze afite ikibazo mbasha kugikemura ndagikemura . ||| Because now I am called aunty of all the children , any child who comes to me with a problem that I can fix , I fix it .
Nkamuhumuriza nkamwumvisha ko agomba kubaho nka mutera imbaraga numva rero narasigariye kuba tante w' abana bose . ||| To confort and convince that that child must live and encourage him @/@ her , so I think I was left behind so that I may be an aunty to all the children .
Umwana unsanze afite ikibazo nshobora kugikemura ndagikemura nkamuhumuriza nkamwumvisha ko agomba kubaho . ||| A child who comes to me with a problem that I can fix , I fix it and confort them and convince him that they must live .
Nkamuremesha kandi nkamutera imbaraga numva rero narasigariye kuba maman w' abana badafite banyina . ||| I encourage and strengthen them , I feel like I was left behind so that I can be a mother to all children without mothers .
Ntabwo aringombwa ko mba mbatunze murugo rwange ariko hariho uwo mbwira nti ibi nibi ibi nibi nkabona ndamuremesheje ateye intambwe . ||| It 's not a must that I take care of them in my house but they are some I advise on certain issues and they move forward .
Hari abo mfite hano murugo ubu mfite abana batandatu mfitemo abakobwa babiri mfitemo n' abahungu bane . ||| They are some that I have here in my house . I have six children , two girls and four boys .
Harimo abo ntazi iwabo ntazi na se na nyina ntazi naho bavukiye harimo nabo umuryamo harimo na maman wambyaye ntigeze menya kuberako natakaye ndi umwana muto . ||| There are some who I do n't know their origin , I do n't know their father or mother or where they were born from , some are family including my mother I never knew her because I got lost when I was a little child .
Nkamubona jenocide irangiye batahutse mu Rwanda abo bose n' inshingano mfite ngomba kuzuza uko nzishoboye . ||| And only see her after the genocide when they returned from exile , all those are my responsibility to do all I can .
Ikindi nuko Imana yandokoye imfiteho umugambi imfasha no kuwusohoza ntiyankojeje isoni ntiyampinduye umusazi byarashobokaga . ||| The other thing is that God who kept me has a plan for my life that He helps to fulfill it , he did n't put me to shame , I would have gone crazy , and it was possible .
Batamye mu mutwe ubwonko ntibwagiye ndatekereza nukuvuga ngo ngomba kubaho nshima Imana ndatekereza nukuvuga ngo rero ngomba kubaho nshima Imana kandi nkora icyo nshoboye . ||| They hacked me in the head but I did n't loose my mind I can think , it means I must live my life thanking God and doing what I can .
N' ikintu cya girira abandi akamaro . ||| It 's something that can help others .
Abantu mwari muturanye ahantu mwari mutuye uyu munsi mubanye mute ? ||| How do you relate to the neighbours that you had befor all this , how is your relationship ?
Ese nyuma yubu bw' icanyi bwa gukozeho ndetse bukora no kubanyarwanda benshi ubu ubona hashobora kuzongera hakabaho ikintu cyo kubana nta kintu cy' urwikekwe . ||| After the genocide which affected your life and the life of many rwandans , do you think that there can be normal trustworthy relationships ?
Hagati y' abantu bishe n' abiciwe ? ||| Between the killers and victims ?
Ariko urwikekwe sinzi ngo niba ari kadafi wabivuze ngo ujye undinda incuti zange ngo abanzi ndabazi . ||| About trust I do n't know if its kadafi who said that , protect me form my friends because I already know my enemies .
Ubundi umuntu murabana ariko Imana yaduhaye ubwenge iduha gushishoza nta mpamvu yo kumuhutaza yagize ibyago mpari namutabara nk' umunyarwanda yagize ibyiza twabisangira . ||| God gave us the wisdom to think , when you live with someone there is no reason to disturb someone who is going through hard times , if I am able I can help him @/@ her as a rwandan and if they are celebrating I can celebrate with him @/@ her .
Ariko nka kenga nkagira amakenga kuberako ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo incira ishobora guhinduka inkoko ngo uyirye . ||| But I have to be careful because there is no way a cobra can turn into a cock and you eat it .
Nukuvuga ngo niba uziko mu ishyamba harimo inyamaswa ugomba kugenda uzi uko uri buhunge iyo nyamaswa . ||| It means that if you know that there is an animal or beast in the forest you must walk when your ready to run away from it .
Ukarigendamo ngewe nuko nakubwira ariko rero abaturanyi turabana ntabwo nzi kuvangura ubwo ngo umuhutu simusuhuza sinzi kugenda ntuka umuntu ngo uriya n' interahamwe . ||| But I live well with my neighbours I do n't how to segregate people saying one is hutu so I will n't greet them , or insulting someone that they are Interahamwe .
Umuntu iyo duhuye duhura mubonamo umuntu hanyuma ikibi kikaza igihe gikorewe nange nkabonako ari kibi ariko ntago njya nigizayo umuntu uwo ariwe wese . ||| When I see someone I see a human being and I only see evil when that person commits it , but I do n't push anybody away .
Nkumva umutima wanjye ukeneye kwakira buri wese uje awugana yawugana nabi simuhe umwanya . ||| My heart welcomes everyone who comes to me with good intentions , if you do n't then I do n't give you my time .
Hari muri jenocide by' umwihariko abantu babadamu hari abantu babadamu benshi bagiye bahura n' ibintu byibibazo usibye no kuba babica n' abana bakabamaraho hari nabagiye bahura n' ingorane bakabaviyora bakabanduza indwara . ||| In the genocide especially women went through a lot of difficulties , besides killing them and finishing off their children , many were raped and infected with diseases .
Usibye no kubaviyora hari nabagiye bahura n' ibikomere bikomeye kuburyo uyu munsi iyo ugiye kwitegereza usanga nge navuga nti abapfakazi benshi bafite ibibazo . ||| Besides being raped they went through a lot of fifficulties and problems that personally I think that widows have a lot of problems .
Bituruka kuri jenocide ndetse ubona binakomeye cyane uyu munsi koko nkubungubu umuntu yikoreye umutwaro w' indwara izamwica igihe iki niki . ||| As a result of the genocide , it is very difficult because you find that someone has a sickness that will kill her at some point .
Udafite uwo mutwaro jenocide yarangiye aguma mu buzima butari bwiza ubukene burakomeza bumumerera nabi aha noneho nagirango nk' umuntu nkawe w' umubyeyi . ||| If she is not burdened by disease , the genocide ended and she is probably in a lot of poverty , I woulk like you as a woman .
Wagize ikibazo bakakumaraho umuryango icyo nikindi kintu kigikomere giteye ubwoba aha nagirango umpe ishusho y' abapfakazi ba jenocide babayeho ubu bari mungaruka zikomeye cyane . ||| Who went through the same and lost your whole family which is a very difficult thing to endure , I would like you to paint a picture for us of the genocide widows who are suffering the hard consequences .
Nizo z' uburwayi wababwira iki ese sinzi ukuntu nge navuga . ||| For example disease , what would you say to them ? I do n't know how to say it .
Ubuzima bwabo uyu munsi bugeze he ? ese bameze bate ese n' abantu ubona uduhe ishusho yabyo yibyo bintu ? ||| How is their life today ? How are they doing , please give us an image of their life ?
Ikintu umbajije kirakomeye ubundi ngewe mba no mu muryango w' abapfakazi ba jenocide avega agahozo . ||| You have just asked me a very difficult question , I am part of a widows ' association called avega agahozo .
Ndi vice presidente wa kabiri ku rwego rw' igihugu ni umuryango twashinze kubera ibibazo abapfakazi bari bafite abapfakazi barimo ingeri nyinshi harimo abafashwe ku ngufu koko barwaye bandujwe sida . ||| I am the second vice @-@ president on the national level , it 's an association that we set up because among widows there are many categories . There are some who were raped and infected with HIV & AIDS .
Harimo abana babakobwa babyaye abana badashaka harimo abatemaguwe badafite ibice byo kumubiri umwe ugasanga nta kaboko afite . ||| There are some girls who gave birth to children they did n't want , they are some who were hacked and do not have some limbs , some do n't have hands .
Uwo ijisho ryavuyemo mbese harimo ubumuga butandukanye noneho rero reba aba bantu bafite ubu muga bwo mu mutima . ||| Some do n't have eyes , they are different handicaps and then they are those who are emotionally handicaped .
N' umubiri badafite aho bataha badafite inzu yo kubamo kenshi na kenshi begamiye aba bahekuye . ||| And physically they do n't have a home , without a house to live in , many times they are next door to the ones who kileed their families and injured them .
Urumva ko ari agahinda kageretse ku kandi ariko nka association yacu icyo dukora nukubatera ingabo mubitugu tubabwira tuti muhumure . ||| You understand that its adding more sorrow to an already broken heart , so our associationts goal is to stand by them and confort them telling them not to loose heart .
Kuba ukiriho nejo uzabaho tugira amahirwe amahirwe twabonye umushinga ubafasha kubona iriya miti igabanya ubukana bwa sida . ||| Telling them that the fact that they are still alive that they will continue to live , we are lucky that we got a project that helps them with anti @-@ retro viral medication for HIV & AIDS .
Abatarapfuye kuko hari benshi barapfuye kuko iriya miti ije vuba kuko hari benshi baducitse . ||| There are many who died because the medication just started coming in recently , they are many who passed away .
Ariko iramira n' abasigaye bakiriho umushinga wa sidipi duterwamo inkunga urebye na madamu wa perezida wa repuburika muri pakifa . ||| The medicine helps those who are still alive , the CDP project that supports us and the first lady through PACFA .
Rwose ndamushima cyane kuko kubera bagenzi be rero uwo muntu abona imiti hakaba ubwo ayibonye adafite icyo arya . ||| I am very grateful , so a widow can get the medicine and sometimes not have anything to eat .
Nayo ikamuzonga kubonera ikintu umuntu arya buri munsi n' ibintu bikomeye kuko urabona turi abapfakazi bagenzi babo . ||| And it can really affect her because the medication is strong , to get food everyday is not easy because you can see that we are widows like them .
Nta kazi dufite bamwe na bamwe bagafite nabo bafite izindi charges mungo zabo ariko turafashanya turahumurizanya . ||| We do n't have work and those who do sometimes have other responsibilities in their home , but we try to help and confort each other .
Icyo dukora nubuvugizi urumva mubyukuri benshi babaho bihebye ariko noneho avega ikintu ikora nubujyanama guhumurizanya kwegeranya . ||| What we mainly do is speak out because most people live in despair , so avega advises , conforts and brings us together .
Ni nayo objectif y' umuryango wacu kwegerana , guhumurizanya , guhozanya umuntu ukamwumvishako niba ababaye ejo ashobora guhumurizwa niba arwaye ejo ashobora koroherwa . ||| That is our main objective of our association , to bring us together , confort each other , convincing someone that if they are in pain tomorrow they might be conforted , if they are sick tomorrow they can get better .
Sida yo nikimungu kiba mu mubiri ariko bimaze kugaragarako itakinica kuwabashije kubona iyo miti . ||| HIV & AIDS is bad disease in the body but its clear now that it does not even kill when one gets those medication .
Icyo rero dukora ngewe ibyiringiro mbaha nuko kubabara atariko gupfa ariko nbuvugizi na leta kandi ubwayo undi twebwe icyo tuba twifuza nuko aba bantu batarekurwa . ||| So what we do is tell them the fact that they are in pain does n't mean that they die , and we speak up for them to the government , our desire is that these people are not given up on or forgotten .
Aba bantu bataha aba bantu bahabwa imbabazi mbese usanga biduhungabanya kuko usanga basa naho aribo bitaweho . ||| These people who are sent home and forgiven really traumatizes us because it seems as though they are the ones who are cared for .
Twebwe ugasanga ubuvugizi butuvugira yego burahari ariko ugasanga nta mbaraga ubona bushyirwamo kugirango ibibazo birangire yego ntawe uzagarura abantu . ||| But with us it seems as though those who advocate for us do not have strength or there is no emphasis so that the problems are solved , of course nobody can bring back the people who died .
Ariko ibintu biragaruka inzu iraboneka icyo kurya kiraboneka umwambaro uraboneka imiti iraboneka . ||| But things can be got back , a house , food , clothes , medicine .
Mu bake rero bahari ndibazako wenda bafashe abapfakazi cyangwa abacitse ku icumu muri rusange ntabwo ari benshi cyane kuburyo bananirwa kugira icyo bakorerwa . ||| So among the few that are alive I think if they get the widows or survivors in general , they are not so many so that they can n't do something for them .
Ngo dufashwe dufashwe ikarangira . ||| If they help us it can be over .
Ariko tumaze imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide irangiye aha ntawavuga ko uko abantu bari bameze jenocide ikirangira ariko bakimeze . ||| But it has been thirteen years after the genocide , can we say that people are still the same way they were when the genocide had just ended ?
Nyuma y' imyaka cumi nitatu ese mwebwe iyo murebye uko byari bimeze jenocide ikirangira mukongera mukareba uko bimeze nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu . ||| Thirteen years later , if you compare the way things are now and the way they were immediately after the genocide .
Mubona nibura hari ikintu cyabayeho cyo kuba abantu baragiye bava mu gihirahiro kugeza ubu umuntu yavuga ngo ubuzima burimo buragaruka . ||| Do you think that atleast people are moving from the state of turmoil and life is being restored ?
Nukuri wenda uretseko ntawarangiriza ibibazo rimwe cyangwa wenda niba tubonye abantu ijana ngo tuvuge ngo abantu barashize ariko ibintu byarahindutse none se iyo ubona abana b' imfubyi barize bakaba bararangije . ||| It 's just that no one can solve all the problems at once , or if we see a hundred people go on to say that everyone died but things have really changed a good example is the orphans that went to school and now have completed their studies it is evidence .
Bakaba bari muri universte abandi bararangije hari umwana wavuye mu mwobo aziko aziga . ||| And now they are in university and some have finished , is their a child who came out of a pit thinking that he was going to study .
Abapfakazi bamwe niba barabashije kubona aho begeka umusaya ubwo uwo muntu yavugako ntacyakozwe . ||| The widows did n't have a place to stay , can that person say that nothing was done .
Biba ari bikeya ariko wenda mu mikoro make ariko ntago narahira ngo nsembe ngo ntacyo twakorewe . ||| It 's not enough may be because of limited means but I can n't say that they did n't help us .
Cyarakozwe kuko niba umwana yararokotse ari muri secondaire ubu akaba ari muri univeriste ejo azabeshaho abandi . ||| Things have changed for example if a child survived the genocide when he was in secondary and now he is in university , he 'll also help others .
Nabataravayo kandi natwe tuzakomeza dufatanye tuvuge tuvuge icyangombwa nukuvuga kandi nanone abakiri inyuma ntago navuga ngo wenda nukubirengagiza . ||| And we will continue to stand together and talk , I do n't want us to forget those who are behind us .
N' abanyarwanda bose muri rusange ntabwo bameze neza nkantswe nuwakuwe mutwe burundu . ||| Generally rwandans are not doing great now imagine those who were taken out of their own .
Ariko buhoro buhoro ngewe mbona hari icyahindutse gusa haracyarimo abameze nabi cyane binambabaza iyo numvise bavuga ngo batanga inkunga y' ingoboka ya farg . ||| But slowly I think something has changed but there 's still a long way to go . They problem is that there are some people who are doing very badly and it huts me when I hear that they support FARG .
Ugasanga baravuga ngo mu mezi atatu ibihumbi icumi hari nutabirya mu mezi icumi icyo kintu rero kirambabaza icyo cyumvise hari nubwo numva ari agashinyaguro . ||| They say that in three months there are people who do not even it ten thousands francs , I am hurt whenever I hear this , sometimes I think thats its mocking us .
Bakwiye kwiga uburyo bakareba ukuntu umuntu afashwa koko bihoraho bidahora byirukanka bajya gusaba . ||| They should look for a way that a person should be supported continually so that they do n't keep going to ask for help .
Hari ikintu nendaga kubabaza kijyanye n' ibintu byo kwibuka abantu bacu bagiye bamburwa agaciro muri jenocide . ||| I wanted to ask you something in line with rememebering our loved ones that were degraded and humiliated in the genocide .
Babajugunya hirya no hino nyuma ya jenocide habayeho kugenda umuntu ashakisha ..... noneho bagashyingurwa noneho nagirango mutubwire mwumva abantu bacu bashyingurwa gute ? ||| They were thrown in different places after the genocide , someone has to go searching ... and then they are buried , so I wanted to ask you how do you think our people should be buried ?
Abantu bacu bagiye kubibuka kwiza icyambere nukumenya aho bajugunywe tukabashyingura tukabavana mu myobo . ||| The first and best way to honor our people is to know where they were thrown and we bury them taking them out of the holes .
Tukabavana mu misarane tukavuga tuti abantu bo muri aka karere bashyinguye aha tukikora tukajyayo tukahabibukira ariko noneho kwibuka kwiza nukwibuka babantu basizwe na babandi ntibajye kwibuka umugabo w' umuntu . ||| To take them out of pit latrines , to be able to say that teh people in this district are going to be honored and buried and all of us get ready and go there remember and honor them . But rememeber well is to remember well is to remember the ones that remained behind . Do n't go to remember a man
Umupfakazi we akiraraguza munzu zabamwiciye umupfakazi acyambaye incocero kandi yari akwiye kwambikwa nuwo mugabo ntabwo rero twajya tuvuga ngo tugiye kwibuka uwo mugabo . ||| When his widow stays in the house of those who killed him , when she is wearing rugs when her husband would have dressed her up well , we can n't say that we are going te remeber that man .
Tutibuka abasizwe nuwo muntu ngo abana babe bakirira batibuka ubasura ubagenderera ngo abigishe ngo mwa bana mwe nimuhumure ejo muzaba muri abagabo cyangwa abagore beza . ||| Without remembering those he left behind , for the kids to be crying and no one visits them to confort them and teach them that tomorrow they will be men and women .
Ngo tubakangurire kwitwara neza no kugira imico myiza nkiyo ababyeyi babo bari kuba babaha tujye ku ma sites memoriaux ariko twibuke na babantu basize na babandi . ||| We teach them good manners just like their parents would have done and then go the memorial sites and remember all the people who passed away .
Ubundi hari ukuntu njye numvaga ibintu numvaga twakabaye twibuka abantu bacu tukabashyingura neza tugahora tunabibuka . ||| Personally there is a way I feel that we should remember our people and bury them in such a way that we would always remember them .
Ariko ibyo bintu byombi bikajya bigerageza kujyana nkuko wari ubivuze kuri abo bantu basigaye nta kuntu umuntu yasigara muri ibyo bibazo byo kubura aho aba n' inzara . ||| But both things work together just like you have said , about the survivors . There is no way that someone can remain in that kind of trouble without knowing where to live and starving .
Ngo buri gihe tujye twibuka kuko ikintu nshaka kubivugira aho kugirango nze kubasaba ko mwagira ikintu mubivugaho . ||| So that we may always rememebr them , I want that you will make your comment and say what you think .
Ngirango nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide irangiye ngirango ni mike cyane ariko iyo witegereje uburyo inzibutso zo mu rwanda zifashwe . ||| I think that after thirteen years that the genocide has ended its not a lot of years , but when you look at the way the memorial sites are maintained .
Ubona ko hatabaye ikintu cyo guhindura uburyo zifashwemo ubona ko hatabaye ikintu cyo guhindura uburyo zifashwemo ubunako nka nyuma y' imyaka makumyabiri zishobora kuba zarangiritse muburyo bugaragara . ||| It is evident that they are not well taken care of and nothing is done about it , clearly if nothing is changed about the way they are managed then after twenty years they will be in a visibly bad condition .
Noneho ahangaha nkaba nshaka kugirango mvuge ngo kwibuka nibyabande nibyabacitse ku icumu nibyabaturanyi bacu se bo mubindi bihugu ? ||| So here I want to ask , remembering is for who ? Is it for the survivors , is for our neighbouring countries ?
Kuko kenshi abantu bagira ikintu cyo kwibuka ari uko ukwezi kwa kane kwageze ntabwo harimo akantu ko gushishikara izo site memorial zikaba zakorerwa . ||| Because many times people remember in april , there is no initiative so that memorial sites are always mIntined and in good condition .
Zigahora zitaweho mukeza igihe runaka sinzi niba mwebwe icyo kintu icyo mwabivugaho ? ||| So that there ar ealways taken care of no matter what , I do n't know what you would comment about it ?
Nukuri usanga twibuka mu kwa kane gusa wagirango ubundi tuba twaribagiwe aho bagiye tukabibuka mu kwa kane gusa . ||| It 's true that we only remember in april , you would think that at other times we forget where they went and only remember thrm in april .
Wagirango tuba twaribagiwe aho bagiye tukavuga tuti nzajya gusura abantu bange mu kwezi kwa kane . ||| You would think that we forget where they went and say , I will go visit my people in april .
Ariko uwawe umuhozaho umutima ugahora ushaka kureba aho ari naho yiriwe hariya hantu rero munzibutso arizo mubyaro ari nizi zikomeye . ||| But your loved one is always on your mind and heart and you always want to know where they spent the day and where they are but those memorials in the provinces and even the strong ones here .
Ahubwo ngewe imyaka makumyabiri uvuze ndabona ari myinshi kuko hari naho ubona zatantiye no kononekara . ||| You said twenty years but I think twenty is a lot of time because they are some that are already getting spoiled .
Hari aharidutse hari ahari ibigunda usanga baragiramo amatungo ntago rero kwibuka ariby' abacitse ku icumu nta nubwo ari ibya leta kuko leta ni abaturage . ||| Some places are crumbling , in other places there are bushes where animals are taken to eat grass , remebering is not for the genocide survivors only , its not even just for the government , because the government is people .
Niby' abanyarwanda bose kwibuka simbona rero impamvu umuntu aturanye na site njya ngira urugero rwa hariya ikanombe . ||| It 's for all rwandans to remember , I do n't see how some one who is neighbours with a memorial , I always take an example of Kanombe .
Kuri kaburimbo bigeze kuhashyira cloture y' ibyuma ariko barayibye bayimazeho umuntu ujya kwiba kuri site memorial abagiye gukoresha iki ibyo bintu ? ||| At the main road they had put there a metallic fence but they stole them and finished them off , I do n't understand how some one steals from a memorial site , what do you do with those thinks ?
Ukibaza uti uru nurugo rwaba bantu bantu batakireba ku isi ariko n' urugo rwabo . ||| It is the home of those people , they may not be here on earth but it is there home .
Ngewe rero nkabona abantu bakagombye kubishyira mu nshingano zabo noneho tukagira n' amahirwe haje inzego zo hasi umudugudu . ||| I personally think that people should make it their purpose and we are also lucky that now we have lower levels of government the umudugudu @/@ village .
Imidugudu ukareba site ziri iwabo bakareba bakazitaho bakareba niba ari ahaharurwa hagaharurwa ikigomba gukorwa cyose kigakorwa bakabishyira muri gahunda . ||| It can watch over the memorial sites in their village and see if there 's any work needed to be done , if grass needs to be cut they make sure its cut and if there 's anything else they plan for it and follow it up .
Leta kandi ni abaturage leta si ministeri si ku karere leta ni ngewe nawe nundi uri aho ngaho twese tugafatanya niko mbyumva . ||| The government is the citizens , its not a ministry or the district , it is me , you and anybody else who is available and we all work together , that 's my opinion .
Kugirango wenda tugana k' umusozo nubwo habayeho jenocide ariko ntabwo tuzayibagirwa . ||| As we are winding up , even though the genocide took place , we can n't forget about it .
Kandi nta nubwo twumva twakwifuzako yakongera kubaho hagati aha rero nagirango nsabe ese mwumva dukurikije ibihe twanyuzemo nibyo twabonye twumva twifuzako bitazongera . ||| And we do n't wish for it to happen again , so I would like to ask you , according to the hard times we went through and saw we do n't want it to happen again .
Wumva waraga abana bazavuka ejo hazaza uko b' u rwanda rwejo batigeze baba muri ibi bintu . ||| What heritage would you like to give to the rwandan children who did n't go throught these things ?
Wabaraga kuzabaraga mu rwanda rwaba rumeze rute ugereranije nuru twabayemo ? ||| What kind of rwanda would you like to give to them as a heritage compared to the one you lived in ?
Mubyukuri ahubwo mbona umurage waratangiye gukorwa nuko haba harimo za kidobya iyo ntekereje ko nta mwana ugihagurutswa mu ijuri kubera ubwoko bwe . ||| I think that the new heritage has started already , there are still problems but I am really glad that no child is asked to stand up in class because of their ethnicity .
Uko bidakorwa mu ishuri byakagombye no kudakorwa mu ngo z' abantu kuko burya imico mibi yigishirizwa munzu . ||| The way it 's not being done in schools it should also be the same in people 's homes because all the ad influence takes place at home behind closed dooors .
Ku ishyiga niko bakunda kubivuga abaturage ababyeyi nitwe turaga abana bacu ibyiza cyangwa ibibi . ||| On the cooking stove that 's how they always say , we parents are the ones that offer as a heritage good or bad things to our children .
Mwarimu ahabwa inshingano ahabwa ibyo yigisha ariko ntawe ujya gu controrwa ariko ntawe ujya gukontrola urugo rw' umuntu . ||| The teacher is given responsibilities and a syllabus to follow but no one controls someone 's home .
Ariko rwose mbona ababyeyi mbona dukwiye kwigisha abana gukundana urubyiruko rugasabana ubona ikintu cy' ubusabane bagenda bakora . ||| So I believe that we parents should teach our children to love each other , the youth needs to fellowship and be together .
Ubundi politike yacu ninziza leta y' ubumwe ninziza kuko irashaka ko abantu bose babana ariko iwacu munzu . ||| Our government 's policy is good ; the peace government wants us all to live at peace with each other but our homes .
Niho habi kandi ntawe uzahacontrola ngo amenye ngo barigisha iki ariko buhoro buhoro urabona jenocide bayigishije imyaka mirongo ine ubu tumaze imyaka cumi n' itatu twigisha kubana mu mahoro . ||| Are the ones with a problem and nobody will control and know what is being taught . The genocide was slowly taught for forty years but we have just spent thirteen years teaching to live at peace .
Tugize amahoro bigakomeza abana bacu bazabana mu mahoro bakabana mu rwanda rutarimo umwiryane rutarimo nubwoko . ||| If we continue to live in peace , our children would live together in peaceful Rwanda with no turmoil and ethnicity .
Ariko harandutse ko abakuru aritwe tubanza kubirandurwamo bwa mbere byibanze ngewe nkifuzako leta yashyiraho umwete yanga igisa n' ijambo ribi ryose riganisha kuri jenocide . ||| But it starts with us the old and mature ones , we need to uproot it , I would like the government to emphasize refusing and condemning any word that leads to the genocide .
Urikoze akarihanirwa kumugaragaro ndetse akarusha uwafashe umuhoro umuhoro burya ufatwa nuwabanje kuvuga nuko njye mbyumva abana bacu ntawe mvanguye baragwa kubona amahoro . ||| And whoever uses it should be punished publically even more than the one that actually used a machete , because a machete is used by someone who first talked about it . Personally I would like our children without differentiating to all have a heritage of peace .
Sinzi niba hari icyo wakongeraho kuri iki kiganiro twari tugiranye wenda dusoza . ||| I do n't know if there 's anything you would like to add on as we are concluding our talk ?
Nta kindi uretse gushimira ko mwatekereje kuza kumbaza kandi ibi bintu bikajya niba nawe wagira icyo umbwira niba wumvise bifatika . ||| There 's nothing except to thank you because you thought of me and came to interview me , and for these things to happen , you can also tell me if you think that the things I said make sense .
Byaba bidafatika ibidafatika ukabikuramo ibifite icyo bimaze ukabirekeramo . ||| If they make sense then you can keep them and if they do n't then you remove them .
Bikazaba ikitegererezo cy' abandi murakoze . ||| They can be somebody else 's opinion , thank you .
