Muri octobre 1990 colonel Rwagafirita wari menbre wa commite centrale ya MRND akaba na chef d' etat major adjoint wa gendarmerie , buri gihe yavugaga ko abatutsi bari mu Rwanda bose bagomba gupfa kuko ari abanzi b' igihugu bari hamwe n' inyeznzi . ||| In October 1990 , colonel Rwagafirita who was a member of MRND central committee and gendarmerie deputy chief staff always said that all Tutsis living in Rwanda had to be killed because they were the enemies of the country and accomplices of Inyenzi .
Kuribo abatutsi bose bagomabaga gufatwa bakicwa mu gihe cya vuba nta rubanza ibyo yarabivugaga buri gihe kandi byaragagaye ko yabibwiraga n' abafaransa avuga ko abatutsi ari bake ko bazabica , ibyo yabibwiye muri rapport ya commission parlementaire generale jean Valle W' umufaransa wayoboraga commission militaire y' abafaransa . ||| According to them , all Tutsis had to be arrested and killed in the shortest future without any trial .

Muri rapport ya commission parlementaire ambasaderi wari mu Rwanda yavuze ko ibyo bintu colonel Serubuga yabimubwiye , nkuko rero bigaragara ari colonel Serubuga , ari na colonel Rwagafirita bategekaga icyo gihe etat major y' arme na etat major ya gendarmerie bari bayibwiye abafaransa ko abatutsi bazicwa . ||| It is clearly stated in the parliamentary commission report that the then ambassador to Rwanda said that he had been told those words by colonel Serubuga .

Icyatumye abantu badapfa 1990 ngo abantu barimburwe nkuko byari byateguwe amahanga za amabassade zari ziri hano mu Rwanda zatangiye gushyira pression kuri president Habyarimana ngo afungure abantu bose kuko berekanye yuko yari yabafatiye ubusa . ||| The reason why people were not exterminated in 1990 as it had been planned is that other countries and embassies put pressure on Habyarimana and obliged him to release people showing that they were innocent .
Bagiye kuri brigade ya Gikondo basanga ziriya mbunda na za emmetteur recepteur z' amaradio ari ibintu by' inkinamico yakinnye byo kubeshyera abatutsi . ||| When they went to Gikondo police station , they realized that the guns , transmitting and receiving sets were just a story invented to put fake accusations on Tutsis .

On April 7th 1994 , RPF Inkotanyi decided to stop the genocide . On 4th RPF Inkotanyi stopped Rwanda 's genocide , they stopped the genocide all over Rwanda .
Methode bakoresheje ; methodes na strategies bakoresheje kugirango barimbure abatutsi , hari ugukora amalisti y' abatutsi bagombaga kwicwa , kuko ibyo mukunda guhura nabyo ibyo byose ngiye kubibabwira nicyo cyanzanye hano . ||| Strategies used to exterminate Tutsis include blacklisting them in order to kill them . Here is the problem you usually encounter probably . I am going to tell you all of that because I have come here for that .
Gukora amalisti y' abatutsi no guhimba ibinyoma ngo abtutsi bicwe n' abahutu , kwemera gutangaza amategeko icumi y' abahutu kugirango banjye abatutsi kandi batangire kwica abatutsi , kwerekana kwereka abhutu mu nzego zose ko umututsi uri mu Rwanda no hanze y' urwanda aho yahungiye ari umwanzi ugomba gupfa , gushyiraho sytem yo gushakisha umututsi ngo atabacika bashyira za bariyeri mu mayira yose ari muri cellule mu Rwanda no gusaka mu ngo no mu yandi mazu bashakisha aho umututsi yihishe ngo bamwice . ||| Blacklisting Tutsis and bringing fake accusations against them so that they get killed by hutus , publication of ten commandments of Hutus so to make the latter hate and then kill Tutsis , convincing Hutus at all levels that any tutsi living in Rwanda or in exile is an enemy that needs killing , setting barriers in all paths even in cells all over Rwanda so to hunt every tutsi and prevent him from escaping , searching houses in order to find where Tutsis might be hiding so kill them ,
Gutanga imbunda mu baturage muri za komini zose zo mu Rwanda izo mbunda zigamije kurimbura abatutsi , gushyiraho za milices mrnd interahamwe , na cdr impuzamugambi zo kurimbura abatutsi kuri za bariyeri naho bihishe , kwigisha interahamwe n' impuzamugambi gutera ibigo byabihaye Imana za kiriziya.amasengero amashuri , abatutsi bahunze bihishemo ngo babice bose mu gihe gito . ||| Giving out guns in the population of all communes all over Rwanda which guns were to be used in order to exterminate Tutsis , establishing militias Interahamwe of MRND and Impuzamugambi of CDR intended to kill Tutsis on the barriers and where they might be hiding , training Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi in order to invade houses of religious people of the Catholic Church , churches and schools where Tutsis might have gone for escape so kill them in a very short time .
Gukangurira abahutu ko bari hejuru y' abatutsi , ko kwica abatutsi , gufata abatutsikazi ku ngufu , gutwika amazu yabo , gutwara imitungo yabo , kwangiza imitungo yabo ntawe ubihanirwa muri leta y' urwanda , gukora amalisti y' abatutsi byatangiye ari methode yakoreshejwe guturuka mu 1961,1973 , iyo methode ikoreshejwe na mdr parmehutu . ||| Convincing hutus that they are above Tutsis and that killing the latter , raping tutsi women , burning their houses , seizing their property shall not be punished in Rwanda . Blacklisting Tutsis was a strategy that started being used since 1961 and 1973 by MDR PARMEHUTU .
munyakazi Iyo methode yakoreshejwe na none na mrnd yari iyobowe habyarimana juvenal ku itariki ya 01.101990 presidence ya repuburika yari ifite service de l' enseignement yari ifite ayo malisti y' abatutsi bagombaga guhita bafatwa bakicwa kuko inyenzi zari zateye urwanda . ||| The method was also used by MRND chaired by Habyarimana Juvenal on October 1st 1990 . The president 's office had an intelligence department that kept the lists of Tutsis to be caught and killed at once because Inyenzi had invaded Rwanda .
munyakazi Kubeshyera abatutsi no guhimba ibinyoma ngo abatutsi bicwe n' abahutu , ngirango mu byo nababwiye nababwiye ukuntu ku itariki ya mbere .10.1990 leta y' urwanda na none a gouvernement y' urwanda bakoresheje iriya methode na strategies kugirango bahimbire abatutsi ibinyoma , ngiye kongera kubisubiramo kuko ibyo binyoma byarakomeje muri kiriya gihe cy' imyaka ine . ||| I think I have already told you that on October 1st 1990 , the government of Rwanda used the strategy of charging Tutsis of fake accusations in order to abuse their reputation . I will repeat it because the very accusations took four years .
Babeshyeye abatutsi ko ari ibyitso by' inyenzi bigomba gupfa nk' umwanzi bafite imbunda n' amasasu , bafite stock z' imbunda n' amasasu , bafite za radion emetteur recepteur , leta y' urwanda na gouvernement y' urwanda nkuko nabiberetse bahimbye ikinamico ko inyenzi zavuye Uganda zateye urwanda ibypo ngibyo nabibasobanuriye ko bemeye ko amategeko icumi y' abahutu yatangazwa akigishwa abaturage . ||| Tutsis were wrongfully accused of being accomplices of Inyenzi to be killed like any other enemy , of keeping guns and bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets . as I have already showed above , the government of Rwanda invented a story whereby Inyenzi had invaded . I have already explained that the government accepted the publication and teaching of the ten commandments of hutus to the population .
Mwari murangije ? ||| are you through ?
Oya nuko barimo barasakuza mwababwira bagaceceka ||| No , people are making noise . You may tell them to keep quiet !
Twumvikane , twumvikane mumenye ko twasomye amabwiriza tugenderaho , mureke abanze arangize . ||| Please hold on ! Hold on please ! Remember the instructions we have already read . Let him finish .
Ku itariki ya makumyabiri na rimwe , y' ukwezi kwa cyenda 1992 , chef d' etat major nsabimana yabwiye abasirikare bose bo muri arme rwandaise ko umututsi uri mu Rwanda no hanze y' urwanda ari umwanzi . ||| On September 21st 1992 , chief staff Nsabimaana told soldiers in the army that every tutsi living in Rwanda was an enemy .
Iyo ideologie yari isanzweho kuva mu 1963 , uretse ko etat major yayishyize mu nyandiko , amashyaka mrnd , cdr , mdr pawer pl pawer n' amalisti yabo bigishije abayoboke babo ko umututsi uri mu Rwanda no hanze yarwo ari umwanzi ugomba gupfa , gushyiraho system no gushakisha umwanzi ngo atabacika bashyiraho za bariyeri mu mayira yose ari mu macellule mu Rwanda no gusaka mungo , no mu bihuru bashakisha aho umututsi yishishe ngo bamwice . ||| This ideology had already existed since 1963 and had just been put into writing by the army staff . Political parties such as MRND , CDR , MDR Power , and PL Power with their lists had convinced their members that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed . In order to locate the enemy and prevent him from escaping , barriers were set in all paths in cells of Rwanda . Houses and bushes were also searched to se where a tutsi might be hiding and kill him .
Iyo methode bayikoresheje kuva kuva ku itariki ya gatandatu mu kwezi kwa kane 1994 kugeza 04.07.1994 iyo methode rero yatumye hapfa abatutsi benshi mu Rwanda . ||| This method was used since April 6th 1994 till July 4th 1994 and cost many lives of Tutsis in Rwanda
Kuko bategetsi abaturage bo muri cellule kujya kuri izo bariyeri , gukora amarondo mu ijoro ryose bashakisha umututsi ngo bamwice , iyo methode bayise auto defense et commune bajijisha kugirango amahanga atabamagana ariko iyo methode yari ikabije kurimbura abatutsi mu Rwanda kubera yuko bari bavuze ko umututsi ari umwanzi ugomba gupfa . ||| Because the population in cells was ordered to settle on the barriers , be on patrol all nights looking for a Tutsi in order to kill him . This method was called self and common defense . This was just fancying other countries so that they might not denounce it but the method was actually intended to exterminating Tutsis in Rwanda since it had been put that a Tutsi is an enemy to be killed .
Imbunda nazo zaratanzwe kuva ku itariki ya mbere mu kwezi kwa cumi 1990 zigamije kurimbura abatutsi , za milices zashyizweho za MRND na CDR kandi byari binyuranyije n' amategeko yo mu Rwanda , bigishije interahamwe n' impuzamugambi guturuka 1959 abatutsi bahungiraga mu bigo by' abihayimana kiriziya , gatorika amasengero , amashuri bararokokaga . ||| Guns had also been given out since October 1st 1990 . The guns intended to exterminate Tutsis . The establishment of MRND and CDR militias was illegal as far as Rwandan law was concerned . Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi were also trained . From 1959 , Tutsis had been escaping to houses of religious people , churches and schools of the Catholic church and could survive
Kuko abaturage batinyag kwica abatutsi muri ibyo bigo , MRND , CDR , bigishije interahamwe n' impuzamugambi kujya mu bigo by' abihayimana za kiriziya gatorika mu masengero mu mashuri bakica mu gihe gito abatutsi bose barimo . ||| Because the population feared to kill Tutsis in those houses . MRND and CDR trained Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi to attack those houses , churches and schools of the catholic Church and kill in very short time the Tutsis in .
Iyo methode na strategie bayikoze kugeza ku itariki ya kane z' ukwa karindwi 1994 , niyo mpamvu abantu bahungiye muri ibyo bigo bahuye n' ibitero byinshi by ; interahamwe zari zifite umugambi wo kubarimbura kandi interahamwe zakiriye zicaga abtutsi benshi muri biriya bigo . ||| This method was used till July 4th . That is the reason why people who escaped there were attacked many times . Interahamwe were set to exterminate them and killed many Tutsis in those houses , churches and schools .
Guturuka mu 1959 leta y' urwanda na za gouvernement bashyizeho system yo gukoresha abahutu benshi mu mugambi wo kwica abatutsi bagatwara ibintu byabo ntihaire umuntu uhanwa na leta na za gouverenement ||| Since 1959 , the governments of Rwanda had been using a big number of Hutus to kill Tutsis whom Hutus seized the property of the latter without any prosecution by the government .
Kubyerekeye ibyo nabonye kuri Goma kuko nambuka nye na far icyo gihe nuko nimbivuga wenda abantu baravuga ngo si ngombwa . ||| Now here is what I saw at Goma when I was exiling with FAR People though people may say that is not necessary , I am afraid ...
Mu kwezi kwa gatandatu no mu kwezi kwa kane 1994 kugeza ku itariki ya gatatu y' ukwezi kwa karindwi 1994 , nuko muri etat major no muri gendarmerie harimo aba officiers bakurikira icyo gihe mu Rwanda uwitwa Bizimana ntago yari ahari ariko icyo gihe dierecteur de cabinet yari Bagosora niwe wari uhari muri ministere . ||| April , June 1994 till July 3rd 1994 , officers who were in the army and gendarmerie staff command are the following @: in the time Bizimana was not in Rwanda .

Political parties such as MRND , CDR , MDR Power , PL Power and governmental administration kept conspiring in the capital Kigali . As far as the killings of Tutsis from October 1st 1990 to December 31st 1994 are concerned , the reaction was that all reports showed that those killings were carried out by the government of Rwanda together with FAR , authorities at all levels as well as a big number of the population .

In my duties , I drew a report to the gendarmerie chief staff and the minister of defense saying that I had not caught a single Tutsi with model IV identity card so far said to be held by all Tutsis in Rwanda , what was just an invented story .
Icya kabiri ; nakoze rapport ko nta spor z' indangamuntu moden ya kane twasanze muri imprimerie ya Sisi Evaliste ku kicukiro no ku bandi batutsi bari bararezwe na service centrale de renseignement ya presidence ko bazifite barimo kuziha abatutsi kugirango inyenzi nizibabona zibatandukanye n' abahutu . munyakazi munyakazi Nakoze rapport ko nta mbunda n' amasasu byabonetse byasanganywe umututsi mu buryo butemewe n' amategeko kuko hari abatutsi bari bafite imbunda bari barahawe na leta y' urwanda , ||| The second thing I did is that I drew a report saying that we found no spool neither in Sisi Evariste 's printing house at Kicukiro nor in other Tutsis accused of keeping them and giving them out in Tutsis so that Inyenzi might distinguish them from Hutus . Those accusations had been brought by the central intelligence department of the president 's office . munyakazi Munyakazi I drew a report saying that there was no gun found , illegally possessed by a single tutsi because there were Tutsis who possessed guns that they had been given by the government
Ko nta stock z' imbunda , n' amasasu byasanganywe abatutsi ko nta radio n' imwe yasanganywe umututsi , nagiye no kuri brigade ya gikondo nasanze imbunda berekanye ko ziri kuri brigade ya gikondo , izo mbunda zari zishaje zirimo amavuta zari zibitswe mu du stock zibitse mu mangazini y' arme rwandaise twabajije abajandarume bari baraho batubwira ko zazanywe n' abasirikare ba gd yayoborwaga na lieutenant colonel Nsengiyumva icyo gihe twahahuriye n' abakozi bamwe bo muri z' ambassade bari baje kureba izo mbunda . ||| I reported that no gun stores , bullets , transmitting and receiving sets were found in Tutsis ' houses . I also went to Gikondo police station . I found out that the guns showed to be taken from Tutsis were worn and greased . They were kept in small stores of the Rwandan army . We asked gendarmes who were around . They told us that the guns had been brought by GD soldiers commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel Nsengiyumva . We met there some agents from embassies who had come to see the guns
Twasanze na none amaradio ari igikondo bavugaga yuko bafatanye inyenzi nayo yari ashaje atagikora ahubwo , bavuga yuko abasirikare twasanze igikondo batubwiye yuko ayo maradio yazanywe n' abasirikare bo kwa gd yari iyobowe na lieutenant colonel Nsengiyumva , izo rapport nazihaye chef d' etat major wa gendarmerie nziha na ministiri w' ingabo , ninazo rapport nahaye procuraire generale Lorge . ||| We also found out that the transmitters and receivers said to be taken from Inyenzi were too worn and could not work .

I told you that it was on 4th and 6th . That is the time when we met agents from embassies , which started putting pressure on Habyarimana saying he was bringing fake accusations against Tutsis in order to have the alibi to kill them .

The mobile group was a unity of the national gendarmerie in charge of protecting Radio Rwanda , Rwanda television , Rwandatel , the National bank , and MINADEF .
Nongere nsubiremo , groupe mobile nari nshinzwe kuyobora , nari nshinzwe kurinda , radio Rwanda , television Rwanda , rwandatel , banque natioanale , minadef , naho commanda wa camp muhima nari nshinzwe kurinda ikigo cya camp muhima . ||| I say it once again @: as the mobile group commander , my duty was to protect Radio Rwanda , Rwanda television , Rwandatel , the National bank , and MINADEF .

Ibyo nakoze nka commanda wa groupe mobile nahaye amategeko abagendarme bari kuri position ya ministere y' ingabo , banque nationale , na rwandatel kurinda abaturage , abihay' Imana , bari muri cathedrale st Michel . ||| Do I answer your question about what I did ? What I did as the mobile group commander is to give the order to gendarmes to protect Radio Rwanda , Rwanda television , Rwandatel , the National bank , and MINADEF as well as the population and religious people who were in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral .

Now we want to know ; what was your role in all that ? You have absolutely said you did not do anything wrong . Would you explain to us ?

The gendarmes under my command succeeded to protect all the people who escaped to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . I protected religious people and all others who came there . Displaced people who were at Gisimba 's were taken from Nyamirambo to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral because it was known that it was protected by gendarmes under the command of lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi .

You are allowed neither to laugh at him nor to acclaim what he says be it false or true . You shall be given the floor when need is !
Muri cathedrale st michel rero , nubwo ndimo kumva abantu baseka muri cathedrale st michel izo mfubyi n' abantu bakuru bari bavuye inyamirambo narabarinze kugeza ku itariki ya kane z' ukwezi kwa karindwi abajandarume barahunga , bamaze guhunga ntawe bahohoteye na gisimba ubwe yabyemeza . ||| in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral ... you know ... though I see people laughing at me ! I protected all those orphans and old people from Nyamirambo till July 4th when gendarmes exiled . They had not hurt anyone though . Gisimba himself can confirm that .
Na padiri Karibushi mumwandike nawe , padiri karibushi wakiriye ziriy munzi zose zo muri cathedrale st michel kuko niho hari hagati muri position zanjye na muntu abajandarume bahohoteye muri cathedrale st michel , padiri karibushi muzamutumize aze hano yabibabwira na gisimba nawe yabibabwira ko abana yari afite n' abantu bakuru nta muntu nahohoteye . ||| Note father Karibushi as well . Father Karibushi who received those displaced people in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . This was in the center of my area . No single individual was attacked by the gendarmes under my command in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . You shall invite Father Karibushi . Even Gisimba can tell you that I did not hurt any of his children and old people .
Have nkomeze noneho mvuge ibindi , nka commanda camp muhima , haje compagnie yi teritoriale ya Nyarugenge yari iruhande rwa camp Muhima aho ikorera hariya hari police , nayihaye amategeko yo kujya kurinda impunzi iyo compagnie territoriale Nyarugenge yari ira groupement Kigali , iyo compagnie territoriale yari iya compagnie Kigali ariko nayihaye amategeko , amategekonahaye capitaine Nyiribambe yo kujya kurinda abaturage bari kuri hotel mille colline , eglise st famille , cathedrale st Michel pardon centre st Paul na lyce notre dame de citeaux . ||| I now go to something else ; as the commander of Muhima military camp . At one time , Nyarugenge territory company came to settle next to Muhima military camp . It used to stay in the police 's place today . Though Nyarugenge territory company belonged to Kigali formation , I gave them orders . I ordered captain Nyiribambe to go and protect the people who were in Hotel de Mille Collines , in Sainte @-@ Famille church , in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral , I beg your pardon ! It is rather saint @-@ Paul centre and Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux .
Kuri hotel mille colline abajandarume biyo compagnie territoriale barayirinze bari hamwe na lieutenant colonel Mwangi wo muri MINUAR . ||| The gendarmes of the company protected Hotel de Milles Collines . They were with lieutenant @-@ colonel Mwangi of MINUAR .
Ku itariki ya makumyabiri na karindwi z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu , etat major d' arme yakuye abantu bari .................. yabakuyemo abari basigaye bitwa ko bagiye gushyiramo ibindi bikorwa kuko bavugaga ngo abafaransa bagiye kuza hano muri za Kigali , icyo gihe nta responsabilite iyo compagnie territoriale yari igifite kuri iriya hotel kuko yari yamaze gufatwa na etat major y' arme rwandaise . ||| On June 27th , the army staff command displaced people who were ... Those who had stayed were displaced pretending that other activities were to be established there . It was said French would come to settle in Kigali . In that time , the territory company had no responsibilities because the hotel had just been seized by Rwanda army staff command
Ku itariki ya cumi hotel mille colline yatewe inshuro nyinshi n' interamwe , kuko yari irimo abantu bitaga ngo n' ibyitso bya FPR , ariko abajandarume biyo compagnie bari kuri hotel mille collines na bajandarume ba groupe mobile bari kuri izo position nababwiye barwanyije interahamwe . ||| On the 10th , Hotel de Milles Collines was repeatedly attacked by Interahamwe militias because it sheltered people called RPF accomplices . However , the gendarmes of the company together with the mobile group who were at Hotel de Milles Collines , as I told you , fought against Interahamwe
Ku itariki ya cumin a karindwi y' ukwezi kw agatandatu 1994 , interahamwe zaje ari nyinshi cyane zishobora kwinjira muri hotel mille collines zisatura inzugi zitangira kumanura abantu ngo zijye kubica , barampamagaye , ndahurura nsanga hari imiryango ibiri n' abana babo bari bagejeje kuri reception bagiye kubica , ngirango niyo miryango nayikubwira kugirango uzabibarize . ||| On June 17th 1994 , the Interahamwe militias came in a very big number and succeeded to enter the hotel . They broke doors and started getting people down in order to kill them . I was called and I went there . I found two families that had just been taken to the reception desk to be killed . I may even tell you the families so that you may ask them yourself .
Hari umuryango wa Murindangabo Embroise , hari umuryango Habiyakare bose bari bari aho nagho babonye ko naje kubatabara . ||| There was the family of Murindangabo Embroise and one of Habiyakare . They all saw that I was coming for their help
Icyo gihe ndi kuri hotel mille collines ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi hari harimo padiri Uwimana wategekaga st Andre ahungira muri centre st paul nyuma aza kujya muri hotel mille collines , yabonye ndi kuri hotel mille collines nanatanze n' amabwiriza kugirango batabare birukane interahamwe zari zigiye kujya muri centre st paul et st famille kujya kwica abantu bari barimo . ||| When I was at Hotel de Milles Collines on 17th , there was Father Uwimana the priest of Saint @-@ André parish who had escaped to Saint @-@ Paul center but went to Hotel de Milles Collines after . He saw me at the hotel ; I even gave orders to go for help to people who were at Saint @-@ Paul and Sainte @-@ Famille and chase Interahamwe who were going there to kill them .
Padiri Uwimana yarambwiye ati ndabona ugifite umutima muntu wo gutabara abantu ndagirango ngusabe ujye muri centre st Paul gutabara abantu interahamwe zigiye kwica bari kwa padiri Vermerie bari bicaye muri za cave zo kwa musenyeri Vermerie . ||| Father Uwimana told me @: "@ I can see that you still have a human heart to help people . I want to beg you one thing ; I want you to go for help to people who are at Saint @-@ Paul center who are going to get killed by Interahamwe . They are at father Vermerie 's @"@ . They were sitting down in the caves at Bishop Vermerie 's .
Icyo gihe naragiye ndamubwira nti ntago nzi kwa padiri Vermerie arambwira ati noneho ngwino tujyaneyo njye kuhakwereka , icyo gihe twaragiye tugiye dufata nari muri kamyonneti dufata abapadir bari bahari n' ababikira bari bahari bose mbajyana muri cathedrale st Michel , muri abo bapadiri harimo padiri , Hakizimana Celestin wayoboraga centre st Paul , Mwumvaneza Anaclet haromo Galican Ndayisaba , harimo Sfi , harimo Tubane n' ababikira n' abandi bantu bari barikumwe nabatwaye muri cammionet ndi hamwe na padiri Uwimana ndabazamukana mbageza kuri cathedrale st Michel nababtwaye mu nshuro ebyiri . ||| I went to him and said that I did not know at Father Vermerie 's . He suggested going together so that he might lead me . I was in a pick @-@ up vehicle . We went to take priests and nuns who were there . I took all of them to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . Among the priests , there was Hakizimana Celestin who was in charge of Saint @-@ Paul center , Mwumvaneza Anaclet , Galican Ndayisaba , Sfi , Tubane and other people with him . I carried them in the pickup to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . I was with Father Uwimana . I did it two times
Icyo gihe nubwo nagiye mbisoma mu binyamakuru , depite Rugema Donatien inkotanyi ziter zajyanye abantu nawe ajyana nabo ageze mu nzira aravuga ngo batamwica agaruka muri centre st Paul agarutse muri centre st Paul agumana niyo groupe naje kujyamo ngiye kubatabara ahita yirukanka ajya muri eglise st famille mu mpunzi abwira impunzi zose ati jye ndarusimbutse Munyakazi lieutenant colonel atwaye abantu mu ikamyonet ajyiye kubica . ||| Surprisingly , I read in newspapers .... Meanwhile when Inkotanyi came and took people with them , MP Rugema Donatien went among the people . On the way he came back to Saint @-@ Paul lest he should get killed . He had joined the group at Saint @-@ Paul and stayed with them . When I went there for their help , he immediately ran away and went to Sainte @-@ Famille to tell displaced people who were in that he had just escaped from death @: lieutenant @-@ colonel had taken people in a pickup and was going to kill them .
Uwo munsi yari yirirwanye n' abantu bo muri centre st Paul arahunga yanga ko mutwara ajya mu kiriziya kumbeshyera ngo abo ntwaye ngiye kubica , abo bantu bariho kandi hakozwe z' enquete abo bantu bariho bose . ||| He had been with the people in saint @-@ Paul all the day , refused to be taken with others and went to bring fake accusations against me in the church saying that I was going to kill those I had taken with me . All those people are still alive . Investigations have proven that . They are all alive .
Ku itariki ya cumi n' umunani ku itariki ya cumi n' icyenda , baransabye bati ndi kuri cathedrale st Michel bansabye yuko abapadiri yuko dufata ababikira ba Vincent bariya , Abasomusiyo ababikira bari bari muri procule n' abafurere bose ngo mbajyane muri cathedrale st Michel bose babe hamwe . Bose narabatwaye mbageza muri cathedrale st Michel bose ntacyo babaye bariho nabo mwazabahamagara bakabibabwira ko nabatwaye . ||| Because I was at Saint @-@ Michel cathedral , on 18th and 19th I was asked by priests to take Saint @-@ Vincent and Assumption sisters as well as religious brothers who were in Procure and bring them to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral so that they might stay together . I took all of them to the cathedral . Nothing bad happened to them . They are all alive , invite them ; they will tell you . I did not harm them .
Kuva ku itariki noneho abajandarume nasize kuri centre st Paul no kuri eglise St famille hari akandi kazi nabahaye , nubwo abantu batakavuze tugomba kukavuga , hari impunzi mu bice bibirihari impunze za gouvernement zishyigikiye gouvernement hanze harya ku kibuga ugakomeza kuri ecole primaire ugakomeza muri joc , zatemberaga uko zishaka , hakaba n' izindi mpunzi zari zihishe muri eglise st famille no muri centre st Paul zidafite ibiryo zidafite n' amazi . ||| Meanwhile , the gendarmes I had transferred to Saint @-@ Paul center and Sainte @-@ Famille had another duty given to them . It had not been evoked but we have to evoke it for the moment . Displaced people comprised two parts @: there were displaced people who were for the government outside the church , to the primary school and to JOC . These ones could walk without any problem . There were others who were hiding in the church and Saint @-@ Paul center who could not have neither food nor water .
Padiri Hakizimana bashima cyane ko yarwnye ku mpunzi zo muri centre st Paul yangejejeho icyo kibazo naba padiri Galican , bose bari kumwe , bati Munayakazi dufite impunzi ariko twabuze uko tubona amazi twabuze uko tubina ibiryo , interahamwe turabura uko twava hariya ngo tujye kuzana ibiryo muri caritas bafite muri stock inyamirambo muri st Andre na hariya bubatse inzu yabo ikomeye cyane y' igorofa . ||| Father Hakizimana , praised for having helped a lot displaced people , together with Father Galican as well as other priests they were together , told me the problem . They said that they sheltered displaced people but did not have means to get water and food . There were Interahamwe there and they could not leave so to bring food from CARITAS stock at Nyamirambo , Saint @-@ André and ... the place where the Church built a very big house
Watubwirira abajandarume bakajya bajya kutuzanira ibiryo n' amazi kugirango tugaburire izi mpunzi ? Narabyemeye abajandarume bari bari centre st Paul egise st famille nemeye yuko bajya kuvomera impunzi , bajya kubazanira n' ibiryo nubwo ibyo bintu bitakunzwe kuvugwa ariko abapadiri bari hano barahari nabo bazabibibwirira abajandarume bari bahari babikoze ako kazi bagakoze . ||| They asked me to give them gendarmes to help them get food for displaced people . I accepted that gendarmes at saint @-@ Paul center and Sainte @-@ Famille went to fetch water for the displaced people . They even went to bring food for them . Even though these things are not often evoked the priests who were there may tell you that the gendarmes did that work .
Ikindi na none nakoze mugutabara abntu mu ibang ryacu nari mfitanye naba padiri Hakizimana twemeye ko ibyo biryo biva muri iriya stock ya st famille tukabyohereza kuri loi faycal no kuri hotel miridien biciye kuri croix rouge kuko nta biryo bari bafite , twashakaga kubivana inyamirambo tukabinyuza muri stock za caritas mu ibanga bikomeye tukabizana muri zone ya FP , niko bimeze niko byagenze . ||| Something else I did as far as helping people is concerned is running a secret operation with Father Hakizimana . In our secret operation , we were well @-@ suited that the food would be taken from Sainte @-@ Famille stock and sent to King Faycal Hospital and Hotel Méridien through Red Cross because there was no food . We wanted to secretly take the food from CARITAS stocks at Nyamirambo and bring it in the area controlled by RPF . We would proceed like that . We did it exactly that way .
Abapadiri bari hano iryo ni ibanga kuko kuko muravuga ngo twakoze iki ibiryo abantu bo muri loi faycal , bo kuri hotel miridien bariye jye lietenant colonel Munyakazi nemeye mu ibanga rikomeye kubyoherezayo kuburyo rwose n' abandi n' abayobozi banjye barabimbajije ndabihakana kuko ryari ibanga rikomeye cyane murumva ko jyewe nta mutima mubi nari mfite kuko ntashakaga ko n' abantu bicwa n' inzara . ||| Priests who present , that is the secret . You have been asking what we did . I , lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi , accepted to send in a deep secret the food eaten by people in King Faycal , in Hotel Méridien . Even my seniors asked me about that and I denied it because it was a very deep secret . You can see that I was a good @-@ hearted man ; I did not even want people to starve
Murumva murangije ? Utwemereye ko groupe mobile ya st famille na st Paul ||| Do you think you are through ? Have you said that the mobile group at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul ...
Amategeko nayahaye capitaine Ntirugiribambe ||| I ordered Captain Ntirugiribambe
N' ukuvuga ngo wari wabashyiriyeho kugirango barinde abantu bahungiraga mu kiriziya kugirango baticwa . ||| Do you mean you set them to protect people who had escaped to the church ?
Yego ||| Definitely !
Siko byari bimeze ? ||| Was n't it that way ?
Amategeko niyo nari natanze ||| I gave orders
Yeee , noneho rero tutari twagera aho nea ngirango tugitangira n' impamvu yatumye tugutumira bwa mbere wenda ubutumire bukaba butarakugezeho ||| Alright ! Before that , I want to start by the reason why we had invited you though you did not get the invitation ....
Ntabwo bwangezeho ||| I did not get it
Twagirango tumenye imikoranire yawe nkuko wabisobanuye kuris t famille imitwe ibiri , hari umutwe w' abajandarume nyine mwayoboraga hari n' umutwe w' abaturage bafite intwaro siko byari bimeze siko wabisobanuye ? Abaturage bari bafite intwaro watubwiye ko wari ufite inshingano zo kurinda abaturage none hakaba hari abaturage bafite imbunda bicaga bagenzi babo bahunga kubera ubwoko bwabo ngirango ibyo murabizi nawe wabisobanuye . ||| We want to know your relationship with ... As you explained , there were two groups at Sainte @-@ Famille . One of gendarmes of course under your command , and another of the population who were armed . Was n't it that way ? Did you explain it that way ? You had the responsibility to protect people as you said . How come that there were armed people killing others who were running away because of their ethnic group ? I think you all know that . You have also explained it .
twakubaza rero tutari twinjira neza ngo twumva neza ibyo bakuvuzeho nawe ugire icyo ubidusobanuriraho gatoya , utubwire utubwire imikoranire yawe nabo bantu bavuye ku Gisozi bahunze imirwano nabo bakaza bafite imbunda bashyiraho amabariyeri batangira abantu bahungiraga muri st famille kugirango babice , ndetse bikaba nta nicyo byanatanze abantu muri st famille barashize ubwo uragira icyo ubidusobanuriraho ku mikoranire , unatubwire icyo abajandarume mwayoboraga bari barinze aho ngaho kandi abantu barapfa buri munsi ? ||| Before we get deep into the matter , we would like to ask you about rumors about you so that you may say something about it as well . Would you say something about your relationship with armed people who had escaped from fights at Gisozi ? These people set barriers in roads and arrested people who went to Sainte @-@ Famille in order to kill them . How can you explain it given that your protection did not save lives since all people who were at Sainte @-@ Famille died ? You shall explain to us the above relationship and tell us the importance of your gendarmes considering that people died every single day .
Buriya ntago wanyumvishije jye nayoboraga groupe mobile , iyo groupe mobile nababwiye ko yarinze cathedrale st Michel uranyumva ? Noneho kuri cathedrale st Michel nakubwiye ko nta bibazo byigeze bihaba . ||| I am afraid you have not understood me well ! I told you that I commanded the mobile group . I also told you that the mobile group watched over Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . Do you get me ? I told you there was no problem at Saint @-@ Michel Cathedral .
Noneho rero nka commanda camp muhima hari compagnie territoriale ya Nyarugenege yari hariya ku muhima narababwiye nti mushyire position kuri hotel mille collines , eglise st famille centre st Paul , lyce notre dame de citeaux murinde abaturage jye ku giti cyanjye nta nterahamwe nakoranye nazo . ||| Then as the commander of Muhima military camp , I ordered the territory company that was there , to settle at Hotel de Mille Collines , Sainte @-@ Famille church , Saint @-@ Paul center , and Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux in order to protect the population . Personally I did not have any connection with the Interahamwe .
Kuki izo nterahamwe dusobanurire neza tugere ahantu twumva neza kuki bo bari bafite imbunda ? Kandi ari cyo wari ushinzwe , umutekano w' abaturage badashobora kwicwa ese abo bantu bose izo mbunda bazikuye he kandi ntago mwakoranaga ? ||| Explain it well till we really understand . Why were those Interahamwe armed ? It was among your duties to protect people so that they might not be killed . Where did those people get guns from if you were not connected with them ?
Jye nakubwiye ko abo bajandarume barindaga abantu iyo bazi amategeko abajandarume baragiye bajyayo baba barakoranye nabo uwo capitaine Ntirugiribambe yazabigusobanurira ariko jyewe ntabwo nigeze nkorana n' intehamwe zateye kuri eglise st famille cg kuri centre st Paul . ||| I told you that the gendarmes protected the population there . Whether gendarmes went there from time to time , whether they were connected with them , Captain Ntirugiribambe may explain it to you better . I ensure you that I had no connection with the Interahamwe who attacked Sainte @-@ Famille church and Saint @-@ Paul center .
Nyakubahwa uremera ko st famille na st paul haguye abantu benshi ? ||| Do you accept that many people died at saint @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul Sir ?
Hapfuye abantu ndabizi . ||| Of course ! I do know that people died there
None se munshingano mwari mwahaye abajandarume zari izo kurinda bande ? ||| So , the task you had given to your gendarmes was to protect who exactly ?
Zari izo kurinda abaturage ndabizi ||| The population , yes I know !
Abahe baturage ? ||| Which population ?
? bari barahungiye aho ngaho ||| One that had escaped there
Mu kiriziya no muri st Paul imbere ? Sibyo ? ||| In the church and at Saint @-@ Paul center ? Isn ’ it ?
Nibyo rwose ||| Yes , it is .
None se ko bapfaga buri munsi kandi bikaba bigarara na ma rapport menshi abyerekana n' abantu benshi bahahungiye wowe dusobanurire ibyo bintu neza ntago twubyumva ||| So , why were they dying every single day ? It is clear in many reports and many people who had escaped there say it . How can you really explain that ? It is not clear !
Banza unsobanurire ayo ma rapport nyamenye ibyo bandega noneho ngusobanurire uko ibyo bintu byari bimeze kuko nkuko wabivugaga ||| Tell me first what those reports are so that I may have the idea of those accusations brought against me as you are saying .
Ubundi nagirango ngusobanurire , twumvikane ntabwo ari urubanza n' ukumenya amakuru . ||| I just wanted to explain to you so to have the same understanding of things . This is not a trial . It is just information collection
Waavuze ko Atari urubanza , ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu nabonye nabonye mu binyamakuru baranditse ngo nijye wari uyoboye icyo gitero cy' interahamwe zateye kuri eglise kuris t famille , ibyo ntago bishobokaicyo gihe FPR yakoze operation yo gukura abaturage muri centre st Paul interahamwe bararakara bavuga ko bagiye gutera ibigo byose , bateye hotel mille collines , batera eglise st famille bagerageza no kujya gutera cathedrale st Michel . ||| You have just said yourself that this is not a trial ! On June 17th , I read in newspapers that I headed the Interahamwe 's attack to Sainte @-@ Famille . It is impossible @: at that time , RPF had carried out an operation and took people from Saint @-@ Paul . The Interahamwe became angry and decided to attack all institutions . They attacked Hotel de Mille Collines , Sainte @-@ Famille church and tried even to attack Saint @-@ Michel cathedral .
Jye nka commanda rero nakubwiye uko nakoze barambwiye ngo kuri hotel mille colline barangije gusatura inzugi , bagejeje abntu kuri reception , reaction nakoze ni iyihe ? Nagombaga kuva mu kigo cya Muhima nkirukira kuri hotel mille collines nahise posha icyo gitero cyo kuri hotel mille collines kandi abo abajandarume nibo birukanye izo nterahamwe zari zikuye abantu muri eglise st famille zibinjiza hagati ya st famille na procure . ||| As a commander , I already told you what I did . I was told that the doors of Hotel de Mille Collines had just been broken and that people had already been taken up to the reception desk . This was my reaction @: I quickly ran from Muhima military camp to Hotel de Mille Collines . I immediately brought the Interahamwe 's attack to heel and the very gendarmes chased the Interahamwe who were taking people from Sainte @-@ Famille church and making them enter the Procure .
Urumva ko jyewe icyo gitero bavuga nari nyoboye barabeshya kuko nari muri hotel mille collines nabambonye barahari hari Uwimana hari abo bose niho nari ndi icyo gitero ntago nari nkirimo kuko nari nibere muri hotel mille collines . ||| You can see well that saying I headed the attack is pure lies because I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . Here are even people who saw me . I can see them here . There is Uwimana and others . I was not part of that attack ; I was at Hotel de Mille Collines .
Nyakubahwa turagirango tukubaze , wenda kuri st michel muvuze ko nta muntu wahaguye murabihamya ? Hari umuntu nzi wahaguye witwa Semuhungu wakoraga muri banque nationale , banque de Kigali yakoraga muri banque de Kigali ngirango aza gukora muri banque nationale nyuma.uwo muntu yarahaguye , . ||| We would like to ask you a question Sir ! Still about Saint @-@ Michel , can you really confirm that no single individual died there ? I know one who died there . His name was Semuhungu . He worked in the National Bank ... I mean Banque de Kigali . I think he first worked in Banque de Kigali and shifted to the National Bank after . The man died there .
wenda uwo reka tumwihorere ariko reka twongere dusubire kuri st famille utwemereye ko wakijije abari muri st michel , na mille colline kubera abajandarume bashoboraga kurinda abo bantu none kuri st famille no kuri st paul abo bajandarume n' iki cyababujije kuharinda hagapfa abantu bangana kuriya n' akantu gato gusa noneho wenda tugatanga ijambo ku baturage bakagira icyo babivugaho ||| Okay , let 's just forget about that one . Let 's come back to the issue of Sainte @-@ Famille . You have just confirmed that you saved people who were in Saint @-@ Michel and Hotel de Mille Collines because the gendarmes could protect them . Why did n't the gendarmes protect Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul center and let such people die ? Talk about that that very minor issue then we give the floor to the audience and listen to their views .
Jyewe nakubwiye yuko abajandarume nohereje kuri abajandarume nohereje kuri abajandarume bari bari kuri hotel mille collines , eglise st famille , centre st paul bari aba compagnie territoriale yari nyarugenge ya groupement Kigali . ||| I told you that the gendarmes I sent to Mille Collinnes , Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul belonged to the Nyarugenge territory company of Kigali formation .
Abo ninde wari ubashinzwe ? ||| Who was in charge of them ?
Hari commanda de groupement wabo wari ubashinzwe yari unity yategekwaga na etat major , njye nkaba narababwiye nti bagiye hariya kurinda abaturage unity nari nshinzwe mu mujyi ni groupe mobile wambaza cathedrale st michel kuko niyo yari muri opposition zanjye . ||| They had the formation commander who was in charge of them . it was a unity under the command of the army staff . I told them to go and protect the population in the places I mentioned . The unity under my command in the capital was the mobile group . You should only ask me about Saint @-@ Michel cathedral because it was in my area .
Muri groupe st famille na st paul ntago wari uhashinzwe ? ||| Do you mean that protecting Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul were not within your duties ?
Hari abasirikare ba compagnie territoriale ya nyarugenge ya groupement kigali . ||| They were under Nyarugenge territory company of Kigali formation
Ishinzwe nde ? ||| Who was the responsible ?
ishinzwe nu buri groupement yari ifite commanda wayo ||| Each formation had its own commander
Yitwaga nde ? ||| What was his name ?
Icyo gihe yitwaga lieutenant colonel Kanimba ayikorera ariko yari bloque hariya ntuza muri camp kacyiru niho yabaye bloque . ||| His name was lieutenant @-@ colonel Kanimba . He was there temporarily but he normally belonged to Kacyiru military camp
Ibyo watwemereye ko wageze st famille na st Paul ||| What about what you said that you once arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul ?
Nagezeyo rwose . ||| Of course I did
Wari ugiye gukiza abantu ba padiri n' abandi bande watubwiye ? ||| You said you were going to save people the priest had recommended . And who else ?
Ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi z' ukwa gatandatu ||| On June 17th ...
Ntacyo wabonye ? ||| Did n't you realize anything strange ?
Nari hamwe na padiri Uwimana tuvana kuri hotel mille colline tujyana kwa padiri Veneche dutwara abantu bari bihishe kwa padiri kwa musenyeri Venesh tubatwara inshuro ebyiri muri cammionet . ||| I was with Father Uwimana from Hotel de Mille Collines . We went together to father Veneche 's and we carried people who were hiding at Father ... Bishop Veneche 's in the pickup . This took us two rounds of times .
President Nyakubwahwa kuri iyo tariki 17.06 , tubona ko igihe twaburanishaga kwa mufungwa witwa Rutabana yasobanuye ko yishe abantu ijana na mirongo inani na batandatu bavanywe mu kiriziya imbere abajandarume bari ku muryango kuko ari bariyeri yari iri kandi muratwemerera ko uwo munsi mwahageze koko ? ||| Please sir ! We learnt from the case of a prisoner going by the name of Rutabana that he killed one 186 people picked from the church where gendarmes settled . There was a barrier too ; can you tell us that you really arrived there ?
Nageze kuri centre st paul no kuri hotel mille collines . ||| I arrived at Saint @-@ Paul and Mille Collines !
Ibyo bintu ntacyo wabidusobanuriraho ? byabo bantu ijana na mirongo inani na batandatu bishwe kuri iyo tariki?kuko byo abantu bangana gfutyo bapfuye ngirango umuntu umwe iyo apfuye apfuye nkahangaha ndumva iyi quartier yose yarara ibimenye , wowe nta kintu wigeze ubimenyaho ? dusobanurire ||| Do n't you think you can explain those things to us ? I mean the 186 people killed on that day . You know ... when only one person dies the whole area can get informed in one day . Did you never know anything ? Explain to us !
Jyewe nakubwiye yuko nari kuri hotel mille collines , ariko se ko abantu bari gusakuza kandi ndimo kuabsobanurira ? ||| I told you that I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . By the way , why are people shouting when I am explaining ?
Baceceke , baceceke tugiye kugera turabaha ijambo , mukanya nako kantu nagirango usobanure . ||| They should keep quiet . Keep quiet ! We are about to give them the floor . We only want you to explain that minor issue .
Abantu baravuze ngo abantu muri ubwo buhamya baguhaye baravuze ngo nijye wari uyoye icyo gitero , jye nakubwiye ko ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi y' ukwezi kwa gatandatu jye nari kuri hotel mille collines twirirwa turwana n' interahamw zo kuri hotel mille collines nahavuye njyana na padiri Uwimana kujya kuzana abantu bari bari muri kwa padiri Veneche kwa musenyeri Veneche mbatwara inshuro ebyiri muri cammionet , ariko depite Rugema yavugaga ngo ntwaye abantu muri cammionet ngo ngiye kubica . ||| In the testimonies you received people said that I headed the attack ! I told you that on June 17th I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . We had been fighting the Interahamwe there all along the day . From there I went with Father Uwimana to pick people from Father Veneche 's .... Bishop Veneche 's . I carried them in two rounds in my pickup . Surprisingly , MP Rugema said that I was going to kill them .
Ibyo twabyumvise , reka dusubire kuri st Michel watubwiye ko nta muntu wahaguye kandi haguye umuntu witwa Semuhungu w' umuryango wuyu ibyo bintu ntago wabimenye nk' umuntu wayoboraga aho hantu ? ||| We have understood that . Let 's go back to Saint @-@ Michel 's issue . You told us no single individual died there whereas there is one called Semuhungu and his family . As the commander of the area , did n't you know that ?
Ntago nigeze mbimenya . ||| No , I did n't
Hari abajandarume bawe ||| There were your gendarmes
Natago nabimenye ||| I did n't know it
Eeh uwo muntu yarahaguye n' umuryango we kandi yari atuye iruhande rwa st Michel ||| Eeh...I got it ! The man and his family died . He lived near Saint @-@ Michel
Na rapport nabonye abapadiri bampaye bambwiye ko abantu bahungiye muri cathedrale st Michel nta muntu wahaguye niko njye abapadiri bambwiye . ||| According to the report I had from the priests , no one of the people who had escaped to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral died . I was told that .
Reka dukomeze , dutange ijambo ku baturage twumve icyo babivugaho ubundi ibindi byo inteko yo ibyinshi wagiye ubivagaho ariko nonehoi reka duhe ijambo abaturage kugirango wumve . ||| Let 's go on ! Let 's give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . You have actually talked about everything . Let 's now listen to the population ; you will get their views as well
Buretse nongere ngire icyo mvuga ||| Allow me to add something !
Ariko muri makeya ? ||| Try to be brief
Muri makeya , ngirango ibi bintu mubikurikirane neza , ejobundi mu kwezi kwa karindwi 2004 , abacitse ku icumu bose bari bari muri iriya zone ku isabukuru y' imyaka icumi bashimiye abayobozi b' igihu ko babatabaye , uwari ubahagarariye yaravuze ati mushimire na lieutenant colonel Munyakazi wadutabaye ntabwo mbeshya nimushaka musakuze commanda wa division wari uhari yabagejejeho ubwo butumwa ari hano abibasobanurire , ||| In a word , I would like to ask you to carefully investigate this case . Some days earlier , at the tenth anniversary July 2004 , all the survivors who were living in that area praised the government authorities for having saved them . Their representative said @: "@ you should also thank also lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi who came to us for help @"@ . You may make noise Yes , but I am not lying ! The division commander who delivered the message is here himself ; he might explain it to you .
abaturage bavuze bati turashimira lieutenant colonel Munyakazi wadutabaye mu bihe bikomeye ubwo butumwa ngo bazabungezeho ubwo butumwa babungejejeho ko natabaye abantu sinumva iyi politique yo guhindura yo kumbeshyera aho itangiriye muri iyo minsi . ||| The population said that they thank lieutenant @-@ colonel who came to them in difficult situations . They recommended delivering the message to me . I had the message that I had saved people . I can not understand the reason for of this trick of bringing fake accusations against me during the last days . Where does it come from ?
Nyakubwhwa ntabwo ari urubanza ||| This is not a trial , Sir !
N' urubanza kukourimo kumbaza ngo ugiye kubwira abantu ngo banze banshinje kandi ejobundi nibo banshimiraga ||| It is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . The very people who were praising me just some days ago !
Nyakubahwa ntabwo navuze ko bagushinja ||| I did not mean to accuse you , Sir !
Ejobundi nibwo banshimiye kumugaragaro banantumaho ngo baranshimira . ||| They have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me .
Ibyo ngibyo ni byiza ni ngombwa , k' umuntu wakoze neza baramushimira ibyo rwose ntago mvuze ngo abantu bagushinje n' ukuvuga ngo tugomba gutanga ijambo kumpande zose ngiye kubanza mu nteko kugirango twumve nabo icyo bavuga . ||| That is a good thing . Any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it . I have not said that people must accuse you . We only have to let the two sides speak . We go to the Court Panel first and listen to their views .
wavuze ko watanze amategeko , watanze amategeko ntiwayakurikirana ? aho hantu harimo ikibazo hapfuye abantu barenga ijana na mirongo inani ntimubimenye mutuye muri kigali kandi umuntu wo muri quartier apfuye imodoka imugonze tugahurura nk' umunyarwanda wari ukomeye mu buyobozi bw' icyo gihe mwagombaga kuba mwarabimenye ? mwagombaga kumenya ibyo bene wanyu bakoze , nubwo iyo compagne territoriale yari iyobowe n' undi arko mwari mufite ubushobozi bukomeye aho rero ntago wavuga ngo twasobanukiwe . ||| You said that you gave orders . Did you give orders and did not follow them up ? The problem arises there . More than 180 people died but you did n't know it . However , we know that when a person dies of a car accident in an area , we all come to see . As a high @-@ ranked Rwandan in the time , you should have known that . You should have known what your colleagues were doing . Tough the territory company was commanded by someone else , you had enough power yourself . You can see that we did not get the point well .
Ngirango yagirango agufate mu mugongo akwreke ko nta gahunda twashyizeho yo kugushinja.kandi akwibutsa kugirango wibuke neza anakwereka niba abo bantu wabajijwe baranapfuye nk' umuyobozi wagombaga kumenya imipfire yabo bantu nibyo yakubwiraga , reka twongere dutange ijambo ahubwo . ||| I think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you . He also reminded you that , as a leader , you should have known the death of the people you have been asked about . That is his point . We go over to someone else
Murakoze president w' inteko twagirango tubaze bwana munyakazi mu makuru dufite hari umugororwa witwa rutabana wari waduhaye amakuru ko ibihe byinshi mwakundaga kuba muri kuri st famille muri kumwe na padiri Munyeshyaka kandi ko ibintu uwo mugororwa yakoraga byose mwabaga mubizi ayo makuru ntimwaba mwayibagiwe tukaba tuyabibukije ? murakoze ko hari n' imirambo mwaba mwarajyanye bataba baramenye aho mwayijyanye ? nabyo mwabitubwira ? ||| Thank you Mister President . According to the information we have ... there is a prisoner called Rutabana who told us that you usually used to come to Sainte @-@ Famille with Father Munyeshyaka and that you were aware of all the things the prisoner could do . I want to ask you mister Munyakazi ; do n't you think you might have forgotten that information and that you have just been reminded ? It is also said that you might have taken some bodies and that the place where you took them is still unknown . You may also tell us about that . Thank you !
Murakoze , iyo bus y' umutuku ntayo nagendagamo rwose nagendaga muri hilux y' umweru . Iy' umutuku ntabwo nigeze nyigendamo n' umushoferi wanwaye wanwaraga ari muri police nationale ntabwo nagenze muri bus y' umutuku ubwo urumva ko hari undi muntu bavuga utari lieutenant colonel munyakazi.icyo ngicyo tugikureho iyo bus y' umutuku ntabwo yagendagamo lieutenant colonel ||| Thank you . I never drove that red bus . I had a white Hilux pickup . Even my driver belonged to the national gendarmerie . I never travelled in the red bus . You can see it is someone else they are talking about not lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . Let 's forget about that ; the red bus never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi .
munyakazi yagendagamo undi muntu kuko jye nagendaga muri cammionet y' umweru urumva ko amakuru abantu bitaga bagiye bavuga izina rya munyakazi kandi atariwe.nagendaga muri bus y' umweru ninayo natwayemo abapadiri n' ababikira mbakura muri eglise st famille , donc uwo muntu wakoraga ibyo bintu ubyitirira colonel Munyakazi ntabwo aribyo banaykubahwa mugize urukiko gacaca murabona ko iyo modoka sinigeze nyigendamo rwose . ||| It carried someone else . I used to travel in a white pickup . You can see that people mentioned the name of Munyakazi whereas it was not him . I used to travel in a white bus , with which I carried priests and nuns from Sainte @-@ Famille church . So the person who did those things wrongfully attributed to colonel Munyakazi .... That is not true Ladies and Gentlemen of gacaca court Panel . I did n't travel in that car at all .
Nyakubahwa ntabwo turimo kuburana hano ||| This is not a trial , Sir !
Turimo kuburana niho bigeze rwose ubu ngubu ||| No this is a trial . It is being proceeded right now !
Ntago ari ukubarana wenda uretse ko ikibazo cyabajije uburyo bwe ariko si ukuburana ||| It is not a trial . He has just asked his question in his own way but this is not a trial .
Icyo kibazo gikureho byose na confusion zose iyo camionnet y' umutu babonye ntabwo yigeze igendwamo na lieutenant colonel Munyakazi , ikindi cya kabiri ntakubwiye ba nyakubahwa mugize urukiko gacaca ndimo kubona bahimba ibintu ngo babingerekeho kandi narakoze uko nshoboye ngo mbatabare . ||| That question must remove all confusions . The red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . The second thing I did n't mention , I guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court Panel , is that I see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas I did my best to protect them .
Ikindi igihe bombe zagwaga kuri eglise st famille naraje ubwanjye njya muri eglise st famille njya guhumuriza abaturage nagiyeyo dufata abarwayi croix rouge yategekwaga na Kayiranga bajya kubavuza muri croix rouge , iyo modoka y' umutuku rwose bababwiye ubwo icyo kirego mukimvaneho kiveho sinigeze nyigendamo . ||| Once Saint @-@ Famille church was being fired at . I myself went to Sainte @-@ Famille church to console the population . We took sick people and they went to be treated in Red Cross infirmary . Red Cross was chaired by Kayiranga in the time . I never travelled in the red car . Remove that accusation completely .
Nyakubahwa icyo n' ikirego uzaburana niba kinahari , ariko wumve ko ntakuburana n' ukugirango tumenye gusa dusobanukirwe ntagobwo twaje tuje guca urubanza twaje kwakira ubuhamya bwawe nkuko wabwisabiye . ||| That is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , Sir ! Of course if it is one . We have not come for trial . You should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself .
Ariko murimo kumbaza ibyo babwiye ||| You are asking me what you 've been told though .
Yeah , barakubaza bagirango basobanukirwe gusa ariko si ukuburana , reka mpe undi mugenzi wanjye akubaze . ||| Of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial . I go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well .
Na Rutabana wari ushinzwe gutanga ibiryo mu nkambi y' impunzi gira icyo utubwira ||| Court Panel According to Rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp
Brai bakikubajije ariko ntacyo kubera ko utamuzi wowe wasobanura ||| You had already been asked the question . As you do not know him , however , it is okay . you may explain
Jyewe nababwiye yuko , jye nababwiye yuko gutanga ibiryo ntabwo kari akazi nari nshinzwe jye nahaye oda ntabwo twaba turi mu ntambara ngo ujye kubona lieutenant colonel munyakazi atanga ibiryo mu mpunzi ntabwo byaba bishoboka rwose , aho ngaho murabona ko abeshya . Jyewe nababwiye ko natanze oda nyiha capitaine Ntirugiribambe ngo abwire abajandarume bajye kuzanira ibiryo impunzi babizane kwa padiri ntabwo nigeze ngira distribution y' ibiryo icyo kirego nacyo ntabwo ari cyo . ||| I told you that distributing food was not among my duties . We can not be in war and see lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi distributing to displaced people . It is not possible at all . You can see well that he completely told lies . I told you that I gave the order to Captain Ntirugiribambe to tell gendarmes to go and bring food for displaced people to Father 's . I never distributed food . That accusation is wrong as well . Remove it too .
Ntabwo cyari ikirego yagirango amenye , urumva ibiryo byo atri ikirego kuko ntawe utarya . ||| It was not an accusation . He just wanted to know . Food can not be an accusation because everyone eats .
Aravuga ko nakoranye niyo nterahamwe gutanga ibiryo kandi lietenant colonel uri mu ntambara ntabwo yabona igihe cyo kujya gutanga ibiryo mu mpunzi . ||| He is saying I and the Interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people .
Nagirango mabze ikibazo cyakubahwa colonel Munyakazi yatanze ingero muri mille collines , muri st famille , no muri st paul , ahantu hose yagiye agerageza kugirira neza abanyarwanda , yabikoraga ku manywaibyo aribyo byose nagirango mubaze niba hari abantu babanyamakuru baba barabonye icyo gikorwa cyiza yakoze.murakoze ||| court panel I want to ask a question . Mister colonel Munyakazi has just examples such as Mille Collines , Sainte @-@ Famille , and Saint @-@ Paul and he tried to help Rwandans everywhere . Probably he was doing that during the day . I would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action . Thank you !
Eeh , abanyamakuru bo mu Rwanda cg bo mu mahanga kuri icyo kibazo , kuri icyo kibazo , kuva muri 1992 , kuva muri 1994 niba mwarabonye ibitabo byandikwaga byose abantu bakundaga kuvugwamo abajandarume bagize uruhare mugutabara abantu twitwaga nabo bose bangag kubivuga kubera ibihe twari turimo , ariko iyo usomye igitabo cya auteur le drpoit survivre cyanditswe na Hibert cyo cyerekana yuko kuri hotel mille colline harinzwe n' abajandarume muri za enquete bakoze akaba ariyo mpamvu hatapfuye abantu niko icyo gitabo cyabyanditse muri za enquete zabo . ||| Right ! About that question ... do you mean Rwandan journalists or foreign ones ? About that question ... About that question ... from 1992...from 1994 ... If you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people . All of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living . However if you read the book le droit de vivre by Hibert , you can see that book shows well that Hotel de Mille Collines was protected by Gendarmes according to the investigations . That is why people did not die there . That is what the book says
kuri cathedrale st michel hari umunyamerika wari hamwe na ziriya mpunzi zo kwa Gisimba nawe twamuvanye inyamirambo tumuzana muri cathedrale st michel , no kwa gisimba na gisimba uriya aziko abajandarume major karangwa ariwe ziriya mpfubyi zose wazigejeje muri position zanjye , ||| There was an American who was with Gisimba 's displaced people in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . We had taken him from Nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral . Even Gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major Karangwa
ariko ibyo ntabwo babivuga , ariko ubu nibura abantu bamenye ko icyo gikorwa cyabayeho noneho rero bageze hariya bamwe baranababwiraga ngo ntibazavuge yuko bakijijwe na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ngo kuko bazamushinja ubwicanyi , ariko inkiko gacaca zirahari mu mpaye uburyo bwo kubabwira yuko abo bajandarume bari bari kuri hotel mille collines nari nabahaye ambwiriza mpa amabwiriza abantu bo kuri cathedrale st michel mpa amabwiriza abajandarume yo kuvoma amazi no kuzana ibiryoniba nibyo murabimenye ubwo murabona yuko nta mugambi wo kugambanira abatutsi nari mfite . ||| Unfortunately this is not evoked . For the time being , however , people should know the action took place . When people arrived there , some were even told not to say they had been saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi because he would be charged of killings later . Fortunately there are gacaca courts ; you have given me the opportunity to tell you that I had given orders to the gendarmes of Hotel de Mille Coliines . I had given orders to people at Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . I also gave orders to gendarmes to go and fetch water and bring food . You have known that too . You can see that I did not intend to plot against Tutsis
Nyakubahwa ibyo nibyiza ibyo wakoze kuri mille collines ni byiza urabishimwa , n' ibintu wakoze nabyo urabishimwa , gusa hari impungenge tuba dufite ku kintu kuko twumva ko wari ufite ubushobozi bwo kukimenya tukakikubaza , turagusaba ko kubera igitinyiro cyawe uravuga abantu bakagira ubwoba bagatinya no kukubaza wifate neza imbere y' urukiko , kwifata neza ntabwo ari ibyo byo kugira gutyo uvuge utuje , abantu batikanga badafite ubwoba cyane ko bavuze ko uri umuntu ukomeye n' icyubahiro cyawe . , n' igitinyiro ufite niba wanarushye ushobora kuba wicaye gatoya bakakubaza ||| Yes sir , that was perfect . What you did at Mille Collines was perfect ! What you did is also recognized . Just because of the power you had in the time , we get curious and worried and we are obliged to ask you questions in order to know . We would also like to ask you to stand appropriately in front of the Court Panel . This is because people fear even to ask due to your dignity . No , by standing appropriately I do not mean standing that way . ; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity . They have said you are an important person so they have much respect for you . If you feel tired you may even sit down so that they may ask you .
Nyakubahwa muri uyu mujyi wa Kigali nuko wenda mutanyemereye urukiko rutanyemereye ariko wenda murza kumpa uruhushya nze kubibabwira kuko nabyo nari nabiteguye , iyo urebye uko unity zari zimeze hano mumujyi wa Kigali ukareba ukuntu nakoze ukuntu nshoboye ngo nshobore gutabara bariya bantu bari bari muri kariya gace ||| You know Sir ... may the Court Panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in Kigali . However , I had prepared it . I hope you will allow me that . When you check well that structure and see how I did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area .....
wabimbwiye uti turabizi turagushimira ni byiza , ariko nanjye sinshaka ko umuntu yaza ngo ambeshyere ngo nagendeye muri cammionet y' umutuku , nayoboye ibitero narindi muyindi position niyo mpamvu nanjye rero nanjye ngomba kwisobanura kugirango ibirego babagejejeho mubone ko ibyo birego nta shingiro bifite kuko urimo kumbwira muri diplomatie ngo ntago barimo kundega ariko jyewe ndabizi ko ngomba kwireguraho . ||| Yes you told me that you thank me for that ! However , I do not want someone to come and wrongfully accuse me of having travelled in the red pickup , of having headed attacks somewhere whereas I was in another area . That is why I have to provide explanations to show you that the accusations presented to you are false though you are trying to talk to me in a diplomatic way that this is not a trial . I have to defend myself .
Wenda ashobora kuba yarabyumvise nabi iyo umbwiye ko wenda nkanjye uri president cg se mu bandi bagize inteko y' urukiko wenda nibwo cyaba ari ikintu kitaricyo ukaba uranagitsinze . ||| May be he was confused about it . If it was me , the President or any other of the Court Panel ; that would really be a fake accusation and you would have won the discussion .
Kuko si ukuburana kandi uriya we yabitiranyije gusa twakubwiraga ngo ujye utumara impungenge kuko hari ibyo tutazi cyane cyane ko wari umuntu ugenda ahantu hose uzi ibintu byinshi byagiye biba ||| This is not a trial . The other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened .
Noneho ubidusobanurire ntago ari ukuburana nta nubwo ari inzira twashatse kugirango uburane twebwe urukiko rw' umurenge nta nubushobozi dufite bwo kukuburanisha ntabwo dufite ubushobozi bwo kukuburanisha na butoya kubera icyubahiro cyawe ntabwo twebwe dufite ubwo bushobozi reka dutange ijambo kumuntu umwe mubagize inteko hanyuma tujye ku bandi . ||| So , we want you to provide us with explanations . This is not a trial . It is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . We are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . We give the floor to someone else
Murakoze kumpa ijambo nagirango nkwibarize utubazo duatatu tw' amatsiko cyane cyane twumvise utsindagira ishyaka MRND ushobora kutubwira ishyaka wari urimo?icya kabiri watwibwiriye ko watanze rapport zihinyuza ibyo babeshyeraga abtutsi reak nkwibarize nk' umuntu wari ufite ubushobozi wajyaga no hanze waganiraga n' abantu waduha nk' abatutsi nkabangahe waba waraburiye?icya gatatu nagirango nkwibarize watubwiye umugabo witwa Ntirugiribambe ese twamukura he ? ese yari ashinzwe iki ? Murakoze ||| Court Panel Thank you . Just out of curiosity tell me about three questions @: you have been evoking MRND a bit a lot ; would you please let us know which political party you belonged to ? Second @: you told us that you drew reports denying the accusations brought against Tutsis . So I want to ask you ; as a high @-@ ranked personality of then who could go abroad at times , how many Tutsis have you warned ? Third @: you told us about a man called Ntirugiribambe . Where can we find him ? What was his responsibility ? Thank you .
Munyakazi Icya mbere umbajije ngo ishyaka nari ndimo , kugera ku itariki ya cumi.06.1991 hari hariho iegeko nshinga abanyarwanda bose nawe wari muri MRND nawe niko byari bimeze abantu bose bari bari muri mrnd , nawe wari urimo kuko umunyarwanda wese yari muri MRND , ||| The first question concerns the political party I belonged to . According to the Rwandan constitution in force till June 10th 1991 , all Rwandans including you adhered to MRND . Surely it was the same for you . All people adhered to MRND . Even you because any Rwandan did .
Nyuma yo ku itariki ya 10.06.1991 hagiyeho itegeko rishyiraho amashyaka menshi , abasirikare nta shyaka bajyagamo , icya kabiri wambwiye ngo wari umbajije uti izo rapports wakoze ngo navuga abatutsi naburiye . ||| After June 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . Soldiers did not adhere to any political party . The second question you asked is about reports I drew and how many Tutsis I might have warned .
izo rapport yuko barimo kubahimbira nazikoze guturuka ku itariki ya mbere igihe batangiraga gufata ibyitso bambwiye ngo nkore verification , kandi naremeye n' umutima wanjye mvugisha ukuri nkora uko nshoboye kugirango ba extremiste batajya gukoresha izindi rangamuntu muzindi imprimerie ngo bazitirire Sisi Evariste ||| I drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . I was told to verify . I committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . I did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at Sisi Evariste 's .
Kandi izo rapport nakoze nubwo twabivuganaga n' abakozi bo muri embassade bazaga kutubaza uko situation imeze niyo yatumye bashyiraho pression president Habyarimana kugirango uriya mugambi wo kurimbura abatutsi udakorwa , batangire bafungure n' abantu , n' abantu batangiye gufungurwa n' abafunguwe barahari president Habyarimana yaravuganga ngo nimwongere gufungura mujye mureba abafunguwe ||| I also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . That is why they started putting pressure on Habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating Tutsis and start releasing people . People were released . There are even people who were released . Habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore You should check those who are being released @"@ .
Mukwezi kwa kane.1991 ariko iyo tudakora izo rapport tukajya muri uwo mugambi wo gufunga abatutsi tubahimbira twari kuba dukoze nabi , jye nkubwiye ko iyo rapport yagize akamaro kuko nabwiye abanyamahanga nti natwe twakoze verification twasanze barabeshyera abatutsi .icya gatatu n' ikihe ? Uwo Ntrugiribambe yari commanda wa territoriale ya Nyarugenge yarahunze yagiye muri Zaire ntabwo aho ari mpazi.murakoze . ||| In April 1991 ... It would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing Tutsis for fake accusations . I am telling you ; the report served a lot because I told foreigners that we had verified and found out that Tutsis were innocent . What was the third question again ? Ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of Nyarugenge . He exiled to Zaire . I do not know where he might be right now . Thank you !
Reka twakire abo bantu oya buretse uravuga umwirondoro wawe ||| Let 's first listen to these people . Hold on ! You will first introduce yourself , later ...

Utubwize ukuri rero , ntutubeshye . ||| You shall say the truth . Do not lie to us !
Ikintu cya mbere nuko mwamaze kwivugira ko ari ikusanyamakuru , jyewe rero nkaba ngirango mabshe kwibutsa uyu muvandimwe muri dukeya mbasha kugenda nanjye nibukaho , ||| You have already said that this information collection . I would like to remind my brother some few things I can remember .
muri 1990 igihe ntibukaho amatariki n' ukwezi , icyo gihe badukoresheje inama ku Kimihurura ai kumwe na Renzaho Tharissise badukoresha inama ikomeye cyane batubwira ngo , umunyarwanda utuye umujyi uwo ariwe wose afite gusubira ikigali aho avuka , nimba bidashobotse ko bafite abasirikare bahagije mu gihugu ko bafite n' amasasu ko umunyarwanda uwo ariwe wese azaraswa isasu , ||| In 1990 , I do not remember the month and date , he co @-@ presided over a very big conference I attended at Kimihurura . He was with Renzaho Tharcisse . They told us that any Rwandan living in Kigali had to return to his or her place of birth . Otherwise , they had enough soldiers in all over the country and bullets so that every Rwandan would be shot at .
icyo gihe Re nzaho arangiza avuga ngo birenge niwowe ubwira ! Ako kantu katubereye urujijo kuburyo tutazi icyo kahamuraga ndetse benshi twari tutaramenya icyo bishaka kugeraho , ubwo nyuma yaho ndashaka kuvuga muri makeya mumbabarire , nyakubahwa muyobozi wa jandarumeri iyco gihe wari umukuru wa jandarumeri , wadusanze ahntu muri st famille uranzi jyewe ? Jyewe uranzi ? ||| Renzaho ended saying @: "@ a word to a wise is enough ! @" This saying was a puzzle to us . We could not figure out what it meant . Many of us could not know what this intended to . I beg your pardon , I want to be very brief . A long time after , you , the then Gendarmerie commander , joined us somewhere in Sainte @-@ Famille . Do you know me ? Do you ?
Nagirango mbanze nguhe ubuhamya bwanjye , wadusanze muri st famille wari kumwe n' abambari bawe benshi ubwo ni ntambara ariko noneho mbere intambara ijya gutangira ni mwebwe mwayitangiye n' abajepe bo ku kimihurura muza kuvuga mu Kimicanga ngo nibatangire bazamure abatutsi mu aho bari aho ariho hose ngo mubashyire ku muhanda , ngo nibatabazamura ngo n' umuhutu utabazamuye ngo muramwica . ||| I want to give you my testimony first . You joined us in Sainte @-@ Famille during the war . You were with your men . They were so many . Meanwhile , before the war started ... you yourself and the republican guard at Kimihurura triggered off the war . When you were at Kimicanga , you ordered that all Tutsis be taken uphill . You added that you would kill even a Hutu who refused to bring them uphill .
Ubwo ngubwo nibwo nahise mpunga hari samunani undebe neza rwose kuko ntago nkubeshyera muvandimwe , ubwo hari nko mu masamunani nibwo nahise mpunga nza mu kiyovu nahamaze iminsi itatu icyo gihe ni wowe wakontrolaga umujyi wose na Renzaho n' abandi basirikare ntazi kuko nkuzi ukiri na lieutenant kuburyo wajyaga ugenda wigira gutya ngo nijye ukuriye gendarmerie yose imodoka zose n' izanjye , ibintu byose bya gendarmerie n' ibyanjye , ||| I escaped from then . It was 2 pm. Look at me carefully . I am not wrongfully accusing you . I escaped to Kiyovu . I spent three days there . You controlled the entire city together with Renzaho and other soldiers . Even when you were still lieutenant , you would say that you commanded the gendarmerie , that all gendarmerie 's cars were yours , that all the property of the gendarmerie were your own property
Nyakubahwa jyewe nta kintu mpfa nawe Imana imbabarire ariko icyo nzicyo ibyo bavuze bose ukavuga ngo barakubeshyera ushatse watubabarira kuko turahari turi benshi urabizi twagirango twibukiranye amakuru murakoze . ||| You know Sir ; I do not have anything against you . I would advise that you accepted all that has been said and that you consider as lies . We are many witnesses for that . You know that we only wanted to remind each other .
Abo duha ijambo bose turabaha iminota batarenza ||| We shall give to each speaker minutes not to go beyond .

Ba uretse , ba uretse , urabanza uzamure ikiganza cy' iburyo uti jyewe izina ryawe ntanze Imana ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri ||| Wait a bit ! You first raise your right hand and swear @: "@ I , your name , swear to God that what I am going to say is true @"@ .
Jyewe Gasasira Jean Marie Mourice , ntanze Imana ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri ||| I , Gasasira Jean Marie Maurice , swear to God that what I am going to say is true .

Mu by' ukuri uwo twahaye umwanya yisabiye gutanga ubuhamya umwanya twamuhaye ntabwo twawunganisha nawe reka uko mungana subiza amaso inyuma urebe wenda harai n' abandi bari buduhe ubuhanya batanu , ubwo se ubwo buhamya bwafata igihe kingana gutyo keretse nawe niba ushaka kutubwira kuva muri 1959?kutubwira ikintu cyagenze niba wenda hari ibyo umuvaho by' icyaha yaba yarakoze ugwe ku cyaha neza utagombye gukata cyane ngo unyure inyuma ||| In fact , he asked to give his testimony . We can not give you the same minutes as him considering your number . Try to look behind you ; there are other people . We might even receive testimonies from five people . You can see that the testimonies can not take such a time unless you want to tell us stories from 1959 as well ! In case you want , say , to evoke something wrong he did , just go straight .
Murakoze president namwe nyangamugayo kuri generale major munyakazi ubu turi mu ikusanya n' amakuru make mbaha ubundi ni ukubasa ko mubyo twakwifuza bya mbere mwakwihutisha dossier tuzakomeza no murukiko kuko ibyo tumurega ni ||| Thank you mister President and you ladies and gentlemen ! We are just at the information collection stage . I will only say few . I would also like to ask you to speed the proceedings because we have many accusations against him .
byinshi reka rero tubahe amakuru make ubwo nibindi muzatwereka aho tuzabijyna kuko birahari , generale major munyakazi yaje inshuro nyinshi muri st famille imodoka ya cammionet yanze mukanya ndayibagaragariza jyewe kuko niyo yamuzaga imbere imuherekeje ||| Let us just give you little information . You shall probably show us where to give more . We actually do have more . Major General Munyakazi came to Sainte @-@ Famille many times . He was escorted by the pickup he has denied , which car travelled before his .
yari afite iyo agendamo iyo yari imuherekeje yazaga mbere imodoka hilux itukura yari yanditseho komini nyarugenge , mrnd komini nyarugenge izo hilux se ntabwo muzizi muri uyu mujyi ? imodoka itukura yanditseho ngo komini nyarugenge hejuru habanzaga ngo mrnd , munsi hakazaho ngo komini nyarugenge izo hilux zirazwi hano mu mujyi abazi st famille abari st famille turibukiranya . ||| He had his own car . The red one usually rolled before his . The car bore the script COMMUNE NYARUGENGE ... MRND COMMUNE NYARUGENGE . Do n't you all know those cars in this city ? The car bore the script COMMUNE NYARUGENGE above which MRND and COMMUNE NYARUGENGE was below . Such pickups were known in this city . People who were at Sainte @-@ Famille may remind each other .
Icyo gihe mu nterahamwe zazaga zimuherekeje we yazaga we yifitiye abajandarume be nkuko yabibibwiriye yayoboraga muri camp muhima , iyo bazga muri st famille yababwiye abapadiri bose ariko bitangaje nk' umuntu nka Munyakazi wari major ayoboye gendarmerie hano atigeze narimwe adukomoreza kuri Munyeshyaka akivugira Celestin , ||| When he came to Sainte @-@ Famille he was always accompanied by Interahamwe . But he had his gendarmes as he already said . It is surprising , however , that , as a commander of Muhima military camp , he did not mention the name of Munyeshyaka among the priests but only limited himself to Celestin .
munyeshyaka muzi ibyo yakoreye iki gihugu , twiribwa turirima isi n' amahanga Munyeshyaka , munyeshyaka yarinjiraga akinjira kwa munyeshyaka mubiro bye bagakoreramo inama n' undi musirikare bitaga homonie wabaga aturutse muri sm . ||| You all know what Munyeshyaka did in this country . We always say his name . He is even known abroad . Munyakazi usually came to Munyeshyaka 's office where they held meetings together with another priest who was the army chaplain in ESM .
uyu nguyu munyakazi ari hano , iyo bamaraga kwinjiramo icyo gihe nta kindi cyakurikiraga uwo homonie amazina ye tuzayabaha mu bundi buhamya nyakubahwa president reka rero mbabwire abantu bakuwe muri st famille n' ukuntu bagiye bakurwamo . ||| The very Munyakazi here present ... After they entered the office , all other activities stopped . We will tell you the names of the army chaplain in other cessions . Mister President , I am now going to tell you the names of people who were taken from Sainte @-@ Famille and how they were taken .
Mu kwa kane mu matariki ashyira hafi kuri makumyabiri n' umunani munyakazi uyu nguyu yarinjiye muri st famille ajya kwa munyeshyka bica abantu , abantu bari st famille mubyibuke ahangaha , padiri Wensilas munyeshyaka yari yambaye anti bar , uyu yari yambaye imyenda ya gendarmerie na pistori iri mu giposhete cy' umweru aravuga ngo uyu munsi icyo ashaka ni abatutsi bari muri st famille akinjiramo nyakubahwa president uze gukurikirana aho ngaho n' abandi bantu twari turi kumwe aha ngaha muri st famille , icyo gihe yari yazanye n' interahamwe z' imihanda yose , hari haje icyo gihe gikondo , hari haje muhima , hari haje rugenge nararebaga abo iwacu nyarugenge munyakazi yari ahari na Renzaho prefet w' umujyi . ||| Shortly before April 28th , this man came to Sainte @-@ Famille . He went to Munyeshyaka 's and they killed people . I call upon people who were in Sainte @-@ Famille to remember well . Father Wensislas Munyeshyaka wore a bullet @-@ proof . this one wore the gendarmerie uniform and had a pistol in his white pocket . He said @: "@ what I want today is tutsis who are in Sainte @-@ FAMILLE @"@ . I beg you , mister President and other people who were in Sainte @-@ Famille with me , to follow up well this issue . He entered . He had come with Interahamwe from everywhere ; Gikondo , Muhima , Rugenge , I could even see my neighbors of Nyarugenge . Munyakazi and Renzaho , the prefect of the capital , were present as well .
Abi wacu rugenge bazamutse muzi ibitero bine byari bihagaze kuri st famille Renzaho prefet yari ahari n' uyu munyakazi na inspectrice . ||| Those of our area , Rugenge had also come uphill . You remember four groups that were at Sainte @-@ Famille I guess . Renzaho , Munyakazi and the school inspector were all present .

I just want that we may remind each other . In regard to the attack I am going to talk about , -@ I have already told you that the Interahamwe had all come uphill @- it is clear that it had already been planned since they all met there ; what means they were coming to kill Tutsis at Sainte @-@ Famille @: those from Muhima , Rugenge and Gikondo were all present .

I will also tell you Tutsis who died on the altar . Munyakazi was also there if he remembers well . I am now going to tell you the Interahamwe from my area Rugenge . If it does please to him , he will also let us know those from Muhima and Gikondo because he was their commander . Those from Rugenge included .

They are 18 @: among them was a man from Gikondo who covered his head with a veil disguising himself in a woman . Munyeshyaka himself ... Wensislas Munyeshyaka said not to put the 18 people among others . They were all taken to Renzaho 's .

I beg you , mister President , to go to the field so that we may prove what we are saying @: how he exercised his power and what happened under his authority . The people were tied with shirts and put into the pickup . Your own pickup , Mister Munyakazi , was white as you said but another before yours packed those people first .

It was clear that they were coming to Sainte @-@ Famille . When the people were taken , it was said they were going to give information about Inyenzi and residence certificates . We never knew what happened after . I beg him to tell us where they were taken @: what happened to those who proved innocent and those who were guilty so that we may even worthily bury them . The last thing , mister President , after having asked him about those who were taken to Renzaho 's .... -@ I guess I also have that right @-

But before I leave , I would like to ask you one thing @: he has been continuously evoking Rugema Donatien . He came to Sainte @-@ Famille escaping . You all know Rugema Donatien was jailed among accomplices in 1990 . I have a close family relationship with him ; he is my uncle .
Rugema yaravuze ati mu bantu nshitse harimo Munyakazi yaje ataka ati mumenye ko ibintu byanyu birangiye uyu munsi , Rugema mwese muramuzi kimihurura bari bamaze kumwicira umugore bamwicira n' abana , ageze muri st famille no kugirango ahagere nuko bari bamaze kumutera iwe Munyakazi ahora amukubitira agatoki ku kandi jyeRugema ni marume kandi kandi nzagirana communication nawe mumenyeshe ko twatangiye imanza za munyaakzi mu rukiko ||| Rugema said @: "@ among people I have just escaped from , there is Munyakazi @"@ .

He arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille after his house had been attacked . Munyakazi had always been swearing to harm him . Rugema is my uncle . I will even communicate to him that Munyakazi 's case is being proceeded in the tribunal .

I accuse him of torturing Tutsis and people who were jailed among accomplices . He here is now ! I do not want to be too long mister President . We will be together in tribunals . I am asking you two things , Mister Munyakazi , in very strict words @:
nkuko mubibona mu ikusanyamakuru natwe twakoze ikusanyamakuru ry' abacu twabuze twagiye twumva amagambo amwe yagiye akoresha mu ntambara abahungaga niko batubwiraga abashoboye guhunga bakinjira muri st famille mu minsi ya mbere batubwiye ko munyakazi hariya kuri sopetrad muri rugenge yahanyuza avuga ngo ko nta myand amukura hano?bivuga abatutsi bamubwiye ko nta bikoresho , n' amakuru natwe twakusanyije kugirango turengera abacu kuko natwe nta kindi badusaba ||| As you can see , this is still the information collection step . We have also tried to collect information concerning the people we lost . We heard of many things from people who happened to arrive at Sainte @-@ Famille during the first days . They told us that Munyakazi had been at SOPETRAD asking whether there was no shit to be cleaned off . That means Tutsis . He was answered that there were no tools . That is the information we have also collected so that justice for our people might be done . That is all they expect .
badusaba gukurikirana urupfu rwabo kuko iyo myanda iyo tuyimenya twari kuyishyingura bazatubwire rero aho iyo mynda yacu iri ubwo tuzayishyingura kuko ari umwanda icya nyuma rero nyakubahwa president nkuko mwabyiboneye reka twe kuvuga byinshi tuzakomezanya mu nkiko ariko rero ikibazo cy' umutekano wacu nawe ubwawe ubonye uko avugira aha mu kanya yakwirenza generale murakoze . ||| They expect us to follow up their death because if we had known where that shit is , we would have buried it . They should tell us where our shit is then we shall bury it because it is just shit ! I do not want to be too long . We will be together in tribunals . The last thing , mister President , is about our personal security . You have just seen the way he is talking here ! The general might kill someone I swear ! Thank you .

Nagirango nyakubahwa generale majoro munyakazi yatubwiye ibintu birebire ariko ngirango genocide bayibara mu kwacumi , itariki ya mbere 1990 kugeza mu kwacumi na kabiri 1994.yatubwiye ko hari ikinamico yakinwe bagafata abatutsi bagambiriye kubica , ||| I want to .... Mister Major General Munyakazi , you had told us a long story . However I think genocide took place between October 1st 1990 and December 1994 . He also told us about the invented scenario after which Tutsis were arrested in order to kill them .
Mumubaza mwavuze muti turashaka ibintu bitatu , uruhare rwawe ibyo wabonye n' ibyo wumvise , uruhare ntarwo watweretse , muri mirongo icyenda igihe barasga nari aha muri Kigali , nziko abantu benshi bafashwe na nyakubahwa generale major munyakazi akiri major , nagirango mubaze yavuze ko ari ibintu bari bahimbye we abo yafataga ko yafashe benshi yabyemeraga ko ari ibibeshyo akajyana abantu we yabibonaga ate ? ||| When you asked him you said that you want three things ; his role , what he saw and what he heard . You did not show us your role . In 1990 , at the time of the shootings I was here in Kigali . I know that many people were arrested by major General Munyakazi when he was still Major . He said that it was an invented scenario . I want to ask him why he arrested people knowingly . How did he consider that ?
Ikindi abantu benshi muri stade hariya regionale baramutakambiye kuko yari afite ububsah buhambaye , mu bantu yagiriye neza hari umugore umwe yarekuye abandi barahagwa yatubwiye ko yakoze rapport ariko jye nkaba ntabyemera kuko iyo aza kuyikora aba yaragiriye nabo bantu bo kuri stade bagataha yarabajyanye ajya kubafunga ||| Second . At Nyamirambo Regional Stadium , many people called upon him for help because he was in a vey good position for that . Among people he helped , there is one woman he released and she went home . Others perished there . He told us he drew a report but I do not agree with him because if he had really drawn the report , he would have released the people from the stadium . On the contrary , he took them to jail .
Ikindi igitugu cy' amahanga mwese murakizi nabatari ino mwasomye ibinyamakuru nicyo cyabokeje kugirango barekure abo bitaga ibyitso none we ko atatweretse uwari ari gufata abantu akaba yatubwiye ko yakijije abapadiri n' ababikira abaturage ijana na mirongo inani nabangahe bakagwa kuris t famille akatubwira ko atabibonye atanabyumvise ubwo murabona koko uyu nyakubahwa ko yarahiye ko azavugisha ukuri murabona hari ukuri azavugisha ? Nawe abidusubize kuko byatangiye kugaragara . Murakoze ||| Third. You all know the international pressure . Even those who were not in the country might have read newspapers . That pressure made them release those they called accomplices . Why did n't he show us who was arresting people but only told us that he saved priests and nuns and did neither see nor hear of the death of more than 180 people at Sainte @-@ Famille ? Do you really think this gentleman will tell the truth as he swore ? He should spare our worries because the situation has already started worrying us ! Thank you .

Eeh , murakoze banyakubahwa mushinzwe inteko y' urukiko gacaca muri make icyo navuga kuri Munyakazi kuko mwaduhaye umwanya muto sindibuvuge byinshi eeh intambara yabaye ndi ku Muhima ubwicanyi niho bwatangiye ndi nahavuye ku itariki cumi n' enye mpungishijwe n' umuntu angeza kuri st famille ||| Eeh , thank you ladies and gentlemen of the gacaca court Panel . I will only say little of Munyakazi . I will not say much since we have been given a short time . When the war broke off I was at Muhima . I was there when killings started . I left there on 14th with the help of someone who took me to Sainte @-@ Famille
eeh ku itariki cumi n' enye maze kuhagera twarahiriwe ku itariki cumi n' eshanu twarahiriwe dusa nkabahungiye ubwayi mu kigunda nibwo Munyakazi yaje ari na Renzaho yohereza interahamwe mu kiriiya batangira kutwicaza mu kiriziya batangira kugenda bajonjora abantu babapakira muri hilux yagiye avuga itukura , bagenda bakora amaturu bakoze amaturu umunani biza kurangira ubwo babonaga abasore babonaga ko bafite ingufu bose babonaga ko bagabanutse bibandaga kubasore cyane . ||| Eeh ... we spent there all the day on 14th and 15th . It seemed escaping from the rain under a sweating tree . Munyakazi came with Renzaho . He sent Interahamwe into the church . They started seating us in the very church and picking up people whom they packed in the red pickup he has often evoked . They carried them in eight rounds till they saw strong young men had almost finished . They mainly took young men
Eeh biza kubaho wenda mu magambo avunaguye haje kuza Minuar ishaka kujyana abantu bashaka kujya muri zone ya FPR Minuar yahereye muri mille coline twe yadukozeho nk' ituru ebyiri gusa izi interahamwe zikajya zitangira abantu ibintu bisa nibihagarara , itariki ntibuka neza ariko ndumva hari nko kukitariki cumi n' eshanu z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu nibwo Minuar yaje eeh badukoresha inama batubwira ko bazadutwara ||| Eeh ! Then after ... I will be brief . MINUAR came . They wanted to take people who wanted to go to the area controlled by RPF . MINUAR started by Mille Collines . We were carried in about two rounds . However Interahamwe could stop people at times but things ceased after on the date I do not remember well . It was probably on June 15th when MINUAR came . Meanwhile , they gave us a conference and told us they would come to take us .
eeh hinjiyemo Renzaho Munyakazi we muri st famille hasaga nkaho ariwe kuko yarahahoraga buri gihe cyane ko bakundaga kuza bafite ihene bakabaza kuba ariho barira muri ayo mazu ya bapadiri , hari hasigaye umupadiri umwe witwaga Wensisilasi Munyeshyaka buri kanya buri sha yarazaga nta gihe yabaga Atari kuri st famille bareba ako abasore baba bamaze kugwira ngo bongere babatware ||| Eeh ! Renzaho entered . For Munyakazi , Sainte @-@ Famille was like his home because he usually came there . They usually came there with goats and asked to have their meal in priests ' buildings . The only priest who stayed there was called Wensislas Munyeshyaka . He [ Munyakazi ] was at Sainte @-@ Famille every time and every single hour . They were checking whether the number of young men was enough so that they might carry them out .
Bagakuramo bamwe na bamwe bakabatwara biza kugera noneho ko bumvise ngo Minuar igiye kudutwara nibwo habaye akanama aho aho abapadiri bararaga baravuga ngo aba basore nibaramuka bagiye FPR iraba ibonye ingufu iraba Epa ibonye abasirikare nibwo bavugaga ngo nibaramuka batwaye bazatware abana , abasaza n' abagore ||| They sometimes picked some and carried them out . Once they heard that MINUAR would come to take us . They met and said that in case young men were taken , RPF would gain much force . It would gain soldiers . It was decided that in case people would be taken , it had only to be children , old men and women
ubwo byabaye gutyo bibaye gutyo Munyakazi ubwe Munyeshyaka , na na Renzaho bahagaze aho babwira umudamu witwaga Ngerina ngo namanuke azamure interahamwe ze zitugote , ubwo murabona baravuze ngo abasore baramutse bagiye bose ngo cyane cyane bakubitiyeho bariya ba ubwo babivugaga ari ku itariki ya cumin a gatandatu ubwo noneho nibwo babwiye Ngelina ngo abwire ba basore bamanuke bagote st famille ||| At that time , Munyakazi himself , Renzaho and Munyeshayaka were standing there . They told a lady called Angelina to go and come with her Interahamwe in order to circle us . Let 's see ... they were discussing about the departure of young men on 16th That was the time they also told Angelina to come with her men to surround Sainte @-@ Famille
ngo nabo bagiye kuzana abandi iryo joro ryose haraye hagotswe igitondo cyose Munyakazi we ubwe uyu aza apakira amena inyuma ya kiriziya yongera asubirayo igihe cyo mu masatatu nibwo batangiye gusimbuka ikigo baravuga ngo barase uwitwa umusore wese ntibarase abagore babareke ||| They [ Munyakazi and others ] said that they would be bringing others during the whole night . The place was circled by the morning . Munyakazi himself came and went to carry them and dropped them behind the church . About 9 , they started climbing and getting into the enclosure . They ordered to only shoot at young men and not women
Ubwo baradufataga bakatwicaza hamwe bakaturasa urufaya batwicaje hasi ubwo ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi nibwo Minuar yagombaga kuza kudutwara yahise iza ubwo iza abo batari bishe bari batwicaje hasi ubwo Munyakazi we ubwo uhakana yahise yinjira mu kiriziya amaze kwinjira na Renzaho yahise avuga ngo repris ngo repris Minuar yaje ||| We were seated and some of us were opened rapid fire at . We were seated on the floor . MINUAR came on 17th . It arrived . Those who were not killed , we were seated on the floor . Munyakazi who is defending himself entered and cried @: "@ withdraw ! Withdraw ! MINUAR are there !
abo mutarica mubahagurukane mugende mubicire hanze y' ikigo , ubwo nanjye narahagurutse muri abo ngeze mu muryango wa st famille ahinjira muri economat hari ama continerie abahabaga barayazi yabaga ku muryango ubwo nahagaze gutya aba ba Munyakazi barimo babuza minuar kwinjira ubwo nasubiye inyuma gatoya mpita njya hagati yizo continerie ||| "@ get out with those you have not yet killed and kill them outside @"@ . I also stood up among them . when I reached Sainte @-@ Famille ’ s door to the steward 's office , while Munyakazi and his colleagues were preventing MINUAR from getting in , I went to hide between containers which were there . Those who lived there know it .
Kuko nari umwana ntabwo bambonye kuko nabo barabihutishaga bababwira ngo bagende ubwo abo batari bishe bari bake cyane baragiye babicira hanze . Ubwo noneho ku itariki gato nyuma yahoo nimugoroba Munyakazi yahise agaruka ari kumwe na Munyeshyaka baduteruza izo ntumbi bajya kuzihisha mu igaraje rya economat generale ngo minuar itazibona . ||| they did not see me because I was very small and they were rushing . They told them to follow the way ; I mean the very few who were not yet killed . They went to kill them outside . Some few days after , Munyakazi came back in the evening . He was with Munyeshyaka . They told us to carry the bodies . They went to hide them in the garage of the steward general 's office so that MINUAR might not see them .
Bageze aho ubwo Munyakazi aragenda ku itariki ya cumi n' icyenda ubwe yarigarukiye Munyakazi uyu nguyu ari kumwe na Ngelina ari kumwe na Munyeshyaka ngo barimo barashaka imbunda iri kubarasa ariko si imbunda bashakaga barebaga abasore ababa barimo batabashije kwicwa , ||| They left and on 19th Munyakazi himself came back with Angelina and Munyeshyaka . They said they wanted to see the gun which had been shooting at them . They did not want to have the gun actually ; they were looking for young men they might have not killed
Munyakazi we ubwe yaratwicaje bakagenda abareba abasore babasohora babajyana mu kimodoka cyari gihagaze hanze iruhande rwa za contiers cya minibus niba cyari cyaravuye he simbizi absore bagenda babicazamo bamaze kubicazamo jyewe ubwanjye nasigaye inyuma hari akabari uyu mugabo yari afite k' umugabo witwaga Nzeyi kera agitanga za permis ninaho yajyaga ajya kuzitangira kugirango bamuhe udufaranga . ||| Munyakazi seated us and they picked young men whom they took into the minibus that stationed next to containers outside . I do not know where it had been taken from . Young men were seated in it . I stayed behind . This man owned a bar where Nzeyi worked . He [ Munyakazi ] even used to deliver driving licenses there some time ago in order to earn a little money .
Umugabo witwa Nzeyi niwe wamukoreraga ubwo twajyaga duhurira muri ako kabari ka Nzeyi nsigara inyuma njya kumubwira Munyakazi rwose ntabwo turi inyenzi ahubwo turi impunzi ubwo turamanuka umwe muri abo basore asa nkusimbuka ngo agwe mu igaraje rya ecomat generale Munyakazi na Munyeshyaka bahita bagenda basa nkabamukurikiye ubwo nanjye mpita nsubira inyuma ||| The man called Nzeyi was his employee . We could sometimes meet in Nzeyi 's bar . I stayed behind and I went to tell Munyakazi that we were not Inyenzi but displaced people . We were about to go downhill a bit . One of the young men tried to get off the car and enter the steward general 's office garage . Munyakazi and Munyeshyaka followed him . And I moved back .
mugusubira inyuma hari abagore begereye ku ivuriro hari ivuriro rivura barambwira bati icara hasi abagore bahita banyorosa ibitenge bahita banyicara ni ruhande abo basore biriwe bicaye aho mu gihe cy' umugoroba uyu mugabo ubwe Generale major mureba aha uhakana ibintu byinshi niba ahakana ariko n' Imana izabimushinja yaragarutse nimugoroba abo basore ubwe arabitwarira abo basore harimo uwo bitaga Gasongo Munyensanga harimo uwiga Aloys , hari uwitwaga Ignace abo nibo nibuka ko aribo twari tuziranye cyane ||| In so doing , ladies who worked in the infirmary that was there told me to sit down . They covered me with loincloths and sat by me . The young men sat there all along the day . In the evening , this man himself , Major General in front of you , came back . I do not know ... Though he is denying God will accuse him ! He himself carried away the young men . There were among them Gasongo Munyensanga , Uwiga Aloys , Ignace . I can only remember those because they were very close to me
Noneho Ubwo abo basore uwo mugoroba abijyaniye aho yabashyize ntituhazi niba hari akzi yabahaye ntitubizi turagirango ubwe Munyakzi atubwire aho yadushyiriye abo basore bacu yarabatwaye bari absore cumi n' umunani arabatwara wenyine ubwe nubwo yahakanaga ngo ntiyakoranye n' interahamwe yinjiye mu kiriziya ari kumwe n' interahamwe ari cumi n' ebyiri ntago zari nyinshi nta n' umupolisi bari kumwe yariwe ||| He carried the young men that evening . We do not know where he took them . Whether he employed them or ... we do not know . he should tell us where he might have kept our young men . He carried them away ; they were 18 . He took them away himself and only him ! Though he said he had no connection with Interahamwe , he once entered the church with twelve Interahamwe . They were not many and there was no policeman .
na Ngelina na munyakazi , izo nterahamwe zaje kugenda kumugoroba , niba yaragarutse kubatwara rero natubwire aho yadushyiriye abasore nkaba ndangije njyewe nkuko mugenzi wanjye yabivugaga uyu mugenerale major arakomeye natwe nanjye mfite impungenge z' umutekano wacu ||| Angelinana and Munyakazi were there . The Interahamwe left in the evening . Because he came back to take them away , he should tell us where he put our young men . I am almos through but , like my colleague , I also worry about my personal security .

Ngaho tubwize ukuri ||| Tell us the truth then
Ndakubabwiza , Jyewe ikintu cya mbere nuko uyu Munyakazi ariwe watwitumiye we ubwe atwitumiye niwe wari wadutumiye . ||| I will tell you the truth . The first thing is that this very Munyakazi himself invited us .
Munyakazi yari yatubwiye nta buhamya yaduhaye ari kwivuga imyato abatutsi barapfuye abanyaruhengeri barabishe n' abanyagisenyi ibyo sibyo twashakaga kuko ibyo turabizi . ||| What Munyakazi told us is not a testimony at all . It is just a eulogy of his . Tutsis died . People from Ruhengeri killed them . what he said was not our expectation . We already know it .
None jyewe icyo mbwira Munyakazi nuko munyakazi yagumye akica abantu nubungu baramushinja.jyewe munyakazi ndamushinja nk' umuntu wabaye muri st Famille ||| What I am telling Munyakazi is that he kept killing people and now people are accusing him . I am accusing him as well as someone who was at Sainte @-@ Famille .
nahungiyemo kuri cumi n' icyenda icyenda na kane , mvamo intambara irangiye munyakazi rero hari abantu babaye muri st famille bakaba bataramubona neza njye ndamuzi neza anyitegereze we ubwe yanyihagarariye hejuru amagambo yambwiye aramwibutsa ko yavuze ngo ntabizi ngo ntiyahageze ||| I went there on 19th ... 14th . I left when the war ended . There are people who were at Sainte @-@ Famille but have not seen him yet well . I beg him to stare at me carefully . He himself , stood by me wile I was sitting down . I will remind him the words he pronounced then he will remember as he said he does not know anything .
Munyakazi ubwe abanza kuza muri st famille ariko mwaduhaye iminota mike , munyakazi yaraje atwara umugore witwa Chantal atwara n' abandi basore bagera ku munani abajyana muri hilux avuga ngo abajyanye muri mille collines abo basore niba bakiriho n' amahirwe kuko uwo gore niwe nkibona wenyine ||| Munyakazi himself first came to Sainte @-@ Famille .... We 've been given few minutes by the way ! Munyakazi came and took away one lady called Chantal and about eight young men . He carried them in a pickup and he said he was taking them to Mille Collines . If the young men are still alive it might be just luck ; I can only see the woman today .
Ubwo aravuga ngo ntiyazaga muri st famille ? Ndamwibutsa munyakazi ubwe amaze kujyana abo ngabo uko yazaga muri st famille rwose yarahahoraga , iyo yabaga ari kwa Munyeshyaka interahamwe bazanaga yasaga nk' umuntu wagiye ku isambu batwaraga abantu uko byagendaga kose , yarazaga yajya kugenda abo bafashe bakabapakira mumodoka ya hilux n' ubwo yavuganga ngo niyayizanaga nyamara twe twararebana nubwo inzara yari yaratwishe . ||| Why is he saying he did not use to arrive at Sainte @-@ Famille ? I will remind him . After having taken those people ... He was always at Sainte @-@ Famille . When he came to Munyeshaka 's , he was like in his own property . He , with the Interahamwe of his company , always took people with them . When he was about to leave , they could put people into the pickup . Though he is saying he did not , we could see it starving though .
Ubwo byakurikiyeho ubwo avuga ngo ntiyajyaga ahaza wowe munyakazi waraje ubwo wari umaze kuva kureba abntu bo muri mille collines wowe ubwawe , uraza uhagarara hagati mu kayira kari mu mbuto hagati zo mu kiriziya haruguru y'kigega cy' amazi uraza uravuga ngo abntu bashaka ko babuhungisha nibaze . ||| Though he is saying he did not use to arrive at Sainte @-@ Famille ... you yourself Munyakazi ! After you had just seen people at Mille Collines , you came and stood in the middle of the path in the church garden near a water tank . You said @: "@ those who want to be facilitated to escape should come with me @"@ .
Twarahuruye twumva ko ari impuhwe ugiye kutugirira ubwo waraje uravuga ngo abashaka kujya kuri cote ya gouvernement n' abashaka kujya kuri cote y' inyenzi , ubwo wowe ubwawe wabonye abantu ababaye benshi bajyiye kuri cote y' inyenzi uterura amarinette umujinya urakwica uvugana na renzaho ibyo mwavuganye simbizi ni wowe ubizi ubwo wahise usohoka uranigendera . ||| We came in very big number believing you sympathized with us . You separated those who wanted to go to the side of Inyenzi and those who wanted to go to the government . Realizing that the number of those who wanted to the Inyenzi 's side was bigger , you became angry and moved your spectacles . You talked to Renzaho . I do not know what you said . Only you know . You even immediately left .
Ubwo bwarakeye ndumva ubwo muri mille collines hari hasigaye abantu bakeya muza muje gutwara abantu muje kwe evacue koko uhageze ntiwatumye hari umugabo numwe ugenda yaragendaga ngo agiye mu nyenzi , urumva ibyo wari uhari ntugire icyo ubeshya ubwo urangije waragendaga ukabwira interahamwe bagakumira abagabo abagore bakaba aribo bagendaga . ||| The following day , I think there were still few people left at Mille Collines . You came for evacuation . When you arrived you did not allow any man to go . When he wanted you said he was going to join Inyenzi . You can see well that we know that you were present . Do not try to tell a single lie . Then after , you went and told the Interahamwe to stop men so that only women might go .
Abo bagendaga basanga babakiraga icyo gihe nabo barabibonye batubera abagabo urumva ? Urangije ubwo ngubwo itariki ya cumi na gatandatu z' ukwa gatandatu ntazibagirwa nibwo baje bamaze gutwara abantu babajyanye muri st paul twe tugumamo aho ngaho uraza uratureba ||| Even those who received them can say it . On June 16th the day I will n't forget , after people had been taken to Saint @-@ Paul and we were staying there , you came and stared at us
urangije urasohoka umaze kugera hanze wagarutse uri kumwe na renzaho na commanda kinyoni na ngelina na conseille wari hariya ngo nimba ari odetta uragenda mujya ahantu wari n' intehamwe yitwa Kimba niyitwa Seseko ubwo wowe uvuga ngo ntabwo wari uhari jye reka wenda nkwibutse ||| Then you went out and came back at once with Renzaho , commander Gisunzu , Angelina , and the then sector councilor called Odette I guess . You went some where . You were with the Interahamwe Kimba and Seseko . Because you are saying that you were not there ; I am just reminding you .
icyo gihe waraje uhagarara hejuru yacu twari munsi y' umukingo nkaha urangije we munyakazi barobanura abantu icyo gihe ndumva abantu barrio basigayemo umugabo witwa Enock abitwa bande , mbese hasigayemo abantu bagera nko mu icumi imbere yo ... imbere yo kwa Amuri muravuganaaa mukanya gatoya ubwo twagiye kubona tubona interahamwe zihagaze hejuru y' ikigo hose zimaze guhagarara hejuru y' ikigo twari hanze turimo kota akazuba ubwo twagiye kumva twumva zirashe urugi rwa st famille ku kiriziya . ||| You came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . Then ... you Munyakazi . They started picking people . Among those left , there was a man called Enock and others . There were still about ten people in front of Amri 's house . You talked and after a while we saw the Interahamwe standing all along the fence . We were outside the church . We were sitting in the sunshine . At once , we heard the Interahamwe shooting at the door of the church .
Abadamu nibo bari barimo nibo basohotse birukanka ubwo nsubiye n' inyuma gato ubwo umupilisi bari bafite witwaga ngo niba ari Yoramu wo ku ruyenzi yaje mu gitondo uwo munsi aratubwira ngo sha ngo akanyu karabaye ngo inyenzi izindi zazijyanye ngo mwebwe mubaye abande ? ||| Women had stayed in . they ran out . Meanwhile , there was a policeman with them called Yoramu or something alike . He was from Ruyenzi . He had arrived in the morning and told us @: "@ you know what ! Today might be your last day !

You came with many Interahamwe . Every man was shot at . We survived by heaven 's will . Only God saved us because no man would have survived . We stayed there till the night . I understand why you say you do not know it ; it is because it did not concern you . I was hiding in grass . There were toilets we had dug .

You came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . Then ... You Munyakazi ... They started picking people . Among those left there was a man called Enock and others .

They used to call him by that name . I told him about a young girl of his family who had come from Mutara . Actually , he was killing us while he himself was being hunted . I do not know what he had been given so to kill ! I asked him @: "@ are you going to shoot at me as you do to others while I saved a girl of your family ? @"

So I have come here @"@ . He asked me @: "@ why have n't stayed on the yard and prefer to join Inyenzi ? @" I said @: "@ I just came here ! @" He asked me with whom I was . I gestured like this and showed him that I was with all of them . He asked me @: "@ why are with all of these Inyenzi ? @"

Bahita bamurasa arirukanka avuga ngo bamubabarire bamubabarire urangije uravuga ngo...ntubizi wajyaga he ||| Then , came another black tall young man in sports suit . His name must be Ntirugiribambe Samuel ; I guess . You were standing nearby . He was brought there . Others were immediately shot at in the very place . You asked @: "@ why are bringing this ? @" they immediately shot at him and he ran away saying @: "@ mercy ! Mercy ! @" on that you said @: "@ taste it ! Why did you come here ? @"

You said that there were others you had taken from the church . You came to us and we were about eight people down the water tank . You were with an Interahamwe . He himself said that at Rugenge . You started designating people telling them to stand up . The Interahamwe beat me with a gun on my back , I fell down and you came to stand by me and wondered @: "@ what hell on earth has this come here for ! @"
Ngo hari igihe batavuze ngo bazajye ku kibuga ? Si wowe wabyivugiye ? ||| "@ Have n't they always been told to stay on the yard ? @" did n't you say it yourself ?

Eeh nagirango mbabwire yuko iriya minota mwatanze kugirango umuntu ababwire ibyabereye kuris t famille na st paul ari mikeya ||| I would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul
Kandi itsindo ry 'ikibazo ariho riri , abantu ndumva baba bafite imformations ziba zitandukanye kuko uko ibintu byari bimeze ntago abantu babibonaga kimwe . ||| Whereas it is the center of the problem . People have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way
Twebwe rero nk' abapadiri bari bashinzwe kureba abantu bari bahungiye kuri st famille no kuris t paul ariko tutiyibagije ko hari abandi bantu bari hanze ||| We , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @:
Ku kibuga cy' amashuri ya st famille abo ngabo bari ku kibuga cya st famille n' abantu bari barahunze imirwano badafite ikibazo cy' interahamwe ||| on Sainte @-@ Famille primary school playground , on Sainte @-@ Famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by Interahamwe
Abari st paul no muri st famille ndetse no mu ntangiro muri cela n' abantu bahungaga ahubwo interahamwe . ||| Those who were at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul even at Cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from Interahamwe
Eeeh twebwe rero , kubera ko abntu bazaga baduhungiraho ntabwo twari tuzi abo bantu abo aribo ngo tuvuge ngo wowe urahunga interamwe eeh wowe nta nterahamwe uhunga ||| Right ! We did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from Interahamwe
Ariko ibyo ngibyo twabikoreraga kubera umutekano wa bose nukuvuga rero yuko ubwacu nk' abapadiri mu ibanga twakoraga inama nimugoroba ||| We did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . That means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings
Kugirango dukusanye ibyo twagiye tubwirwa hirya no hino kigirango tumenye uko dushobora dukomeza kumenya gufasha abantu bari barahahungiye ||| In order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there
No kugirango abantu bari barahahungiye ubwabo bakomeze kubaho mu mutekano muri icyo gihe . ||| As well us to make sure their security is guaranteed during that time
Hanyuma rero inama twakoraga nk' abapadiri ntabwo twabibwiraga abntu bari barahahungiye abo twitabazaga ntitwababwiraga ngo twatabaje kanaka . ||| We did not , however , inform the displaced people over there that we resorted to this person or another
Uwaduhaga information ntabwo twavugaga ngo umuntu yaduhaye information twagirango tubabwire ko informations twabonaga z' ibitero byagombaga kuza muri st paul no muri st famille . ||| We did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against Sainte @-@ Famille
Harimo n' abantu bakoranaga inama nabo , habaga harimo abasaveri , bakaza bakatubwira abti mwitonde ejo cg ejobundi barimo gutegura igitero.ubwo tukabimenya ||| There were even people who held meetings among them . There were Xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack . The information could be got that way
Hanyuma rero kubera ko nkuwo munsi utabaga uzi iziri gukorana n' interahamwe ntawari kubimenya niyo mpamvu twirindaga kugira ibintu dusohora bimenyekana . ||| Since we could not know those who were connected to Interahamwe , we did not reveal anything .
Kuko washoboraga kubisohora ugasnag nibo bagiye kudutanga , nuko nguko rero muri rusange twakoraga . ||| One could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . That is the way it worked
Na munyeshyaka batinyaga kuvuga sinzi impamvu batinya kumuvuga ntabwo yakoze , nta na rimwe yigeze ashaka no kwicisha abo bantu bavuga . ||| I do not even know why people have not evoked Munyeshyaka . Munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . He never intended to betray people .
Ubuhamya bwo , nibyo nababwiraga ngo abantu dufite ukuntu tubyumva kuburyo butandukanye twebwe rero nk' abapadiri , ari muri st paul ari muri st famille ||| That is why I was telling you people understand things in differently . We , as priests either in Sainte @-@ Famille or
Muri st paul hari hashinzwe padiri Celestin ariwe wari uhinzwe izo mpunzi sinzi impamvu batigeze bavuga yuko n' interahamwe naho zahageze zatwaye abantu nabo bapfuye ||| Saint @-@ Paul ... we had appointed Father Celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ Paul . I do n't know why people did not mention that Interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies
Nkuko muri st famille abntu baje bakabatwara bakabica icyo kugirango nagirango mvuge kubyerekeye na munyakazi ||| As they came to Sainte @-@ Famille to take and kill people . This leads me to talking about Munyakazi now
Twebwe mu nama twakoze umuntu witwa munyeshyaka kubera ko yari aziranye n' abasirikare twari twaramushinze kujya adutabariza abajandarume bo kuza kudutabara . ||| Because Munyeshyaka was close to soldiers , we had appointed him to calling gendarmes to come to us for help
Mu biryo bajyaga kuzana inyamirambo na hano muri caritas nabyo twari twarabimushinje kubera kumenyana n' abasirikare bakomeye ||| He was also appointed to going and fetch food from Nyamirambo and CARITAS be cause he was known in high @-@ ranked soldiers
Ibyo ngibyo rero ngiye kubabwira ndababwira n ukuri n' ubuhamya ariko na none ikindi nagirango mbabwire nuko hari abasirikare baje kurinda kuris t famille no kuri st paul ||| What I am telling you is a true testimony . I would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul
Abasirikare twari twitabaje ministiri aloys padiri munyeshyaka akamubwira yuko ibitero byari byaraye bihaje , akmubwira yuko interamwe irmo kuza kwica abantu . ||| We had resorted to Minister Aloys . Munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and Interahamwe were coming to kill people
Niwe wavuze ati tugiye kureba ukuntu twafasha ubwo nyuma yaho jye nakoranye na munyeshyaka twagiye kubona tubona abajandarume baraje . ||| He said he was going to handle the situation . I worked with Munyeshyaka . Then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day .
Hari abajandarume bari ku muryango winjiraga kuri procule kubera yuko abantu bari barahungiye kuri st famille bari mu kiriziya inzugi zo z' inyuma zari zifunze . ||| Gendarmes settled at Procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed .
Kereka nyine ubwo higeze kuza igitero gikomeye noneho rero dusaba kubera yuko interahamwe kubera ko zinjiraga uko zibonye zije gutwara abntu muri st famille ||| Once a very strong attack came to take people from Sainte @-@ Famille and because Interahamwe entered in disorder ,
Twageze naho dusaba tuti abajandarume bahari ngo nizizajya ziza imbunda bajye bazibambura bazisige ku muryango aho binjiriraga , bagiye babikora . ||| We asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance . They did it .
Ariko rero iyo hazaga igitero gikomeye nkuko nigeze kubivuga igitero gikomeye cy' interahamwe nta gihe abo bajandarume bigeze babihagarika . ||| However as I said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks
Byabarushaga ingufu pe ndetse wenda na munyakazi yaza kugera aho avuga ko nawe hari ibyo atashoboye . ||| They were stronger than them till Munyakazi himself some were stronger than him
Aho ngaho wenda tutavuga ngo ntago yadutabaye ahubwo aze kuvuga ati hari aho byageze birandenga kuko bimurenze iyo bitamurenga ntabwo yenda abo bantu bari gupfa . ||| We should not say he did not help us in fact . However , he may say that at a time he could not handle the situation . Unless those people would not have probably died
Na none eeh ndacyakomeza ||| I am still on
Mureke twumvikane ||| Please , listen !
Ndacyakomeza kuko niba dushaka kuvugisha ukuri tujye tuvuga ukuntu ibintu byagenze ||| I still have the floor . If we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things
Reka tuze kumubaza , aradusobanurira mureke twumvikane , aravuga wenda ibyo azi n' undi aravuga ibyo azi , muceceke twumvikane . ||| We shall ask him questions . He will explain . Listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his . Please , stop shouting
Eeh ikindi rero na none nababwira , mu bajandarume bari baraduhaye kugirango barinde abantu harimo bamwe b' umutima mubi bashakaga koko ko abo bantu babica . ||| What I can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed .
Ndetse harimo bamwe byasabye ko babahindura kubera yuko bazaga bakavuga bati turirirwa turinze inyenzi abasirikare bacu barimo gupfira ku rugamba bicwa nazo ? ||| It became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting Inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield
Muri abo ngabo harimo abo twasabye barabaduhindurira ubundi mu ntangiriro babandi babaga bari ku kibuga ngirango murabizi bajyaga kuvoma ubundi bakaza kugurisha n' abantu bari mu kiriziya batashoboraga gusohoka ||| We asked that some might be transferred . You can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out .
Bigeze aho ahubwo za nterahamwe bavugaga zari ziri aho ngaho hafi kuri st famille zaje gushyiraho bariyeri kuko bavugaga ngo barazanira amazi inyenzi ||| After that , the Interahamwe talked about who were at Sainte @-@ Famille set a barrier saying Inyenzi were being given water .
Izo bariyeri rero zimaze kujyaho twiyambaje abajandarume ngo bajye badufasha no kujya bajya kutuzanira amazi barabikoze . ||| After the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . They did it .
Niba hari uhakana ko baba batarabikoze hagire uvuga ibyo baryaga amazi yabitekaga aho yabaga aturutse ibyo aribyo byose ibyo byabayeho ahubwo jye ntbwo twari tukirikumwe ||| If one does not agree , I would ask him to tell us where the water used to cook the food he ate was from . That happened but I was not with you anymore .
Eeh , hanyuma rero ikindi navuga nuko iriya tariki ya cumin a karindwi bavugaga abantu bapfiriye hariya muri st famille jyewe icyo gihe uwo munsi ku itariki ya cumi na gatandatu nari nagiye ||| Another thing is that on the 17th when people died I had already left
Muri paroisse nabagamo yitwa yuhi najyanye numu na major nsanzimfura jean batiste namaze kumutaba za ko ababikira bagiye ababikira ba basomption bagiye kubicira aho bari babasize ndamubwira nti iruke iwanyu bahakore genocide ||| In the parish Yuhi where I lived , I went with Major Nsanzimfura Jean Baptiste after having called him for help that that the Assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . I told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place
Arambwira ati reka tujyende tujye kubazana mbanza no kugira ubwoba nti jye sindenga hariya hepfo arambwira ati ngwino tugende niba uri buze gupfa turapfana . ||| He told me to go and take them . I first feared to go far and he ensured me that if I was to die we would both die .
Nibwo twagiye turajyana , bon ubwo nimugoroba wicyo gihe byaranudafashije kuburyo bumwe kuko guturuka ku giti cy' inyoni kugera kuri st famille ||| So , we went together . Okay ! That evening we were facilitated from Gitikinyoni to Sainte @-@ Famille by one thing ;
Inkotanyi zarimo kurasa amasasu menshi kugirango zibone uko ziza gutwara abntu muri st paul . ||| Inkotanyi were shooting and bombarding a lot in order to come and take people from Saint @-@ Paul .
Ubwo ngubwo twaraje twahageze nka sasita z' ijoro kubera ko imodoka yaje kudupfumukiraho nariko guturukayo ntabwo twagize amahoro kuko baratubwiraga bati ||| We came and arrived around midnight because our tyre deflated . We had never been at ease all along the journey . At any time we could be told @:
Muhite mutaturashisha kuko imodoka yagendaga gahoro bakavuga ngo muhite mutaturashisha ||| "@ Speed up ! We may get shot at @" because the car was slow .
Ubwo tugeze kuri st famille eeh jyewe ndara muri procule nari kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka kubera ko imfunguzo zacaga muri economat zijya muri st paul nari nazibagiwe . ||| Arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille , I spent the night in Procure with Father Munyeshyaka because I had forgotten the keys of the door from the steward 's office to Saint @-@ Paul .
Hanyuma icyo gihe nibwo twumvise igitero hirya muri st paul barasa amasasu menshi ||| Then we heard a lot of bullet shots in Saint @-@ Paul
twumvise amasasu menshi noneho dukeka ko interahamwe zirimo kwica abantu kubera ko bari baravuze ||| We heard a lot of bullet shots and thought that Interahamwe had come to kill people because it had been rumored
Ko abantu bari muri st famille no muri st paul bari basigaye babazana bavuga bti tuzabicire hamwe bitaturuhije.duhita dutekereza rero ko ariho barimo kwica abantu . ||| That people in Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul not killed yet would be killed together without much effort of killers . We immediately thought the latter were killing people .
Hanyuma ndabyibuka ubwo padiri munyeshyaka niwe wabwiye umusirikare witwa murekezi ati telephone kuri minadef ubabwire ko interahamwe zirimo kwica abantu bari basigaye muri st paul . ||| I remember that Father Munyeshyaka told a soldier called Murekezi to call MINADEF and tell them that Interahamwe were killing people left at Saint @-@ Paul
Uwo musirikare yarabikoze ahita amubwira ati ngwino ....... Ati inkotanyi zagezemo ubwo bari bamaze kumenya yuko Atari byo . ||| The soldier did then told him @: "@ Inkotanyi are already there @"@ . They had just known what we thought was wrong .
Hanyuma nashatse kugenda nibwo nababwiye nti nijoro ntabwo wamenya ko bambaye ziriya za anti bar isasu barimukubita , ibyo bavugaga byo nibyo yari yambaye anti bar . ||| I wanted to leave then and I told them that at night one can not recognize that another wears a bulletproof . What they said is true he wore a bulletproof .
Bon , noneho rero icyo gihe bucyeye bwaho kubera ko jyewe nari naraye muri procule babantu nababwiraga bari ku mashuri ya primaire batatinyaga eeh eeh interahamwe . ||| The following morning -@ I had already spent the night in Procure @- The intrepid people I talked about ... I mean Interahamwe
Padiri twagirango uhine amagambo hari n' abandi basigaye ||| Would you be brief father ? There are still other people who want to talk

Ubwo bamaze kuvuga gutyo jyewe nibwo nanyarutse mpita njya kwihisha muri st paul . ||| No sooner had they said so than I quickly ran to hide in Saint @-@ Paul .
Icyo gihe rero nkuko navugaga abo bantu barahapfiriye , bapfiriye mu busitani bwo mu mazu ya bapadiri ||| As I was saying , those people really died in the yard of priests ' buildings .
Hanyuma koko abo bantu bamaze kubica imirambo baje kuyishyira muri fosse yo mu igaraje rya economat generale ||| After they were killed , the bodies were thrown in the grave that was in the steward general 's office garage
Ariko rero sinavuga twumvaga ukuntu barimo kubica jyewe muri icyo gihe n' abandi bari muri st paul twari natwe turimo kwihisha . ||| I can n't say that ... I with others wo were in Saint @-@ Paul only heard they were being killed . We ourselves were hiding
Nyuma rero nimugoroba nka sakumi n' imwe niho generale munyakazi koko yaje kudutwara atujyana muri archeveche . ||| In the afternoon , around 5 p.m. General Munyakazi came to take us . He took us to the archbishop 's palace .

Kandi icyo gihe byaribyo niho twari twamenye yuko iyo mirambo yari ikiri aho ngaho . ||| It was true because we had just known that the bodies were still there .
Baraje koko bakihagera nibwo twavugaga yuko abajandarume bari kurugi kuri st famille aho ngaho abari bahari sinzi niba hari abagihari ariko bahari babisabira imbabazi . ||| They went . As soon as they arrived ... the gendarmes who were at the main entrance ... -@ I do not know whether there are some who are still alive . But in case there are , they should apologize to you
Kubera yuko babujije aba bantu kwinjira kugirango batabona iyo mirambon' amarorerwa bari bakoze . ||| Because they prevented those people from getting in order to cover the scandals that were done @-
Aho ngaho nuko byagenze , niba rero ni byinshi niba hari ibibazo mwambaza jyewe . ||| That is what happened there but the story is longer than that . If there are questions you may ask me .
Padiri , padiri hari akantu gato nshaka kukubaza jyewe , imirambo yajugunywe muri iyo fosse ya economt yarataburuwe iranshyingurwa cg ? ||| I want to ask you one question Father ; the bodies thrown in the garage , have they been exhumed and worthily buried or not yet ?
Imirambo yahamaze iminsi itangiye kunuka baje kubatwara bajy kubashyingura ariko aho bajyiye kubashyingura ||| After some time after the bodies went stinking and people came and went to bury them . But where they were buried ....

Bayivanye muri iyo fosse se barongera barayitwara ? ||| Were they taken from the graves and taken away ?
Bayikuye muri iyo fosse barongera abarayitwara ndetse intambara inarangiye nizo fosse zari zikinuka . ||| They were taken from the graves and taken away ? The graves were still stinking even after war .

Yarampamagaye arantelephona ati ubu jyewe maze kubona imbunda ndagenda njya kumureba hariya kuri st famille ndamubwira nti imbunda wayishyira kurutugu uri padiri ukayitwara ? arambwira ati koko iraremereye . ||| He once phoned me and told me that he had just had a gun . I went and joined him at Sainte @-@ Famille . I asked him whether he could dare bear a gun on his shoulders and walk . He told me that it was of course heavy .
Ati ngiye kwaka pistole , pistole yarayatse arayibona ndagenda ndamubwira nti iyo pistole uzayirashisha umuntu ? yabanje gutebeza akayishyira hano ||| He told me that he was going to ask for a pistol . He asked for it and he got it . I asked him whether he would shoot at person with it . He slipped on his shirt and put it here .
Hanyuma rero ndagenda ndamubwira nti pistole uzayikoresha iki ? arambwira ati jyewe ntabwo nshobora gutinyuka kurasa umuntu ||| Then I told him @: "@ what will you do with a pistol ? @" He answered @: "@ I can not dare kill .
Ati nukugirango interahamwe zimbone zibone yuko ndi uwazo zintinye , ibyo nibyo yambwiraga , noneho ndamubwira nti yishyire imbere ubone gutebeza ntuyerekane . ||| It is just to make the Interahamwe believe that I am one of them and then fear me @"@ . That is what he told me . So , I told him to slip on it but not to reveal it .
Noneho arambwira ati nyishyize imbere se naba narayakiye iki ? Ati nukugirango interahamwe zintinye zimbone kandi zijye zibona ko dufatanije . ||| "@ It would be of no use . @"@ Why would I have asked for it if I slip on it then ? It is just to make the Interahamwe fear me , see me and find in me a partner @" he said .
Nibyo ngibyo ? Murabyemerewe ariko ubundi ? ||| Are you allowed that at least ?
Yego ubundi ntabwo tubyemerewe ntabwo turi abasirikare . ||| Of course we are not . We are not soldiers .

N' icyari kimuzanye ntabwo nakibabwira , jyewe gusa icyo mvuga nasohotse muri procule noneho nsohotse muri procule niho nari naraye nza kumubona aho ngaho nyuma aza kugenda ibindi bisobanuro nanjye naba mbeshye . ||| I do not even know that .

Jyewe ibintu ngiye kubabwira ndibanda ku itari ya cumi n' icyenda z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu 1994 ahantu mwakomeje kuvuga ngo imodoka y' umutuku n' imodoka y' umweru ||| In my speech , I will focus on the date of June 19th 1994 especially about the confusion of the red and white cars .
kuriyo tariki mu gitondo cyaho umugore witwa angelina mukandutiye wari inspectrice w' amashuri muri iyi nyarugenge yaje mu gitondo cyako azana na munyakazi angelina aza avuga ngo udusasu tw' inyenzi twaraye tungwaho kandi twaturukaga hano muri st famille . ||| On that date in the morning , Angelina who was the school inspector in Nyarugenge arrived with Munyakazi . She said that Inyenzi had been shooting at her all along the night and that they were shooting from Sainte @-@ Famille .
Baba binjiye mu kiriziya n' interahamwe zo muri rugenge jye ntabwo nzibuka amazina kuko nakomokaga muri secteur ya cyahafi , ||| They immediately went in the church together with Interahamwe . I do not know their names because I was from Cyahafi sector .
Angelina yanjyezeho aravuga ngo ariko ababtutsi n' urwiri koko ngo nawe mukandutiye uracyariho ? dore ko twari tuziranye rero . ||| Angelina saw me and exclaimed @: "@ Tutsis , you are as hardy as weed . Are you still alive Mukandutiye ? @" She was an acquaintance of mine actually .
Icyakurikiyeho yarambwiye ati jya hariya ujyane n' abandi ubwo bari absore cumi n' umunani bari bamaze kubasohora muri kiriziya nanjye nari uwacumi n' icyenda . ||| Next she told me to join others . They were 18 young men and I was the nineteenth .
Mu buhamya ngiye kubabwira rero nagirango nibutse uyu mugabo munyakazi ko yangiriye neza kuko niwe wankijije ese niba atarahageze yankijije ate ? ||| In my testimony I want to thank this man Munyakazi because he saved me . How would have saved me if he had not arrived then ?
Ubwo nasohokanye nabo basore turagenda tujyeze kuri ya modoka nababwiraga y' umutuku munyakazi yabwiye angelina ati uyu mugore nta cyaha muziho . ||| I went out with the young men . When we reached the red car I was talking about , Munyakazi told Angelina @: "@ I do n't know anything wrong with this woman ! @"
Angelina aramusubiza ati ko twatumwe na renzaho wajeukajya kuvugana na renzaho uyu mugore nta cyah afite . ||| Angelina replied @: "@ We have been sent by Renzaho . Why do n't you come with us and go to tell him that the woman is innocent ? @"
Munyakazi ikintu yahise akora yahise agira gutya ati subira inyuma , nsubira mu kiriziya rwose nyakubahwa warakoze ariko bariya basore ntabwo turamenya irengero ryabo . ||| What Munyakazi did immediately ; he told me @: "@ go back @"@ . I really thank you Sir . However , we would like to know where the young men disappeared .

Ngaho tubwire ||| Tell us now !
Jyew ibyo mvuga ntago ari birebire cyane kuri munyakazi ariko ni bikeya bitewe n' imodoka y' umutuku ari guhakana ||| I will n't say much of Munyakazi . I have come because of the red car he is denying .
Umunsi bapakiramo abantu benshi bavuye st paul barimo uwa mbere ni Bidede uwo munsi wa bideri ni nawo munsi yatwaye abantu benshi inshuro eshatu ||| The day many people among them Bidede were carried from Saint @-@ Paul is the day when he [ Munyakazi ] carried many people among them Bideli in three rounds of time .
Iyo modoka yatwayemo ba bidede aribwo abantu bapfiriye hariya muri secteur rugenge murabizi uko bangana ||| He carried in the car Bidede and others . That is the day when people were killed at Rugenge sector 's office . You remember their number .
Iyo modoka yatwayemo ba bidede inshuro ya mbere , inshuro ya kabiri harimo bande , inshuro ya gatatu harimo bande ? ||| For the first round , he carried Bidede and others . What about the second and the third ?
Ku bwa bidede nibwo mvuga nyine aribwo bwa mbere ariko apakiranye naba basore aribo harimo abana bo ku kacyiru sinibuka amazina yabo , harimo n' abandi bana ba ba nyenyanza , ||| The first round I am talking about there were Bideli and other young men from Kacyiru whose names I do not remember . There were also other guys from Nyanza
Harimo n' abana bo kwa n' umuhungu wo kwa murashi , harimo n' akana kitwa rukinirwa gaciye akaboko , mbega abaguye irya mirambo yose yaguye kuri uwo munsi uturutse ku muhanda wa kaburimbo range ijy hepfo muri rugenge iyo mirambo yose ni kuri uwo munsi bidede yarimo . ||| There were also Murashi 's children from Numuhungu 's place and a one @-@ handed small boy called Rukinirwa . Actually those bodies which were lying there from the tarmacked road down to Rugenge . All those bodies ! For sure Bidede was among them .
kuko impamvu mvuga kuri bidede nuko ariwe babanje kwica bakamutwikisha na essence , ||| I am talking about Bidede because he was the first to be caught , then shot , and finally burnt with oil
Noneho bamanuka bica kurinda kugera hariya munsi y' igipangu cy' inka muri secteur rugenge ||| From there , they went downhill killing people up to the farm in Rugenge sector .
Ariko iyo modoka mukuza kwayo ba ngamije , nagmije ||| When the car reached , people on board included @: Ngamije ,
Ba ngamije , na ndamage , na bikomagu , ari n' umuhungu uva inda imwe naba nyirabagenzi niba ari musaza we simbizi ||| Ndamage , Bikomagu who was Nyirabagenzi 's brother I guess .
Baravuze ngo munyakazi adutume ko dujya gushangurura imyanda iri munsi ya st paul no muri st paul ||| They said that they were sent by Munyakazi in order to take off the shit down Saint @-@ Paul
Ubwo babivuga numva kuko iriya bariyeri yari imbere yo kwa kigega ariyo kwa martini niho baje kuza kuhabika ko munyakazi abatumye gutyo , nari nicaye kuri iriya bar yo kwa bizimana babivuga numva ||| I was listening . The barrier was set in front of Kigega 's and Martin 's houses . They came and said that was the task given to them by Munyakazi . I was sitting in a bar near Bizimana 's house . I was listening .
Ubwo noneho bankoraho ngo ninze njyane n' abandi njye gushwangurira ishyamba iyo myanda tuyikuramo , ndababwira nti jyewe sinjya nshwangurura sinzi gushwangurura ibyo aribyo jyewe niyicarira nari mfite bibiriya mu ntoki ||| They told me to join others and go to cleanse . I told them that I did not understand that language . I sat down again . I was holding a bible .
Barazamuka bajya gushwangurura koko bagiye muri st paul .......... Uwa mbere ni mazimpaka wangeze iruhande arambwira ngo n 'uriya muhungu wa murashi ||| They went up cleansing as they said . They went to Saint @-@ Paul . The first person who approached me is Mazimpaka who asked me about Murashi 's son ...
Arambwira ngo nombona uwi wabo wasigaye nimba nanjye nzaba nkiriho nzababwire aho yaguye ubwo ni hariya imbere yo kwa thomas kandi koko ni mbere yo kwa Thomas yaguye ||| He told me that in case I found one of his family members I would tell him about his death . Of course if would be still alive myself !
Akibivuga gutyo noneho barambwira ngo uramuzi nti ndamuzi , nti yitwa mazimpaka ngo ca hano ujyane nawe uwo ni ndagijimana na ngamije , ||| No sooner had he said it than Ngamije and Ndagijimana asked me whether I knew him . I said that I did , that his name was Mazimpaka . They ordered me @: @" go this way ! follow him @"
Noneho najye ndababwira nti umva rero kujya nawe ntibimbujije ndajyana nawe ngiye kuhahagarara bantera senteri ngwa hirya y' umuhanda nicara aho ngaho ||| Then I told them @: "@ yes I will @"@ . When I wanted to stop they pushed me and I fell on the other side of the road . I sat there .
Batangira gukora ariko rero icyo mvuga nuko munyakazi ahakana iyo modoka imodoka yakoze inshuro ya mbere isubirayo ijya kuzana abandi imodoka yakoze inshuro eshatu ||| They started their task . What I want to say is that though Munyakazi is denying the red car , it went for the first round , went back to carry others . It went three times .
Ku nshuro ya gatatu nibwo bazanye abo bahungu bavuga ababazanye ari cumi na batandatu babicira hariya muri cnd iri munsi ya secteur rugenge ||| For the third round he brought those young men . They were sixteen . They were killed in CND down Rugenge sector 's office .
Ubwo harimo umwana wo kwa mutarambirwa ubwo niwe wavuye asimbuka igipangu iriya nzu iri hariya hepfo amanuka hepfo muri ariya mazu . Ariko byo biranditse muri gacaca y' akagari ||| There was Mutarambirwa 's son who jumped over the fence of the house over there and went downhill through those houses . This is written in the cell gacaca court record .
Nuko ubwo nonehoa bo ngabo nibwo imodoka isubiyeyo iravuga ngo igiye kujyana aba ruguru abo barugu rero ntabwo mbazi ariko iyo modoka nubwo ayikana kandi bavuga ngo munyakazi yadutumyeho ko tugomba kujya gushangurura . ||| The car turned back . They said it was going to bring others up there . I do not those , however . So , denying the car , whereas the people said they were sent by Munyakazi to cleanse , is contradictory .
Kandi mukanya gato nibwo nahise mbona iyo modoka izana abo bantu , ubwo rero yasobanura ukuntu iyo modoka atayizi kandi avuga ko impunzi zari ukubiri hari imodoka ravuganaga na gouvernement yo hanze izo arazizi ||| After a while I saw the same car to the place where we were . He may then explain how he did not it given he said that the displaced people comprised two parts of which one for the government in Sainte @-@ Famille yard . I think he must know them .
Noneho nizo zari zihishe muri iki kigo cya st famille ibyo ngibyo rero ashobora kubisobanura ko ngo imodoka atayizi iyo modoka y' umweru avuga ko yagendagamo yigeze kuyinyuramo ||| Another part @: those who were hiding in Sainte @-@ Famille church . I think he might clarify those things and how he does not know the car ... Actually I once saw him in the white car
Ayimanukamo Hari umuntu yari aje kureba kuri bariyeri yari hariya kuri secteur rugenge umugabo bari kumwe simuzi ahubwo icyo gihe nuko yahise ahura na responsible wo muri rugenge narcisse ||| that he acknowledges . He came to the barrier to see someone . I do know the man who was with him . He immediately met one cell leader from Rugenge ; Narcisse .
Batambikana berekera hirya nkabareba inyanza mu kanya gatoya rero baje kugaruka bakoresha inama hasigara nyirabagenzi arimo avuga ng amabati y' abatutsi ngo ntibongere kuyatemagura ngo bazayarunda runde ngo bajye bayubakisha inzu bo bazigiramo . ||| They went together some steps to Nyanza . I was watching . After some minutes they were back and held a small a meeting . They left Nyirabagenzi there who ordered not to tear Tutsis ' steel sheets anymore but collect them and later be used to build houses to live in ,
Ngo akazaba gasigaye ngo nako muzakihorere ngo muzagatwerere kuri ayo mabati ||| and to grant to the poor survivors some of the steel sheets .
Buracya se wa nkeshimana yaje mu isoko aza gusenya ya mabati y' inzu zo kwa gaston nzabonitegeka noneho atangiye gusenya ndamubwira nti ariko se ko conseille yababwiye yuko mutazongera kuyatemagura ||| The following morning , Mukeshimana 's father came to destroy steel sheets of Nzabonitegeka Gaston 's houses . When he started , I reminded him that the sector councilor had ordered them not to destroy steel sheets .
None nkaba ndeba muayemagura mwebwe muzubakisha iki ? Noneho nibwo yabwiraga umuhungu wa yonasi witwa michel ngo zamuka ngo ubanze umutikure ho gatoya ngo noneho ngo ugaruke uze gutwara ibiti ||| I asked him @: "@ why are you destroying them ? What will you build your own houses with ? @" On that , he ordered Jonas ' son to come and teach me a lesson and go back to carry wood .
Ravliste tubwire uruhare rw' uyu mugabo urangize ibindi tuzabikurikirana . ||| Please Evariste ; tell us about the role of this man first . We shall follow up that after
Uruhare nuko ahakana ko iyo modoka atayizi ariko byose byakomokaga iwe , dore ahangaha niho aha angaha niho yonani umuhungu we yankubise ........... ||| His role is that though he is denying the car , everything was done under his command . Jonas ' son beat me here !
Icyo gihe gihe ngiye kwivuza kwa rutayisire nsanga rutayisire ntawe uhari bamujyanye mu bitaro ngo ivuriro ryabo bari bashize ||| When I went for treatment at Rutayisire 's , I did not find him . He had been taken to the hospital because all other people of his clinic had been all killed
Njya st famille ngezeyo nsanga abo abasaveri navugaga aribo abo bajandarume bo banyereste kuri abo basaveri banyereka aho njya kwivuriza ||| I went to Sainte @-@ Famille ; the gendarmes and Xaverians sled me where I would be treated
Ngiyeyo nabo birabananira noneho nibwo bavugaga bati gira vuba usohokemo muri aka kanya hagiye gukorwa akantu ||| Nurses there could not treat me . Then they told me to go out very quickly because something bad was to take place in a short time .
Ndamanuka njya st famille ndamanuka no hasi aho hasi kuntuza interahamwe zari ziri hasi nizo zamfashe zirirwa zinyicaje aho ngaho ariko byose rero munyakazi natbihakane kuko izo modoka zombi yarazikoresheje . ||| When I went down to Sainte @-@ Famille the Interahamwe there took me and made me sit down there all the day . Munyakazi should not deny because he used the two cars .
Iminota itatu , iminota itatu kutayirenza kuvuga muri make uko ibintu byagenze , nak groupe nini muzandike mutuzanire ubuhamya bwanditse ||| No one should not go beyond three minutes . Be brief . As a group you should write and give us a written testimony .
Muzabuzane mu rukiko tubushyire hamwe niba hari ibindi byinshi by' ubufatanyacyaha ||| You shall Bring the testimony to the tribunal if there are other issues in relation to aiding and abetting .

Na nyakubahwa generale kandi wenda kubera imirimo myinshi agira atazabura umwanya wo kujya kuvuga inyamirambo naho twarabivuze . ||| because the gentleman might have no time to go there due to daily activities .

Please help us .
Kuko twe twari twizeye gupfa kuko twari twizeye ko ari ngombwa twe tugomba gupfa . ||| We knew that we had absolutely to die .
Ku itariki ya munani z' ukwa gatandatu bahuruje umuntu w' umufaransa niba yarakoraga muri croix rouge ntabwo mbyibuka neza ||| On June 8th , they called upon a French who worked may be in Red @-@ Cross , I do not remember well
Aza aje kureba abana ahageze baramurashe , bamurashe abapadiri bahuruje nyakubahwa generale munyakazi araza yinjira aho twari turi ||| He came to see the babies .

Mukaba mubona hano turi kumwe n' abana benshi ko tutabasabye ngo nimudukize mwadufashije mukadukiriza aba bana twebwe mukatureka ko tuzi neza ko ntaho mwaturengana ||| And we have babies . We are not asking you to save us . We know you can go nowhere with us . Pleases save at least our babies ! @"
Yaratubwiye ngo ont va voir , hari ku itariki ya munani icyo gihe ku itariki ya cyenda twirirwa aho ku itariki ya cumi nibwo baje harimo nyakubahwa generale munyakazi baraza abararasa mu madirishya . ||| He told us that he would handle the problem @: @"@ on va voir ! @" it was on 8th . On 9th we spent the day there . On 10th , people among them Munyakazi , came shooting into windows .
Badutera bya byuka mu maso kuburyo abana benshi bahise bahapfira icyo gihe harimo abadamu benshi n' abana bazana imodoka ya daihatsu badupakira nk' upakira imyumbati cg ibishyimbo . ||| They shot tear @-@ gas into us in such a way that some babies died . There were many women and babies . We were then packed like cassavas or beans into a DAIHATSU pickup .

General Munyakazi shot at its tyres and said @: "@ have you come to take off priests ' property ? @"
Noneho hari abntu ntaratangira kwinjira muri iyi modoka mbona abantu bamwe baratangiye baravuga bati njyewe ndi umuhutu baravuga ngo niba uri umuhutu urajya hehe ||| Before I got into the car , I heard some people saying for example @: "@ I am hutu @"@ .

It does not mean that I do n't know what happened at Sainte @-@ Famille . I just want to talk about the attack headed by this very man Munyakazi at Cela
Mu byukuri rero abatutsi bose bose bo mu kiyovu hariya no hakurya kimicanga se no ku muhima baraje birundira hariya ee muri cela . ||| Actually , Tutsis from Kiyovu , Kimicanga and Muhima had all gathered at Cela
Kuko ariho hantu hari hihishe babona bashobora kubaho twrahageze rerpo hariya muri cela tuahamara iminsi igera kuri ine ntimumbaze itariki itariki muzibaze nka munyakazi we wagabagamo ibitero cg winjiyemo ... ||| because it was a place where they thought they could be safe . We arrived and spent four days there . I do n't know the dates . You may ask Munyakazican because he participated in attacks and entered there .
Ee tuhama iminsi nk' ine ariko kumunsi wa kabiri twakoresheje uko dushoboye abasore bari bahari turavuga ngo reka turebe uko dushyiraho uburinzi cg dushyireho ukwirinda twirwanaho mu buryo bw' interahamwe ||| We spent about four days . On the second day , young men who were there , we thought of establishing self @-@ defense system against Interahamwe
Zitashoboaraga kuza kwinjira zinjira uko zibonye kose , eee dushyiraho ako kantu ko kwinjira gakomeye kagizwe n' umuhungu umwe witwaga albertniwe wari shef ||| so that they might not easily invade . The formed self @-@ defense group was made of Albert , the chief ,
Hagakurikiraho uwitwaga gihana , hagakurikiraho umuhungu witwa makombe hagakurikiraho n' abandi ntibuka amazina ||| Gihana , Makombe , and others whose I do not remember names .
Ubwo ako kagurupe twashyizeho tubona n' akantu gakomeye interahamwe ziduteye bwa mbere turazitsinda noneho ubw akabiri ziraterwa ziratsindwa ||| The group was so strong that we beat the first Interahamwe 's attack . At the second time beat them as well .
Noneho tugeze aho tubona nta bwoba dufite akalisti tuakamanika kurukuta , kurukuta rubanza no hirya tumanika akandi mbese ukuntu tuvugana ukuntu tuzajya dukora uburinzi kuburyo nta nugomba kugira ubwoba nyuma ||| We were no longer afraid . We hanged on the entrance wall and the following one the timetable for watching in turns to ensure everybody 's security .
Ubwo rero interahamwe zabonye zimaze gutsindwa kuburyo bukomeye noneho baragenda batabaza ubutegetsi bukuru muziko bwari buyobowe n' uyu mugabo munyakazi kuko niwe waje aziri imbere bigaragara ko ariwe bagiye gutabaza . ||| After being severely defeated , the Interahamwe went to resort to a higher security level . You know well it was headed by the very Munyakazi who even headed the following attack . This shows he had been called upon by them .
Uyu mugabo barazana ari kumwe n' uwitwa renzaho tharcisse , n' uwitwa ngelina , n' abandi ntibuka abantu bose bari hano barabazi kandi barabibuka . ||| When they came , they were with this man , Renzaho Tharcisse , Angelina and many others I do not remember well . People who are here know and remember them .
Ubwo baraje bahutaza ubwo zari interahamwe zigera nko ku gihumbi ngirango , zari interahamwe zifite imbaraga , zifite ibikoresho , zifite imihoro zifite ibintu byose . ||| They came hitting everything . There were about 1000 Interahamwe I guess . They were really strong and armed with machetes ... with everything
Nabari aho ngaho bari batangiye kuzirinda baravuga bati ni hahandi twashize bati nimureke wenda twe kurwanya aba bantu wenda twice abantu ba bagabo gusa ariko abagore barokoke cg se abana . ||| People who were frightened suggested not to fight since if we fought , we would all be killed . Otherwise , in case we did not , women and children would survive .
Nuko twese twegera uwari mukuru wacu albert tujya kuruhande munyakazi uyu nguyu nabo ba renzaho barinjira baca hagati hariya muri cela ngirango murahareba ukuntu hakurikiranye ||| We went and approached our chief aside and let Munyakazi , Renzaho and others get in . they passed through between Cela buildings . You can see the corridor yourself
Baca ku nzu ya mbere itambitse noneho iya kabiri iriho akantu kameze nka ka chapelle abantu bose bari bihishe muri ako kashapelle ||| They went past the first house , reached the second which was seemingly a chapel , where some were hiding .
Abandi bari inyuma ahantu hari amapera noneho baravuga bati abantu mwese muzamuke , munyakzi uyu nguyu niwe wavuze ngo mutangirire haruguru aho ngaho batangira gutema ibihuru kugirango barebe nuwaba yihishe haruguru aho ngaho . ||| Others were in a guava garden . They told all people to come to the upper side . Munyakazi himself gave the order of closing the upper path . They started cutting down the bush on the upper side in order to see who might be hiding there .
Ubwo twese turaterana uwihishe hose hose uwishe wese baramuzamura renzaho tharicisse arivugira ati n' abatutsi gusa noneho nimubarase ||| We gathered . Everyone was taken from the hideaway . Renzaho said @: "@ there are now only Tutsis . Shoot at them @"@ .
Uyu nguyu munyakazi aravuga ngo nibabe boroheje ngo hataba harimo n' abahutu ubwo ubwe abyibuke neza yaravuze ngo aho kubica bose ngo nibabice bakurikije ahantu bagiye baturuka ||| This one said to wait lest there should be hutus among them . I ask him to remember ; he said that instead of being killed together they should be killed according to their residence places .
Abo ku muhima bajye aha , abo ku kimicanga bajye aha , ngo abo mu kiyovu cya ruguru bajye aha nabo mu kiyovu cyino bajye aha ngaha iryo jambo n' uyu mugabo witwa munyakazi warivuze . Ngo babe ariko babica ||| "@ Muhima here , Kimicanga , upper Kiyovu , lower Kiyovu @"@ , he himself pronounced those words . He said that people should be killed . He used those words .

Turavuga ngo twebwe turi abashyitsi twaje duturutse ikibungo noneho nta mpamvu yo kugirango tujye muri aba mushake aho mutwishyirira mwatwica mwadukiza uuh . ||| Renzaho asked @: "@ where do these belong to ? @" we answered @: "@ we are visitors from Kibungo . We do not have reason to enter any of the groups . Integrate us wherever you like . You may kill or save us @"
Ngo ikibungo se ko ntahahari , munyakazi aravuga ngo nimujye aha ngaha tujya aho ngaho uwo nguwo wari shef wacu witwa albert bamwicira aho uwitwa degode , uwitwa Wilson , nabo ni abana b' umugabo wabaga hariya mu kiyovu ||| "@ There is no Kibungo 's group unfortunately ! @" we were answered . Munyakazi told us @: "@ stay here @"@ . Our chief Albert , Degode , Wilson , and children of one man who lived in Kiyovu were killed there .
Abo barabazamukanye noneho nyina wabo arababwira ati noneho niba mushaka kuko babajie se wabo bana umwnaya munini ati niba mushaka se w' abana nimureke muzane ariko muereke kuntwarira abana ||| Because their mother had been interviewed for a long time , she begged to be told to call the father if they wanted him and have her children saved .
Nyina aramanuka ajya aho yari yihishe inyuma y' akabati akimuzana aba ngaba bamujyanana n' abana be babicira aho ngaho nabo ||| The mother went down to call her husband where he was hiding behind a cupboard . No sooner had they arrived than this one and his men took them and killed the whole family there .
Nuko batangira kwica muri ubwo buryo bica abantu kumugaragaro iyica rubozo riteye ubwoba hariya hantu muri cela ||| That one started killing people like that at everyone 's sight with a cruel torture in Cela
Uwitwa .... ... nakomeje kumva barimo kumubaza abantu bagatinya kumuvuga ariko uyu mugabo uyu mugabo uyu nguyu niwe wayoboye igitero hariya hantu muri cela ||| Someone called .... has been asked and did not dare say it but this man in front of you headed the attack at Cela .

Yari ahari atya abantu bose bapfuye ahari atanga aibitekerezo afite imbunda ya pistole mu ntoki n' interahamwe n' abasirikare bakoresheje uko bashoboye ngo baze bice abantu abatutsi ngo babamareho ||| He was fully there ! He watched the death of people , he gave suggestions holding pistol when the Interahamwe were doing their best to exterminate people , Tutsis .

Noneho baravuga ngo noneho babandi bagiye muri za secteur no mu ma serire nimubajyane mujye kubicira ahandi uyu mugabo we ubwe ariwe ubyivugira ||| This very man ordered that the people gathered in sectors and cells be taken away to be killed .
We ubwe munyakazi uko ameze uku nguku yari yambaye ipantaro yayimanuye gutya yaregeje yumva mbese nta n' ikintu cyamukoraho ||| Munyakazi himself , as you see him in front of you , wore his trousers far below the waist , very proudly , believing himself to be the Almighty
Ubwo ngubwo twebwe twari turi aho ngaho abantu bamaze kujya kubicira irya aho bita muri cnd uyu mugabo wambanjirije yavuze ||| They took the people to CND to kill them and we stayed standing there as my colleague has just said .
Bamaze kubajyana no kubicirayo bamaze kubicirayo nibwo yavugaga ngo jyewe na mukuru wanjye nkurikira uwo yaje gutwara muri hilux yaravuze ngo twebwe tujye ku ruhande , ariko mukuru wanjye watwraga imodoka ||| After they took and killed them there , I and one of my elder brothers were told to stand aside . But my oldest brother who was a driver
Na mubyara wanjye bakoranaga kuri iyo modoka baravuga bati uyu renzaho ubwo ari umunyakibungo reka tumuhungireho wenda araza kudukiza ||| and my cousin they worked together thought that because Renzaho was from Kibungo , he would save them . So they went to him .
Nubwo abo ngabo bajya ho ngaho kuri iyi cote hamwe na mukuru wanjye nkurikira twagumye aho ngaho hamwe n' uyu mugabo witwa antoinet baravuga ngo mwebwe nimugende musange ziriya nterahamwe . ||| They went to that side . I and my elder brother stayed with this man . There was also another called Antoinet . They told us @: "@ join those Interahamwe @"@ .
Turagenda duca duca mu muryango wa cela turazamuka haruguru mu buryo bwo kudutanga ariko ubwo Imana iza kuturinda turagenda tugera mu mpunzi zari ziri kuri st famille ||| That was actually a way of delivering us to them . Fortunately , we went through the entrance of Cela , we went and arrived among displaced people at Sainte @-@ Famille .
Twinjiye mu mpunzi zari ziri kuri st famille kubera ko ari jye wagaragaraga cyane wagaragaraga mbese mu bahigwaga jye ninjiye muri st famille nkigeramo bose barahunga ||| When we joined those displaced people who were in Sainte @-@ Famille , they all moved away from me because I was easily remarkable . I mean ... among the wanted .
Ari iz' abahutu zari zihari ari iz' abatutsi zarizihari bose baba bansize mu kibuga jyenyine kugirango baze bantware ||| Both Tutsis and Hutus left me alone on the yard so that I might be caught .
Nuko ndareba ndavuga aho kugirango nicishe abandi reka nigumire aha ngaha hafi noneho baze bantware ndi aha ngaha ||| I thought that instead of betraying others I should stay and be taken from there .
Ubwo hari mu masayine sayine satanu barimo batwra abantu buhoro buhoro ubwo na mukuru wanjye tukiri kumwe ||| It was about 10 or 11 a.m. People were being taken away one after one , slowly by slowly . I was still with my brother .
Ubwo bukeye bwaho kuri liste y' abantu bakoraga uburinzi ni jyewe wari usigayeho abandi bari bapfuye tubibona nk' abanyu bakoraga ubwo burinzi ||| The following day , I was the only one to survive among the security group . Others were killed in my eyes like yours who did such a work .
Noneho uyu araza arabanza yinjira muri st famille ku munsi ukurikiyeho n' interahamwe ziraza zifite ya liste kugirango baze barebe umuntu waba yaracitse ku icumu mu ntuza muri cela ||| The following day , this one came and entered Sainte @-@ Famille church . The Interahamwe also came with the list we had made in Cela in order to find who might be still alive .
Noneho uyu nguyu yinjira nkujyiye kwa padiri n' interahamwe zifite inkota zijejeta amaraso rwose ku mugaragaro n' abantu bose barabirebaga inkota zijejeta n' imihoro mbese ibintu byose byo kwicana bari babifite . ||| This one entered as to go to the priest 's . He was accompanied by Interahamwe who had swords and machetes rubbed with blood . It was in everyone 's sight . They had all necessary tools to kill
Nuko barahamagara , baravuga ngo nyirinkwaya , barabanje bahamagara albert arbert arahari barahamagaraaaa baramubura bahamagara gihana barmubura , bahamagara izina ryanjye ||| They called @: "@ Nyirinkwaya @"@ ... First they called Albert @: "@ is Albert around ? @" He was n't . "@ Gihana ? @" He was n't . Then they called my name
Bati nyirinkwaya ari hehe ? Ndabireba ngavuga nti ni hahandi ndagiye ikote nari nambaye ndaryambura ndita hasi n' isaha nari nambaye mbita hasi mpita mbihereza mukuru wanjye nti ibi ngibi uzabisigarane ubungubu ndagiye . ||| I thought @: @"@ this is my end now . Let me just go @"@ . I put off my coat and my watch ; I gave them to my elder brother so to keep them and I decided to go .
Nuko ku bw' amahirwe umwe aravuga ngo w' interahamwe witwaga faustin aravuga ngo apuu ngo izi nyenzi ngo twarazishe bahamagaye undi muhungu witwa makombe wari unkurikiye ubu ngubu nawe arahari nawe yabibabwira yabaha ubu buhamya ||| Luckily one of the Interahamwe , Faustin , said @: "@ we have absolutely killed all these Inyenzi ! @" they called another who came after me on the list . His name was Makombe . He is also here right now , he can give you his testimony
Bamuhamagara ngirengo ari uwa kane ankurikiye jyewe nari uwa gatatu nawe tugira Imana bavuze ngo aba bantu bose bapfuye turokoka muri ubwo buryo . ||| He was the fourth to be called and I was the third . Because they had just thought we all died , we survived that way .
Ariko uyu mugabo witwa munyakazi uyu nguyu yayoboye ubwicanyi bwabereye muri cela bamuryose abo bantu babamubaze n' amakuru jye niboneye ntya ntya ntya ibintu navuga rero ni byinshi cyane ||| This man Munyakazi , himself , headed the attacks at Cela . He is responsible for the death of those people . Absolutely ! I saw these things with my own eyes . I even have more .
Hari abagabo bavuze rero nkabo ngabo bitwarutabana yari wavuze ngo yishe abantu muri st famille yaraje jyewe ansanga mu kiriziya aho nari nihishe nicaraga ahntu nakwicara abantu bose bakagenda ||| There are men namely Rutabana who said that he killed people at Sainte @-@ Famille .

Nicaye ntya araza afata ku ikoti ryanjye gutya ryo nari namabaye arambwira ngo ninsohoke noneho abantu bose baravuga ngo wa muntu aragiye wa muntu aragiye ||| I was sitting like this . He held the coat I was wearing like this , and told me to go out . All people murmured @: "@ the guy is finished now ! Absolutely ! @"
Kugeza ubwo jyewe nafashe icyemezo nkahaguruka nkajya guteka igikoma aho interahamwe zacaga kugiango zizansange ahntu hagaragara ntiriwe nicisha abndi bantu ||| At that time I decided to go to cook porridge where the Interahamwe often passed so to be caught from a public place instead of betraying others .
Niba yibuka ahntu batekeraga igikoma nijye wagitekaga icyo navuga ndumva ari icyo ngicyo kuri uyu mugabo ||| If he can remember where porridge was cooked , I was the cook . So , ladies and gentlemen , that is what I had to talk about this man . Thank you

She told the cell leader @: "@ I do n't want to see this man when I am back @"@ . I got arrested . There was a soldier who was a friend of mine . He took me back when we arrived at Six @-@ Heures
Amaze kungarura ||| After taking me back ,

Munyakazi and MINUAR were there . They said @: "@ because people have come to join Inyenzi , let 's make a list of those who are joining the government 's side and those on the Inyenzi 's @"@ .
Umuntu ajye yandika izina kandi avuge naho agiye kujya ubwo bakoze ama liste bamwe turanga ndababwira nti ibyo aribyo byose nukugirango bajye babona uko babiba ||| They told us to write our names and the side we wanted to go to . Some refused . I told my colleagues that it probably intended to abduct us .
Tubijyiyemo hari umudamu wumvikanaga na minuar sinzi ukuntu yaciyeho arabibabwira minuar nayo ntiyari ibizi ibyo munyakazi na munyeshyaka barekereje padiri . ||| We committed to solving the problem .

These thought that we wanted to pass through her and MINUAR so it might systematically transport those who wanted to go RPF .
Kuko muri iyo minsi ibiri bari bamaze kunwara nk' inshuro ebyiri abantu twari kumwe bantangira amafranga ||| During the two days I had been abducted twice and people with me had paid for my ransom .
Hari umujandarume umwe wantwaye arambwira ati noneho ngwino tugende nti se sha munjyanye he ? Ngo aho tubajyana se urahayobewe ndavuga nti noneho karabaye ||| One gendarme once took me and told me @: "@ for this time , come @"@ . I asked him @: @"@ where are you taking me brother ? @" He replied @: "@ you already know where you are usually taken @"@ . I thought that was actually my end .
Abantu batanga amafranga rwose benshi bamwe bari aha birangiye ubwo impapuro ziragaruka zivuye muri minuar munyakazi uwo munsi yari yirirwanye na padiri ||| People gave money . Some of them are even here . On that day , the lists arrived back from MINUAR . Munyakazi had been with the Father all the day
Bavugana kuburyo baravugaga bati abantu mubarebe mujye mumenya uko bameze abarebare , padiri mujeni munyeshyaka sinjya menya n' izina rye numva nshaka .......... ||| talking .

Bon nuko noneho bageze aho baravuga bati noneho mukurikize , munyeshyaka abivugana nuyu mugabo ati n' ukureba abantu barebare mukajya mubatandukanya ||| Okay ! Then Father Munyeshyaka with this man said @: "@ follow this order ; separate tall people from others @"@ .
Kuburyo uwo munsi bamaze kuvugana bari birirwanye mu nama padiri yaraje munyeshyaka yambaye anti bar n' imbunda adusomera missa ari kudusomera missa akoze gutya pistole iragwa ||| On that day , they had been holding a meeting all the day . Father Munyeshyaka came wearing a bullet @-@ proof holding a pistol . When he was celebrating the mass and moved like this the pistol fell down .
Iguye nibwo tuvuze tuti se umuntu ujya gusoma ijambo ry 'Imana akaba atangiye kuzana n' imbunda zikubita hasi agiye kuturasira mu kiriziya ||| When it fell down we wondered @: "@ who is this guy reading the word of God with a gun that that has started falling down ! Will n't he shoot at us in the church ? @"
Ubwo ngiye kubona kubw' amahirwe kuko jye nari mpamaze iminsi mike narabuze uko mpagera ubwo minuar iratangira iravuga ngo nugutoranya ama liste bundi bushya bakajya barobanurira ku kibuga cy' umupira . ||| I had been there for few days . I had failed to arrive before . Finally MINUAR said that the lists had to be drawn again and that selection would take place at the football playground
Ariko bakurikiza za alphabet bagiye gukirikiza za alphabet batangiye kujyana ikiciro kimwe bakijyana bakijyana ikabuga ||| according to an alphabetic order . The first section was brought to Kabuga .
Nyuma yaho bongeye guhamagara bati noneho bageze kuri ba Gatete umunani bati ndavuga nti njyewe izina ryanjye ntibazarigeraho vuba kandi bahora bantwara reka njyende nitwe gatete . ||| There were eight Gatete 's on the list . When they reached them , I thought my name will n't be read when I am still alive because I had been abducted from time to time . I decided to answer under the name of Gatete .
Ndagenda njyeze hanze Ubwo nari mfite abana batanu abamushiki wanjye bamaze gupfa n' abanjye uyu mugabo uyu mugabo twari kumwe uwo munsi padiri munyeshyaka nuriya mugore odetta ||| Arrived outside .... By the way ; I had five children , mine and my sister 's , who had just died . I was with this man and the other lady....Odette .
Baravuga bati Munyentwari ntava ntabacike umuntu wise umwana we kagame ibyo bintu murabyumva murabyumva kandi akaba yaranze no gushyingura Rwigema avuga ngo si umwanzi ati ahubwo conseille uyu muntu wawe kuki wamutunze kugeza iki gihe ? ||| They said @: "@ make sure Munyentwali does not escape . Can you imagine someone who called his son Kagame ? Can you imagine that ? He even refused to go to Rwigema 's burial saying he was not an enemy . By the way , you , sector councilor , why have kept such a person till today ? @"
Ku kibuga ndi ku ikamyo barabyanga pe uyu mugabo arabyanga we na padiri induru iravuga minuar niyo yamfashe barandwanira banjyana ku ngufu ||| It was on the playground . I was about to get on the truck . This man and Munyeshyaka refused absolutely . It became a great dispute . Finally , MINUAR took me away by force .
Urumva rero ibyabaye nyuma kuko namaze kugera ikabuga nibwo st famille abasigayemo bose babishe nanjye ngeze ikabuga ubuhamya ntanze nubwo ngubwo ||| Those who stayed at Sainte @-@ Famille were killed after we left . I was at Kabuga . That was my testimony .

They said that I had to stay because I was not on the list . They checked the list and found out that I had a different name . I had my identity card with me . They refused saying that I should wait for my turn and I could be alive till that time .
Bari bamaze kuntwara inshuro zingahe zigera kuri eshanu abantu bose twari kumwe bamaze kungura hari abajandarume bantwara nta nterahamwe yazaga kuntwara nta n' interahamwe yantwaye n' abajandaraume bantwaye . ||| I had already been abducted for five times .

Ku itari ya karindwi twahungiye muri ..... twahamaze iminsi simuvugaho byinshi . ||| On the 7th we escaped to ..... We spent many days there . I will n't say much of him .
Kuko uriya wambanjirije yabivuzeho kandi twarabanaga . ||| My colleague already said it and we were together
No muri ako gakipe twari turi kumwe ko kuba twabasha kwirinda . ||| We were even in the same group
Ariko uyu mugabo igitero cye cyose niwe wadusheshe . ||| but we were dispersed by this man and his men .

Koko hari gupfamo abo yita benewabo . ||| and realized that people of his ethnic group would also die with us in case we were all killed .

Bamwe nibwo babapakiriye aho mu modoka harimo abana bo kwa rwanga bangahe na se . ||| Some were packed into the car . Among those Rwanga and his children .
Ibyo byose bitirirwa uyu mugado kuko niwe wabikoraga aho hantu twaje kuhava . ||| He is responsible for all of that because he did it there . After some time we left the place
Tugenda twitwikiriye za matora bamwe tujya saint famille . ||| covering our heads with mattresses . Some went to Sainte @-@ Famille .
Tugize amahirwa saint famille turinjira ariko ntiyahasibaga ari kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka . ||| Fortunately we arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille . He was always there .
Ikintu rero namwisabiraga ntavuze menshi kuko ibindi babivuze . ||| Because people have already talked about it , I want to be brief and ask him one thing ;
Nabo Bantu cumi n' umunani yanjyanye atwereke aho bahereye cyangwa se niba yaranabishe . ||| to show us the eighteen people he took away or , if he killed them ,
Atwereka amagufa yabo tuyashyingure mucyubahiro ndumva ibyange ari ibyo . ||| to show us their bodies so to worthily bury them . That 's it .

Agahakana iyo modoka y' umutuku yagiyemo akavuga ngo ntabikoresho yahaye interahamwe . ||| and denies that he travelled in the red car , that he supplied the Interahamwe

Bakoresha inama bavugango basenya amazu y' abatutsi ngo abahungu babo babone amabati yo kubakisha . ||| In the meeting , they told people to destroy Tutsis ' houses so that their sons might have steel sheets to cover their houses .

Munyakazi ari mu modoka itukura nubwo avuga ngo nta modoka yagenzemo . ||| Munyakazi was in a red car though he is denying it .
Azana umushoferi wabo wa jandarumori witwa muhirwa . ||| He came with a driver from the gendarmerie called Murindwa
Twari duturanye aza abaza ngo ese ntamyanda y' abatutsi ngo iraha ngaha . ||| who was my neighbor . He arrived asking whether there were not tutsi shit .
Baseka cyane ubona mbese we nabinyuma yiyo modoka ya minitarape . ||| They were laughing . One could see even people in the MINITRAP 's truck boot .
Avamo niho namuboneye avugana na murindwa umushoferi wabo . ||| That is the time when I saw him talking to their driver Murindwa .
Baza kongera iyo modoka barayikiranura baragenda uyu nguyu ayigenda inyuma agenda abaza ngo nta myanda iraha . ||| They turned back the truck . The car of this one followed it . He was asking @: "@ is n't there any shit here ? @"

Aburiza muri icyo kimodoka kuko yari abari inyuma niwe rero kuko niwe uzi aho babajyanye . ||| He told them to get on the truck and he followed them . Only he knows where he carried them .

Nongera kumubona aza kwa murindwa avuga ngo ubanza inyenzi zigiye kutunesha . ||| I saw him again coming to Murindwa 's house . He said @: "@ I think the Inyenzi are beating us now ! @"
Uwo murindwa ariho ? ||| Is Murindwa alive ?
Oya murindwa yarapfuye . ||| No. He is dead !
Sinzi rero impamvu arimo guhakana kandi no mungo yarazaga agakoresha amanama . ||| I can n't imagine why he is defending himself whereas he used to come to people 's homes to hold meetings .

Yari aziko bamaze kwica abantu nuko munyakazi aratubwira ngo muhumure abantu banyu nta kintu babaye . ||| He knew that people were killed and told us @: "@ do not worry , your people are safe @"@ .
Kuko bari babamanukanye mukayira ko muri lycee bagiye kubicira ahandi . ||| They had been taken through one path that goes down from Lycée in order to be killed somewhere else .
Bamubwira ngo nyamara babishe arabwira ngo muhumure ngo nta kintu babaye . ||| They told him @: "@ we know they died @"@ . He replied @: "@ do not worry ! Nothing bad happened to them ! @"@ .
Ngewe rero nkaba nziko bapfuye nkaba namubazaga atubwire iby' urupfu rwabo . ||| I knew that they were dead . So , I would like to ask him to tell us about their death .
Ubuhamya bwange nubwo murakoze . ||| That is all of my testimony .
Tubwire amazina wanganaga iki amazina yawe ? ||| What are your names again ? How old were you ?

Yo nshobora kuyibona ariko umubare wabo ariko icyo gihe bariyandikishaga bari abantu cumi n' umunani . ||| I wonder if I could have it . They were about 18 when getting registered .

Nitwa jean bosco mwiseneza navukiye ahahoze ari muri komini gishoma . ||| My names are Jean Bosco . I was born in former Gishoma commune
Banza utubwire amazina y' ababyeyi bawe data yitwa onesphore . ||| Tell us your parents ' names first .
Ngewe mwiseneza jean bosco ntanze Imana ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri . ||| My father is Onesphore . I , Mwisesneza Jean Bosco , swear to God that what I am going to say is true .
Uyu mugabo nta byinshi muziho ariko namubonye ku itariki ya makumyabiri . ||| I do not know much of this man but I saw him on 20th
Z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu ..... muri saint paul ariko inkotanyi zije gutwara abantu ngira ibyago byo gusigarana n' abandi Bantu bake . ||| June at Saint @-@ Paul . When Inkotanyi came to take people over there I was unlucky to stay there with other few people .
Twakomeje kubamo dusigarana n' umuntu watubereye umuntu ntamenya uko mbivuga . ||| We stayed there with someone whose deeds should be highly exalted !
Witwa reonard yari umuzamu muri saint paul ndibuka ko igihe kimwe interahamwe zigeze kuza gushaka zivuga ngo zirashaka abantu basigayemo . ||| His name was Léonard . He was a watchman at Saint @-@ Paul . I remember that , once Interahamwe attacked saying they wanted people who stayed there ,
Uwo reonard anshyira mucyobo ashyiraho ibyatsi ndavuga nti uyu nguyu ubanza ariwe ugiye kunyiyicira . ||| Léonard put me into a hole . He told me that he thought I would be killed by this one .
Ariko reonard uwo niwe wangiriye neza yari umuzamu abantu benshi baramuzi . ||| I was saved by him . He was a watchman . Many people know him .
Ariko reonard niwe wambwiraga uko bimeze kuko njye ntashoboraga kujya hanze . ||| Léonard could tell me everything because I could not go out .
Bigeze ku itariki ya 20 bavuzeko abajandarume barindaga saint paul batakemerewe gukomeza kuhaguma . ||| On 20th , it was said that gendarmes who guarded Saint @-@ Paul would no longer stay .
Ko bagiye kuhabakura ........ ariko ubwo muri saint paul nari nahashigajwe nuko hari umuntu wari waje angira inama . ||| They would be transferred . By the way , I stayed because someone
Yabaga kuri secteur rugenge yari umwana twari dusanzwe tuziranye . ||| who was a guard at Rugenge sector 's office had advised me not to . We knew each other from early childhood .
Umunsi batwayeho abantu muri saint paul nimugoroba nibwo batuvumbuye aho twari twihishe . ||| We were found where we used to hide the day people were abducted from Saint @-@ Paul .
Ari kumwe n' abandi Bantu ari kumwe nuwitwa ..... mwa mwumvise . ||| He was with ... you have heard of him .
Hanyuma uwo musirikari arambwira ati ntugire aho ujya kuko batanze itegeko ko abantu bavuye muri saint paul bahungiye muri saint famille ejo bazajya kubica . ||| He had told me not to move because an order had been given ; to kill people who shifted from Saint @-@ Paul to Sainte @-@ Famille .
Nagumye aho ngaho iryo joro interahamwe zikajya ziza gusahura aho muri saint paul . ||| I stayed there that night . Interahamwe kept coming to rob in Saint @-@ Paul
Kuko abantu babaga muri saint paul bahavuye biruka bahasiga ibintu . ||| because people had left rushing and lost their stuffs there .
Uko bagiye baza gusahura ibintu buri joro barahansangaga . ||| I was there every single night they came for robbery .
Noneho nza gutwarwa nudutotsi gatoya . ||| Once I went asleep
Bigejeje nko mu ma saa kumi saa kumi nimwe ngiye kumva numva nkanguwe n' urusaku rw' amasasu . ||| and around 4 a.m bullet shots awakened me ;
Kumbi nabo Bantu bicaga bari bari muri saint famille . ||| people of Sainte @-@ Famille were being killed .
Nkuko uwo mujandarume yari yabimbwiye nari ndi muri iriya nzu ikorerwamo ibirori yitwa centre pastorale saint paul . ||| I had already been warned by the gendarme . I was in Saint @-@ Paul center conference room .
Munyakazi rero aho namubonye namubonye inshuro imwe mubuzima nongeye kumubona ubu ngubu . ||| I saw Munyakazi once in my life . This is my second time to see him .
Ubundi najyaga mubona mu modoka nari ntaramwegera . ||| I could only see him in a car . I had never come close to him .
Uwo munsi ku itariki ya makumyabiri interahamwe bamaze kudutegeka kujya muri saint famille . ||| On 20th , when we were ordered by Interahamwe to go to Sainte @-@ Famille ,
Munyakazi yasanze interahamwe zigambitse ku bibuga saint famille . ||| Munyakazi joined the Interahamwe who stationed on Saint @-@ Paul yard .
Hari ahantu hari aka kiosque kera aho hantu hari bariyeri y' interahamwe . ||| There was a barrier set by the Interahamwe near a kiosk that was there .
Nizo zarimo gushaka niho zari zirimo gushaka kumbagira ariko numva umutima urankomeje ndavuga nti uwatakira uyu mugabo . ||| They wanted to kill me there . I felt some courage and thought to beg this man 's help ;
Icyo navuze naravuze nti njyewe murampora iki nti murabuka kujya kurwana n' inyenzi muvuga ziri kicukiro n' ahandi . ||| I said @: "@ I am innocent . You should rather be fighting Inyenzi who are at Kicukiro and elsewhere
Mukaza mwica abahutu benewanyu saint famille uyu mugabo icyo yavuze yaravuze ati niko sha yari mu modoka ntago yigeze ava mu modoka . ||| but not be killing Hutus , your blood , at Sainte @-@ Famille ! @" He said @: "@ watch out guys ! This one was in the car . He never got off ! @"
Arambaza ngo uri umuhutu ndamubwira nti nd'umuhutu arambwira ngo iwanyu nihe ? ||| He asked me @: "@ hey you , are you hutu ? @" I answered @: "@ Yes I am hutu @"@ . He asked again @: "@ where do you come from ? @"
Ntabwo nigeze mubwirako iwacu ari mugishoma kuko nari namenyeko no kuba umuhutu . ||| I did not answer him because I knew that being hutu
Ariko wavukaga mugishoma ....... Niho hahandi urapfa . ||| born of Gishoma deserved death as well .
Naramubwiye nti iwacu ni mukimbogo nti nikimenyimenyi bucyana maritini na bigori bari abantu b' iwacu . ||| "@ I am from Kimbogo ; Bucyana and Bigoli were from our village @"@ .
Ariya makomini gishoma na kimbogo ni amakomini yegeranye cyane . ||| The two communes , Gishoma and Kimbogo were very close to each other
............ ba marume nange ......... saint famille uyu mugabo niwe wavuze ati nibakurekure . ||| I said the two men were my uncles . This man ordered to release me .
Interahamwe zirampera zingeza kuri saint famille . ||| The Interahamwe accompanied me to Sainte @-@ Famille .
Ndavuga nti nimvuga amazina yanjye nkavuga n' iwacu barankurikirana . ||| I thought @: "@ if I reveal my names and origin , I will get killed @"@ .
Ibyo nibwiye byabaye byo nagiye muri saint famille niyita irindi zina niyita niyita ntezirya hagiye haza aba G . ||| What I thought was actually true . I went to Sainte @-@ Famille and took the name of Ntezirya .
Bavuga ko boherejwe n' umukuru wabo ntabwo nigeze menya uwo ariwe . ||| Republican Guards could sometimes come there and say that they were sent by their chief . I never knew who it was .
Ariko najyaga mbona aga gp baza buri munsi muri saint famille ntabwo namenyaga icyabaga kibazanye . ||| I saw the Republican Guards coming to Sainte @-@ Famille but I never knew what they were coming for ;
Ngo icyabaga kibazanye bavugaga ko baje gushaka abantu babaye muri saint paul . ||| they only said they were coming to look for people who had been at Saint @-@ Paul .
Kubw' amahirwe nahoraga imbere ya nyagasani intambra irarangira inkotanyi zihinguka kuri saint famille . ||| I always prayed God . Luckily the Inkotanyi arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille
Ziradukijije ariko icyo nibuka kuri munyakazi nicyo ngicyo . ||| and saved us . That is what I can remember about Munyakazi
Lycee notre dame de citeau itariki mugabo avuze itariki ya mirongo itatu ukwezi kwa kane . ||| Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux @: on April 30th 1994 , the day this man has just evoked .
Igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na kane koko nibyo abasirikari bari hano muri etat major b' interahamwe bagiye muri lycee notre dame de citeau . ||| It is true that extremist soldiers who were in staff headquarters went to Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux
Kuko aribo bari suppose yo kuharinda abasirikari ..... hari batayo yari iri hariya bakuramo abantu nkuko yabivuze bajya kubica ibyo yavuze kuri tariki koko nibyo ababikira bahise baterefona padiri karibushi . ||| because they were supposed to control the area . A battalion was appointed to control the area . What he said , that nuns called Father Karibushi on phone is true as well ;
Bababwira ibyakogo bagize padiri karibushi yaraterefonnye kuko ningewe warindaga cadredral saint paul . ||| They told him what was taking place . Karibushi called me because I controlled the area of Saint @-@ Paul cathedral .
Ariko nyakubahwa ujye utubwira nababa baragiye muri ibyo bitero bakica ||| You should also tell us who participated in those attacks and killed people , Sir !
Nakubwiyeko ari abasirikari bari bavuye hano muri etat majoro n' interahamwe nibo bagiye kuzaana abantu bari bari hano ku itariki ya mirongo itatu y' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| I told you they were soldiers from staff headquarters as well as the Interahamwe . They went to take people who were here on April 30th ,
Mugihumbi kimwe Maganacyenda mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| 1994
Ujye utubwira abo wari uzi n' amazina kuko n' ubuhamya turimo kwakira . ||| You should tell us the names of those you knew because this is testimony .
Ntabwo nabamenya kuko ababikira bavuze yuko babonye abasirikari binjira mukigo cyabo njyewe rero padiri karibushi yaranterefonnye , anterefonnye arambwira ati nubwo muri lycee notre dame Atari muri zone yawe waduha abajandarume bo kugirango baturindire . ||| I can not know them . Nuns said that they saw soldiers entering their house . I was called by Father Karibushi asking to give them gendarmes to protect them though Lycee Notre Dame was not within my area .
Bariya babikira bari muri ...... ko abasirikari batangiye kubatera nkuko kare nabivuze koko navuye k' umuhima . ||| Those nuns were actually attacked by soldiers as I said it . I left Muhima
Nza muri lycee notre dame de citeau kuri iyo tariki mbonana n' ababikira mbashyira abajandarume . ||| to Lycee Notre Dame de Citeaux . On that day , I met the nuns and I gave gendarmes to them
Mbwira kapiteni ...... ngo ahatange abajandarume bo kurinda lycee notre dame de citeau . ||| I ordered Captain ... to appoint gendarmes to protect Lycee Notre Dame de Citeaux .
Arambabajije rero ati abo basirikari babajyanye hehe nizo nterahamwe ntago mpazi . ||| I was just asked where those soldiers and Interahamwe took them . I do n't know .
Kuko baranyitabaje ndabatabara ngirango aho ntacyaha nakoze . ||| They called me for help and I helped them . I guess there is nothing bad in it .
Kubyerekeye igitero cyo muri sela bavuzeko cyabaye ku itariki ya karindwi hari icyatanzwe ku itariki ya karindwi . ||| As far as the attack at Cela is concerned , I think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ?
Uwo yavugaga kubyerekeranye no guhunga igihe yagereye muri sela we yavuzeko yahageze ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| He just said that he arrived at Cela on April 7th .
Igitero rero cyo ku itari makumyabiri nebyiri z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| What about the attack of April 22nd ?
Ibyo bitero koko byarabaye biyoborwa n' interahamwe zitera muri sela ibyo bitero byarabaye abantu barapfa ariko nkuko nahoze mbivuga ntago nigeze nyobora ibitero by' interahamwe . ||| Yes , those attacks at Cela took place and were headed by Interahamwe . That is true but I never headed the Interamwe 's attacks .
Ariko nyakubahwa icyo gitero waracyamvuse cyishe abo Bantu kuri makumyabiri na kabiri z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| Did you hear of that attack of April 22nd which cost lives of people , Sir ?
Abaturage bari bari muri sela bahungiye muri centre saint paul aba ariho tubarindira . ||| People who were at Cela moved to Saint @-@ Paul center and we protected them there .
Uremerako hari abacitse ku icumu bari bari aho muri sela bahungiye muri saint famille mukabarindirayo . ||| Do you agree that there are those who survived at Cela and moved to Saint @-@ Paul where you protected them ?
Ndabyemera ko hari abantu bahungiye muri sela basimbuka inkuta bajya muri centre saint paul ariko ntago bigeze ariko ntago nigeze nyobora kiriya gitero cy' interahamye nicyo nakurengerezaho . ||| Yes I do agree that there were people who escaped from Cela by jumping over walls . However , I did not head that Interahamwe 's attack . That is all I can add .
Ku kibazo abantu bose bibanzeho kiriya modoka y' umutuku . ||| What do I think about the red car all people have been insisting on ?
Ngirango nicyo nanatangiriyemo mbwira abagize urukiko ko iyo modoka ntayigenzemo . ||| I think I even started with it , saying that I never travelled in that car !
Sinigeze nyigendamo rwose iyo modoka rero nkuko babivuga . ||| I never travelled in that car at all as people are saying .
............ hari imodoka y' umutuku wagendagamo ndayihakana iyo modoka koko y' umutuku ntago nigeze nyikoresha . ||| I absolutely reject that I travelled in that red car . Never !
Kereka niba hari umuntu wagendaga avuga ko yitwa koroneli munyakazi ari muri iyo modoka . ||| Maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel Munyakazi !
Ariko ngewe ntabwo nigeze ngenda muri iyo modoka . ||| But I never used it .
Nyakubahwa ko hari abantu bavugako iyo modoka wayigendagamo baravuga ko iyo modoka yabaga iri mubikorwa byo gufasha . ||| Please Sir ; there are people who say you travelled in that car for humanitarian actions . What do you say ?
Mugihe cya jenocide yatwaraga abantu itwawe n' abandi ariko nawe indi . ||| During genocide it was used by others but
Ugendamo . ||| you had yours somewhere not far !
Ntabwo iyo modoka yigeze ijya muri ..... ntabwo iyo modoka nigeze ngenda iruhande rwayo . ||| The car never got to ... I never travelled near it .
Ntago nigeze ngenda muri iyo modoka kubyerekeye ikibazo cyaza groupe zicaga abantu muri kigali . ||| Never ! Concerning the groups that killed people in Kigali ;
Izo groupe zari nyinshi hari interahamwe nkuko twakunze kubivuga uwanyuma aravuze ngo hari abajepe bazaga . ||| they were many . There were Interahamwe as we 've been saying . The last one has just evoked Republican Guards who used to come where he was .
Hari abantu bari muri za intelligence zinyuranye bicaga abantu bayoborwa n' abandi bayobozi . ||| There were even many intelligence agents employed by other authorities .
Ntabwo rero ibyo ngibyo babishyira k' umutwe wa munyakzi . ||| So Munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes !
Mwazabibaza iyo mitwe yicaga abantu ariko ntabwo mwabigereka k' umutwe wa liyetona koroneli munyakazi . ||| You should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel !
Kuko ngewe icyo mwambaza nkabasobanurira ni zone nari nshinzwe iriya ya katedrale ya saint michel . ||| I should be asked about what happened in my area @: Saint @-@ Michel cathedral .
Kandi gisimba arababwira ati abantu bahageze bose nabo nahasanze nta numwe wahapfiriye . ||| Gisimba has even told you that all people who arrived with him and those he found there survived .
Iyo iyo mitwe yinjira muri katedrale saint michel nari kubabwira nti nikanaka na kanaka . ||| Had the groups entered Saint @-@ Michel cathedral , I would tell you their names .
Ariko hariya nkuko nabibwiye urukiko hari compagnie .... Ya nyarugenge iyo mitwe inyuranye yari MRND , SDR za etat majoro . ||| But the other area was controlled by Nyarugenge territory company as I have already told the court . The groups were MRND , CDR under the staff command
Baza gutwara abantu ibyo bigomba kubazwa iyo mitwe yicaga abantu ntabwo nge liyetona koroneli munyakazi nayoboraga iyo mitwe . ||| Who abducted people ? Those groups of killers must be responsible for it . I , Lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi , was not commanding those groups .
Ku kibazo cya saint andre ibyo bamvuze byose barimo kumbeshyera . ||| The accusations about what happened at Saint @-@ André brought against me are all wrong as well .
Muri saint andre .... Kuri saint andre barambeshyera sinigeze ngerayo nageze kwa padiri ..... ndihamwe na major ngirabatware . ||| The accusations are wrong ones . I never arrived there . I only arrived at Fathers ' house . I was with Major Ngirabatware .
Padiri blanshari bakimara kwica aba furere 8 yaterefonnye ngirabatware asaba yuko abafurere ari kumwe nabo i nyamirambo twajya kubazana . ||| After the killing of eight Brothers , Father Blanchal called Ngirabatware asking him that we might go to carry brothers who were with him .
Tukabazana muri katedrale saint michel twagiyeyo igice cyambere turakizana tugishyira muri katedrale saint michel . ||| We first went to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . We then went to carry them . We brought the first group to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral .
Muzabaze padiri blanchal naba furere baba ... dufite . ||| You may ask Father Blanchal and those Brothers .
Igice cya kabiri cyasigaye i nyamirambo nacyo abajandarume basubiyeyo nacyo bajya kukizana aba furere . ||| Gendarmes went to bring the second group that was still at Nyamirambo .
Babazana muri hotel mille colline na katedrale saint michel ngirango ibyo bibazo pere blanshari ngirango mwabimubaza . ||| They brought them to Hotel de Mille Collines and Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . You can ask the question to Father Blanchal .
Nta gitero nigeze nyobora kuri saint michel no kuri paroise yayoboraga . ||| I never headed any attack against Saint @-@ Michel or his parish
Ariko nyakubahwa mu nshingano zanyu zari kurinda cyane cyane abaturage kandi ndabona mwaribanze cyane cyane kuba padiri naba furere . ||| Please sir , remember your duty was to protect the population and I can realize that you mainly concentrated your efforts on priests and brothers .
Abaturage bo mwari mwabaretse ? abaturage bicwaga nukuvuga baziraga ubwoko bwabo . ||| Why did you forget other people who were being killed because of their ethnic group ?
Twakijije abantu benshi ikibitera ubungubu nuwo natwaye mu modoka ashobora kugera hano akabihakana . ||| We actually saved many people . The only problem is that even someone I carried in my car denies it when he arrives here !
Ariko nge abo bapadiri mvuga bose bari muri za corelasiyo ...... kurasa kuri arishoveki . ||| However , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned .
Ndababwirako abapadiri bose bo muri kigali bariho , abapadiri bose n' abafurere bari muri zone yose yo kuri plateau bariho . ||| I am telling you that all priests who were in Kigali are alive . All priests and brothers who were in the area of Plateau are alive
Ntabantu bapfuye kandi bakijijwe na liyetona koroneli munyakazi ariko umuturage naho wamukiza ashobora kuza nkubu ngubu akakubeshyera akavuga ngo nkuko mbese nabibonye . ||| No one died and all were saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi but once you save man and he comes here to accuse you as I have just seen it here .
Nyakubahwa wabonye abantu bafite icyo barimo kuvuga ntago rwose urukiko arirwo rwashyizeho abantu banga gutya nta nubwo tunabazi twebwe . ||| Please sir , you have seen yourself people who have been here to say something . They have not been appointed by the court . We do not even now them .
Ngirango muzi abantu babiri bo muri rugenge gusa ariko noneho ushire impungenge wumve ko urukiko rutashyizeho abantu bo kugushinja . ||| I think you only know two people from Rugenge . However we can ensure you that the witnesses were not appointed by the court in order to accuse you .
Urumva nta nubwo twagenda tubwira abantu ngo urabona ibyo bagiye bavuga n' ibintu bitandukanye . ||| We can not even dictate people what to say . You have seen that they even gave different experiences .
Kandi ni wowe wisabiyeko uzaza gutanga ubuhamya ahangaha nukuvuga ngo warabyisabiye ubuyobozi butumira abantu . ||| In addition , you asked to come and give the testimony on your own initiative and the administration only convened people
Twe twaje nk' urukiko kugirango twakire ubuhamya bwawe ibyo tukubaza rero turashingira kubyo abantu bavuze . ||| We have come just as court agents to listen to your testimony . Our questions are based on what people have said .
...... aho ngaho turagirango tukumare impungenge . ||| We want to ensure you about that .
Hari ibintu byiinshi bakuvugaga byerekeranye n' inama zakorwa dusubiye muri rugenge ubwo ngubwo . ||| There are a lot of things about the meetings you held in Rugenge . So , ...
Inama zakorwaga aho wageraga ku mihanda uti se iyi myanda ko ntayo mbona ugatanga ibikoresho nk' umuntu koko wari uyoboye ufite .... Ufite abajandarume ufite ibi ...... ||| The meetings , going outside and say there was no shit , supplying killers ... can you imagine as an authority having gendarmes under your command ! ...
Kuri icyo kibazo cyo gusenya amazu muri Kigali ngirango nawe iyo urebye aho abajandarume bari barinze katedrale saint michel ntabwo yigeze isenywa . ||| Concerning destroying houses in Kigali , I think you can see it yourself that areas controlled by gendarmes were safe . Saint @-@ Michel cathedral was not destroyed ,
Kuri saint famille ntabwo yigeze isenywa centre saint paul ntabwo yigeze isenywa . ||| Sainte @-@ Famille was not , Saint @-@ Paul was not
Hotel mille colline ntago yashenywe kuvuga ngo nagiye gukoresha inama zo gusenya amazu ntabwo aribyo . ||| Hotel Mille Collines was not as well . Saying I sensitized about destroying houses is just a lie .
Nyakubahwa ntabwo ari uguhana amagambo ntihashenywe ariko icyo tureba n' abantu bagiye bapfa kuko burya umuntu aruta inzu , inzu yo umuntu arongera akubaka indi ariko umuntu we ntabwo agaruka . ||| This is not a debate Sir . The houses in the areas were not destroyed that is true . Let 's consider people who died because man is more than houses . Houses are built but man passes away once for all .
Amazu ntiyashenywe ariko haguye abantu benshi ngirango wumvise amateka ya saint paul na sela . ||| Houses were not destroyed but many people died . You have yourself heard of saint @-@ Paul 's and Cela 's events ,
............ saint paul , saint famille ngirango nawe urabizi ngirango abantu bose barabizi muri sela nuko none se abo bantu mwayoboraga mwashyize hariya mwari mwarahabashyiriye iki ? ||| those of Saint @-@ Paul , Sainte @-@ Famille ... you know it yourself and all people do . Why did you deploy your men there ?
Mwari mwarahabashyiriye se kugirango barinde amazu niba abantu batari bashoboye kurindwa nagirango dusobanurirwe ibyo bintu . ||| Was it to protect houses after having failed to protect people ? I would like you to explain it to us .
Groupe ....... Nayoboraga yari irinze abantu kuri katedrale saint michel niba hari ibibazo byabaye kuri katedrale saint paul , eglise saint famille nakubwiyeko abajandarume bari bahari . ||| The group under my command protected people at Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . You should ask me to explain what happened there if any problem arose at Saint @-@ Paul cathedral or Sainte @-@ Famille church controlled by gendarmes as I told you .
Groupement electorale ya nyarugenge groupement kigali bagiye .... Ingufu n' interahamwe zateraga biriya bigo . ||| Nyarugenge territory company , Kigali formation and Interahamwe attacked the institutions .
Uwavuze urupfu rwa kabera nta hantu nigeze ngira uruhare mu kwica kabera nagirango mbibwire urukiko ntago nigeze ngira uruhare mu kwica kabera . ||| Someone also o evoked Kabera 's death . I did never participate in his killing .
Igitumye ntari navuze kabera nuko ku itariki ya mbere y' ukwezi kwa gatatu igihmbi kimwe maganacyenda mirongo icyenda na gatanu . ||| I did not evoke him before because on March 1st 1995 ,
Bari kuri lycee bari kuri centre paul eglise saint famille ........ na depite rugema aribo bavuze ko nakuye abantu cumi n' abatatu muri camionnette icyo noneho babyandika no............niho nabisomye icyo gihe abanyakibuye bashyiraho komisiyo . ||| he and others were at Saint @-@ Paul ... at Lycée ... Saint @-@ Paul center ... Sainte @-@ Famille church ... with MP Rugema . It was in that time people say I took 13 people and carried them in a pickup . They even published it ; I read it . People from Kibuye even established a commission
Yo kureba ibyo abo bagabo bavuga niho nabibasobanuriye ariko urupfu rwa kabera abamurashe ntabwo ndi mubantu barashe kabera . ||| which had to investigate about those men 's rumors . I already explained it . But I tell you that I am not among people who shot at Kabera .
Abakora ankete bazazikore ngewe ntabwo ndimo . ||| Investigators have to run the enquiries but I was not among the shooters .
Reka duhe ijambo . ||| Let 's go over to ...
Murakoze nyakubahwa perezida banyakubahwa nyangamugayo nzabye ijambo nkumwe mubari muri sela wahahungiye kuva ku itariki ya karindwi . ||| Thank you mister President , thank you all gacaca court panel members . I have asked to speak as one of the people who were at Cela . I arrived there on 7th .
Nitwa kanzayire berenadeta ntabwo ari ubuhamya ntanga ibyo nshaka kuvuga nibyo ngirango umuvandimwe jenerali munyakazi adufashe kugirango dusobanukirwe ||| My names are Kanzayire Bernadette . I am not giving a testimony . I want to have some explanations from our brother General Munyakazi .
Nkuko byavuzwe nange nari muri sela makumyabiri na kabiri haratewe abari bahari bose brahunga bajya saint famille . ||| As it was said , I was at Cela . On 22nd , the place was attacked and all people escaped to Sainte @-@ Famille
Na saint paul aho hose narahabaye ariko kubyo generali munyakazi yavuze ko yari ashinzwe groupe mobile . ||| And Saint @-@ Paul . I lived in all those places . Munyakazi said that he was in charge of the mobile group .
Ariko yanavuzeko yahaye amabwiriza abari bari muri saint famille na saint paul nahandi . ||| He also said gave some orders to gendarmes who were at Sainte @-@ Famille , Saint @-@ Paul and elsewhere .
Bari bari muri compagnie ......... yavuze ko ariwe wahaye amabwiriza yo kurinda abantu kubera yuko umujandarume wari uhashinzwe yari yabaye broque . e Umuturage Nukuvugako bariya aribo bahabwaga amabwiriza ibyo baba barakoze rero ngirango jeneral munyakazi afite uruhare yabigiramo kandi yafashe responsabilite yo kubaha amabwiriza . ||| He said that he gave orders to territory company men because their commander could not be there . e Member of audience This means that those men were just executing orders . I think that General Munyakazi should be responsible for everything they might have done since he had taken the responsibility to gave orders to them .
Ikindi mu makuru yabanje gutanga nta kintu yigeze avuga kuri ibyo bice bya rugenge na muhima ? ||| Furthermore , in his testimony he did not say anything about the areas of Rugenge and Muhima .
Yivuygiye cathedral saint michel na hotel mille colline ......... nkibanza impamvu yari yanze kuvuga saint famille na saint paul na sela . ||| He only talked about Saint @-@ Michel and Hotel de Mille Collines . I have wondered why he has avoided talking about Sainte @-@ Famille , Saint @-@ Paul and Cela .
Abivuze ari uko abaturage babivuze ariko noneho kubijyanye na saint paul yavuzeko yahagiye ariko umupadiri wari uhakuriye wanadufashije cyane ndetse general munyakazi nkaba nabigushimiye cyane kumakuru yaduhaye niba aribyo . ||| He has talked about them after people did . He told us that he went to Saint @-@ Paul . There was a priest who was in charge of the center who helped us a lot . I even thank you , General Munyakazi , if the information we have been provided with is true ;
Ko ariwe wafashije padiri sebisitini kugirango ashobore kudufasha ariko noneho yavuze ko yamufashije gushaka amazi n' ibiribwa . ||| that you facilitated Father Celestin to help us . He said he helped him to get water and food
Ku ma sitoke ya karitasi ariko se nta nicyo yamufashije kubitero byabaye muri saint paul . ||| From CARITAS ' stores . However , why did n't he help him when Saint @-@ Paul was attacked ?
N' uruhare yaba yaragize gufasha uwo mupadiri kuko niwe twabonaga abandi ntabo twabonaga bari bihishe . ||| He should have helped the only priest we could find because others were hiding .
Icyo yaba yaradufashije kandi anatubwire igihe yajyaga muri saint paul muri ibyo byo kuzana ibiribwa niki . ||| He would have helped us more like that . I would also like to ask him to tell us what he did when he went to Saint @-@ Paul @: to get food or whatever ...
Yabaga agiye gukorayo iki ibitero byahabaye n' abantu bahaguye abajandarume bari bahari hari amakuru bamuhaye ? ||| What he went there for ? Did n't he get any information from gendarmes who were there about people who had been killed there ?
Baramutabaje se ko numva hari n' igihe yahaje kandi ari uko bishe abantu ku itariki ya cumi na kane z' ukwagatandatu . ||| He was called for help but I heard that he arrived after people were already killed .
Muri mirongo icyenda na kane batwaye abasore benshi babatoranije mu ma sale aho abantu bari bahungiye . ||| In 1994 , young men were taken from rooms where they had escaped .
Abo basore bagera kuri za mirongo itandatu n' abandi biciwe hariya hafi riyetona koroneli munyakazi ibyo arabizi ko ntacyo yabwiye urukiko . ||| The young men were about 60 . They were killed near the place . Lieutenant @-@ colonel knows it but he did not tell the court .
Ese yabivuzho iki nk' umuntu wari wahaye amabwirirza abo bajndarume?ibindi nyakubahwa perezida namwe nyangamugayo . ||| How did he consider that , as someone who had given orders to gendarmes ? Mister president , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca panel ,
Ngirango byavuzwe igisigaye ngirango n' ubuyobozi , umuyobozi yatanze amabwiriza umuyobozi wa gisirikari . ||| He gave orders as a military authority .
Nubwo ari igice cya gisirikari ariko bafite n' ukuntu bubahiriza amabwiriza y' umuyobozi wa gisirikari . ||| It was an organ of the army and there is a way in which orders have to be executed within a military hierarchy
Yabikozeho iki murakoze nyakubahwa perezida . ||| What did he do mister president ? Thank you !
Ntabwo tuba turi mubyishimo ngo dukome amashyi ahubwo umuntu tumushimira ibyiza bye . ||| Remember that this is not a party so that we rejoice and clap our hands ! We only thank one for his good deeds .
........... abantu benshi bo muri saint paul badapfa ........ kandi ngirango namwe ibyo murabizi . ||| Many people died at Saint @-@ Paul and I think you already know that
........... ufite ubuyobozi ufite nabo uyobora n' ibikoresho wari ubifite n' intwaro zo gukumira abazaga kwica abantu batanabyize kandi mwebwe mwari mufite abantu mwigishije . ||| Remember you were an authority ; you had men , equipment and weapons to stop killers , who by the way , were not as trained as your men
Bazi gukumira ibintu kibyo by' ibitero by' abantu babaturage bahaye imbunda cyane cyane ko utanatubwiye ...... umuturage n' imbunda ibyo nabyo ubikomozeho ubitubwire . ||| as far as preventing such catastrophes and lay people having been accidently armed ! You should also tell us about arming the population by the way !
Ngirango hari za unite nyinshi ngiye kuzisobanura muri ubwo buryo hari etat major ya arme rwandaise yari ifite ...... general aha hirya ahangaha . ||| There were many unities . I am going to pass through them as follows @: Rwandan army staff with generals here and then ;
Hari etat major ya jandarumori ariyo yari mu mugi hari commandement ops commandement operationnel ya kigali . ||| Gendarmerie staff which was in Kigali city ; Kigali operation command ;
Ariko bafite naza............nyinshi ....... Ariko kugirango ngewe nshobore gutabara bariya baturage . ||| There were also .... A lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned ,
Ndwane n' interahamwe mbarwanye ...... ya groupement kigali nayo yagombaga kwambuka ikajya ku kacyiru twanze ko yambuka . ||| this implied fighting against the Interahamwe and taking Kigali formation to Kacyiru . We did not want it to go there
Igasigara hano .... Na cumi na babiri kuri centre saint paul . ||| rather stay here with twelve guards at Saint @-@ Paul
Nyakubahwa reka singuciye mu ijambo ariko nagirango ibyo abajije wabyumvise kubyerekeranye no muri saint paul . ||| Sorry to interrupt sir ! the question was about Saint @-@ Paul attacks
Ibyerekeranye n' inshingano zanyu kuri saint famle ... uko wari umuyobozi mukuri uko washoboraga gukumira ibitero kugirango abasiviri badapfa . ||| and Sainte @-@ Famille . Among your responsibilities as an authority , you had the ability to stop the attacks and save lives of civilians
Bahungiye hariya bazira ubwoko bwabo turagirango uganishe aho ngaho cyane cyane . ||| who had escaped there because of their ethnic groups . We want you to tackle that issue .
Aho niho ngiye kugera nubundi hari abajandarume bagera kuri cumi n' ababiri kuri centre saint paul n' abajandarume cumi na babiri bari kuri saint famille . ||| I am almost on it . There were twelve gendarmes at Saint @-@ Paul and twelve at Sainte @-@ Famille .
Uriya yavuzeko ibitero byo kuri saint paul abantu ko bavagamo kandi abajandarume bahari bari bashinzwe iki ? ||| There is one who said that people were abducted from Saint @-@ Paul in the eyes of gendarmes . What were they doing then ?
Nababwiyeko ari iza .... Zajyaga gufatamo abantu ababikoze aba bafashe muri saint paul cyangwa muri saint famille . ||| I told you that the....entered to abduct people .
Numva mwazababza kugiti cyabo kuko ntago bigeze babwira ngo kanaka na kanaka baje gufatamo abantu . ||| I think that the abductors of people from Saint @-@ Paul and Sainte @-@ Famille should be asked questions on their own because I was never told that such @-@ and @-@ such went to abduct people .
Iyo babikora muri hariya saint michel mwabonyeko aho narindinze nta kibazo nagize . ||| I would know it if they did it at Saint @-@ Michel . You have realized that the areas I controlled never experienced such problems .
Nibajije ukuntu wagiye ....... Kandi wabihakanye wahakanyeko utari uhashinzwe wahageraga ugiye kuhakora ikinshuro nyinshi ? ||| Why did you usually go there while it was not your area ?
Nabwiye urukiko ko mugitondo ku itariki ya makumyabiri nagiye kurie saint paul . ||| I told you that on 20th , in the morning , I went to saint @-@ Paul
Njya na saint famille tujya no kureba umujandarume wacu wapfuye mugitero cyari cyabaye . ||| And Sainte @-@ Famille to see our gendarme who had died during an attack
Kuri centre saint paul ndongera mbabwirako nyuma ya saa ubwo narindi kuri hotel mille colline . ||| At Saint @-@ Paul . I also told you that I went to Saint @-@ Paul center after ... I was at Hotel de Mille Collines .
Abari muri sopetrade ahari sopecya kera ngirango . ||| What about those who were at SOPETRAD , former SOPECY I think ?
Muri sopecya abajandarume bari hari batayo ya mirongo itandatu nimwe ||| There were battalion 61 gendarmes at SOPECYA .
Nta abajandarume bari bahari bari kumwe n' abaturage ............... ||| No gendarmes with villagers there ?
Abajandarume bari bahari bari kumwe n' abaturage kuri bariyeri haruguru ya sopetrade . ||| I mean those who were with villagers on the barrier at SOPETRAD .
Oya nta bajandarume bari bahari kuva kuri sopetrade ukagera uriya muhanda wa puwa ruru . ||| No , there were no gendarmes there from SOPETRAD to Poids Lourd road .
Wari urinzwe na batayo na nyarugenge yose yari irinzwe na batayo ya mirongo itandatu nimwe . ||| This was guarded by battalion 61 .
Nta bajandarume bari bari kuri iriya bariyeri . ||| There were no gendarmes on the barrier at all .

Twanzeko bitinda bikarambirana asabye ijambo gatoya sinzi niba mbere yo gusoza twarimuha ? ||| We do not want to this to be too long and boring . He wants to say something before we close this cession . Can he ?
Ariko katarambiranye turakamuhaye . ||| But he should be very brief .

Igihe biriya byabaga nari riyetona ........... jenocide y' abatutsi yatangiye muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda . ||| when those events broke out , I was lieutenant . The genocide of Tutsis started in 1959 .

Bavuga yuko naba narakoranye na koroneli renzaho akaba aribyo byatumye abantu batangira no kumpimbira ibirego . ||| It was said that I might have worked with Colonel Renzaho . For that reason , they started bringing fake accusations against me .
