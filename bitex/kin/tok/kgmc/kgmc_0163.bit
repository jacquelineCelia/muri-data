My father was called Karinamaryo Peter and my mother was called Mukagasisi Veronica . We were seven in my family but I am the only one who survived . To start with , I know we migrated to Bugesera but that was not our origin . Our origin was Ruhengeri . We migrated in 1959 escaping the Hutu persecutions . When we were young kids , we used to hear our father saying that there used to be a very big forest where they used to live . So he would tell us how it was not very easy for them while they were fleeing . They were lucky they managed to reach Bugesera . He used to tell us ... he was once the chief 's personnel assistant , [ this is what I used to hear him saying when we were young kids ] . So , on their way while coming they asked him , " Hey you ! What 's your name ? @" He replied them , "@ My name is Karinamaryo @" because that was his name . So Habyarimana 's soldiers asked him again , "@ Karinamaryo ? @" meaning ‘ the shrewd one ’ . They went on and said , "@ Can you imagine ? Listen to this guy . So go ahead and show us your shrewdness @"@ .

People used to tell us about those days but for us it was just History , we never thought of something like the genocide we saw would ever happen . Probably in the same way our children will be taking it as History . Later life went on as it used to be . We grew up until the 1990s...in 1992 in Bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the Hutu were burning the Tutsi 's properties . By then we resided in Ntarama , which was out of [ Ntarama ] town . So it started from the side of Ngenda and Gashora because many Hutus resided in those areas . The area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration . It was a place where they used to take all the Tutsis who had migrated . They used to construct houses close to each other ; the Tutsi , neighbouring each other in that area , inhabited almost all houses .

Instead , they started from the side of Mayange and Musenyi . Areas that had many Hutus ‘ Abamere ’ residing there . Some of the Hutus living there were locals and some had there . We were lucky they would just stop in Nyamata and did not reach our village . But we were well informed on what was going on and the people in the attacked areas would flee from their homes to our home village . Life went though it was so tough , we always used to hear rumours of Hutu burning Tutsi properties .

We grew up knowing that Hutus are enemies of Tutsis . In fact , our parents used to tell us , "@ Dear children , Hutu are bad people . Look at the kind of life we are living and yet we used to be rich . We used to own cattle and so many other things but now we are poor , we do not own anything . This is not the life we were meant to live . We are like this just because of the Hutu . @" We did n't have any hope of living with the Hutu in community ; I do n't know why maybe it was due to what every Government that was in power subjected us to . We could hardly believe it would one day come to an end .

We were at home on the 7th of April 1994 . At night we heard that the President 's helicopter had crashed . My brother came in screaming , "@ We are all dead . I heard that Habyarimana is dead . @" I was still very young ; I was n't mature enough to understand issues concerning the war . I carelessly said , " Oh , if he is dead then we are finally going to get some peace . @" He replied to me , "@ Those are your wishes . All I can assure you is we are going to die . @" We kind of joked about it . The following day came but we did n't have any problems until the night fell . The next day we started hearing terrible rumours of houses being burnt here and there . I think it was four days after the death of Habyarimana that the Tutsis living in Nyamata started fleeing ; you would hear people saying , "@ Listen ! Things are getting worse here ! We have met people fleeing their homes . @" I wondered why but I heard some people saying that because of the plane crash and Habyarimana 's death , there is no way there could be peace in the country .

To us it seemed like the war had started . But in reality , it had only started in Nyamata , Kayumba and on the side of Maranyundo . Ntarama , my home village , was only attacked later on , compared to the other villages in that area . People from Nyamata were fleeing to the families in Ntarama because perpetrators had not yet reached there ; I mean the strong perpetrators . It was only the Hutu perpetrators in the neighbourhood that were killing then . People started fleeing and hiding in churches as it used to be in 1992 expecting it to be the same . On their way they would meet others fleeing from the same place . Some would change their direction and go back with them , while others would ask , “ Where are you going ? ” The other group would reply , “ It 's hell there . We are fleeing . They have burnt the whole area . ” Therefore , some would go back while other would go ahead .

They would accuse each other to be cowards . Some would go to Nyamata while others were coming to Ntarama . And things went on like that for a while . In Nyamata , things were getting worse as days went by . The Nyamata church witnessed horrible shootings and killings . The survivors ran back to where they had come from . All the people [ Tutsi ] in Nyamata and other areashad been killed . Therefore , they started attacking the remaining areas .

By then several people had reached at home because ; we lived well somewhere like ... as one could be living over there ... it is a place called Kayenzi ; when you are crossing towards Nyamata . By then they had n't attacked us ; they could just pass by crossing over to Nyamata . So they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there . They decided to try there . My uncles and aunts with other neighbours were living across the valley so they came and scattered themselves in the neighbouring houses . They would spend one or two days then things would worsen again . One day , I do n't remember which day but it had been two weeks since we were in that situation and the Interahamwe [ perpetrators ] had finished all people in Nyamata . They had killed people in Kayumba forest and killed everyone who was in church . They had killed everywhere else and the next place was my home village . I remember some people saying , "@ The attackers have come through the coffee plantation @"@ , which was slightly below our home . So I was wondering , I could n't imagine things such as killings , I though they were impossible . People were screaming , "@ They have come . @" And then they took off to the Ntarama church through the forest . Those who were still able to defend themselves with bows and spears fought them . At times they were able to defeat the Interahamwe and they would get a rest and go back home . The Interahamwe realized that they were not going to defeat the resistors with no guns . They said there were certainly ‘ Inyenzi ’ among them [ the resistors ] . While fleeing , the resistors used to try and fight back the Interahamwe but they started loosing courage as they were seeing about ten , twenty of them being killed , they started scattering . The strong guys fled towards Gitarama and Kabwayi , there remained very few and helpless people .

He came home and told us [ that is when we were still alive ] , "@ Now things are really bad . We are defeated . We can not defend ourselves anymore and they have killed most of us . @" He told us , "@ They have killed so and so and so and so , who were the strongest men amongst us . @" He went on and said , " Everyone should now find his own way . @" He said so while preparing to live . Then , I asked him , "@ Where are you going now ? @" He replied , "@ We are going to look for a safer place where to take refuge . @" I again asked , "@ Will you not be killed there ? @" He said he did n't know . He went on and said " Bye for now . If I happen to die ... and if I survive we shall meet again . @" That was the last words we heard from him . So he walked away and left us . Things had started getting worse on our side . We used to be comforted by the fact that they would fight them back but they had now left us all . At around the 10th or so everyone was minding his or her own life The day when all people went out of their homes , a group of attackers came from the coffee plantation that was in the valley below our home and everybody was gone . I was the only one left there . Thinking I could not die , I decided to stay there . And then my mum called me and told me that we were not going to die there alone that we should leave . However , some elderly men and women who were not capable of fleeing decided to stay and be killed there .

Then we heard the perpetrators in our cattle we had left home . They hacked them and the people we left home . I heard them hacking them [ the elderly people they had left home ] . We hid in a bush near home because they were already coming near us . First they hacked the men and meanwhile , we run to the sector 's offices at the Ntarama church . But even as we were running , we heard some of them behind us saying , "@ They passed here . There they are . @" And others entered the bush to search for us but luckily they found properties such as suitcases , bags and many others that people had hidden there . We heard them telling each other , "@ Hey ! I discovered some treasures here . @" So as they were concentrating on what they found we found a way to the sector in Ntarama at the church and that 's how we managed to survive that day . In fact , that was the day the war in Nyamata toughened because all the survivors fled to the schools . That is the day they killed my mum and dad and all the people who had hid home . They killed around 20 people . We preceded to the sector . When we reached at the sector ... at the school ... sorry , at Ntarama church .

It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and it was getting dark . People were coming and going . Some were saying they were going to Kigali but they still would be killed on their way and the ones who had managed to survive would come back . Others went to the Ntarama church because there were some people who had been able to survive there for some days . In general , things were so scary . So I told my older sister whom we had run together , " Let 's not spend the night here , it does n't look safe here . How can we sleep here ? @" And then some policemen came and called some of the people who were there . They asked the people there , "@ What is the noise all about and why are you fleeing ? @" They replied , " We are fleeing from the Hutu . They want to kill us . @" Then the policemen said , "@ Calm down , it is over now . Gather up in one place there in the church so that we ensure your security . @"

You will see if those who will spend the night here will survive until tomorrow . I told her , "@ Let us go to the schools , we immediately left and went to the schools . Just after we left , they threw grenades at the Ntarama church . They killed everybody ; the survivors are handicapped today . Anyway , we continued and went to the school . At that time , the only safe hide out was at the school . For those who managed to survive Nyamata or anywhere else in the whole of Bugesera , the only hideout was at the school .

We used to spend the night there , and during the day we would go loitering in the swamps but we had never slept there because the Interahamwe used to go home at around 4 o'clock and we would go behind them and go back to the school .

It was on the 15th of April 1994 . The group of attackers came in many buses . Sometimes they used to come and when they were pushed back , they would go back saying that the Inyenzi were in the swamp and that they had guns . Actually two of Habyarimana 's soldiers [ the Presidential Guard ] had come to kill us and two of the resistors took their guns and used them to defend themselves . Whenever the Interahamwe came towards the swamp they would hear the guns and then they would say there are Inyenzi in the swamps . So they went and called for the buses . You remember the attack of Nyanza ? The buses , which came are the one that came to kill in Bugesera . That was the day I was hacked . When those buses reached Nyanza , they found that they [ the other Interahamwe ] were killing people . Therefore they said , " Keep on finishing the ones ; we are going to reinforce the Bugesera people . The buses came straight to the school building where we were hiding , they really killed many people only few were left . But for us who were near the swamp , that is where they found us . Some old people committed suicide saying that they survived the machetes of 1959 and that the machetes of 1994 could not kill them . They dived into the water and were taken away . People who committed suicide were more than those who were hacked . Others said , "@ Let us die like men . Committing suicide is a sin @"@ . One would say , "@ lets me go and hide . @"

Even my cousin who was slightly older than me . But we were not hiding together ; I do n't know where she was hiding just near by , we also lost her . I found out that they hacked me ; I did not know when I was hacked . But I guess I was hacked at around 4 o'clock or ehh ... at around mid @-@ day . That is when they hacked me . Then I touched myself and saw blood . In my heart , I was wondering if it was possible that they had cut me and I was still alive . I always used to imagine how they would one day bring a machete and hack me . I did not know how I would react . They hacked me on the exact day I had thought about it . I was n't sure I should hide in a sorghum plantation . I just kept on running .

I finally left that bush at around 6.00 o'clock in the evening when the perpetrators were gone and the villagers going home . Maybe it was when fresh air [ the wind ] blew on me that I gained back my consciousness and heard people moving around . Unknowingly , I started calling . But maybe those people thought that I was with perpetrators . Instead of coming close to see , they ran away . And a certain person came and said , "@ Oh no , Mudahogora has been hacked look at how she is hurt ! @" At that time people were running for his or her own life .

When I opened my eyes , I saw the child seated besides me . But he was not hurt at all . Actually they did nothing to him although he later on died . I was the only one who had remained with him but I could n't help him to get something to eat . He developed anemia and died ; he was sitting with eyes wide open just besides me . I watched him for a while , wondering what would happen to him . By chance , a merciful woman who lived in that area came and put him on her back and carried him away .

No one could bother to carry me out of there . I tried both legs and found that I had some little strength left in them but they were injured . I knew when the wounds are still fresh ; it was possible to move around . The only risk was that I could suddenly fall due to over bleeding . So I tried walking and it worked . You can guess that by then , the pain had not started yet so I started running following them . I was avoiding to be left in the bush alone , so I took off . The people I was meeting were wondering how far I would be able to run .

The rest had been killed...my third brother as well . So at the school there were still some survivors .

When the war became tough , those people went to help their fellow Hutu and left their houses covered with banana leaves on the doors . So that when perpetrators came they would not destroy those houses . Then my uncle said that they should carry me to one house of their houses [ belonging to the Hutu ] where there was a banana leaf on the door , no one would enter there . He said God would take care of the rest . That is how it happened ; they took me there and the rest of the people in the school had all left and went to hide in those houses that were still remaining [ the houses with banana leaves ] .

They used to hide during the day in the swamp , and in the evening , after the Interahamwe 's leaving , my borther would bring me some sweet potatoes in a small bucket . But he would go back after because he never used to sleep in those houses . He used to sleep in another place called Bitera . After a few days , they left and never came back .

Then I started wondering if maybe the people who used hide in that house saw the Interahamwe entering the house . In fact , when the Inkotanyi troops came , they first passed into the swamp and told them to cross over to Nyamata . That was the reason why they never came back to those houses . They immediately went where they were told to go . As they were living , they told the Inkotanyi that they were some of their people who are terribly injured but still alive .

"@ Nobody is remaining in this sector . Even the Interahamwe are running way . @" She assured me . Then I told her that I was not able to join them . She suggested to help me walk up to the road . "@ The Inkotanyi will never see you if you remain here @"@ , she said . It was in the evening beginning to get dark ; it was some minutes passed six p.m. Then she said , "@ I guess they will n't come at this time because it is late , but they may come in the morning . Make sure they find you there . @" Then she helped me walk up to a certain house . In that house I found several other kids , who were in the worst condition compared to me ; some were dying , others did n't have legs and could n't move . Others had started rotting from there . In brief , when I reached there , I seemed to be the strongest around . Yet I too was already desperate that my arms had started rotting ; they were weak , I could n't lift an arm to any angle . It took us about ... about four hours to get there . Then we heard people walking around , asking if there could be anybody inside the house . They hit the door and came in . They first saw me because I was the only one who was in better conditions than the others because my legs had not been hacked . Others were horribly injured . Some were hacked around the neck , on the legs , on the head and the arms as well . Two of them were dying due to weeks of hunger and thirst , since those dead bodies lying around . Then he asked if there was anybody who could try and join others . But later he realized that no one was able to walk . Then he asked me if I could try and walk but I said , "@ no I can n't @"@ . And then he sent that lady to Nyamata to bring some people and stretchers to carry us . But when she left , she did not come back . She was afraid of her husband ; he was a Hutu and a perpetrator . Actually she was praying she would find a way to join her people , she did not have anywhere to pass .

They were meant to help the people who were in the swamp , people were asking for water , but I was not of any help to them . The following day they fortunately came to rescue us starting from the badly hurt ones . They went picking up all the casualties , they gathered all of us and divided us into different groups according to our condition . They then carried us at Nyamata hospital where they were taking all casualties . When I arrived there at Nyamata , we found life had changed . You could not recognize anyone ; the only person I knew was my brother but he also later on joined the army . When Inkotanyi reached Nyamata all young men joined the army .

Then after two months we got well and I continued to live in Nyamata . So many people were passing by but I could not find any of my relatives , all my aunts who were there had been killed . I started thinking of what to do , and where to go . There was one lady I used to know , she was still with her mother and brother , and then she invited me to stay with her and said that they will see how things would turn out .

I really needed to know news from my brother but found from people that he had joined the army because he was told that I was dead . But my aunt was also living there , my older sister used to live with her . She died before the war , and we all went to Rwampara to mourn her . The whole family came to bury Katumba , I was with my brother , but he went back and I stayed there . I went on Tuesday and the President died on Wednesday . I had just spent one night then the war started . The whole family was there , waiting to end the mourning ... So I decide to come to Kigali to see if there could be any survivor I can see since in Bugesera there was none . There was one man who had come from Bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at Rwampara , I found that one of my aunts was still there . That is when I started gaining some hope since at least I was getting someone to stay with .

She was surprised to see me and although she saw how I had changed , she was happy that at least I was still alive . She asked me if there could be anybody else who survived and I told her that there was none . The time the Inkotanyi saved us . One of the soldiers said , "@ The Hutu do not really have any sham ; how could they dare hack a halfcaste person ! @" He said that after seeing how I was looking like ; my hair was overgrown . He could n't believe how they dare such crime . So I lived with my aunt who had a daughter . Her grandson who is a soldier later on came with his wife and we all stayed together . Then I went to live in Kacyiru together with my cousin 's spouse ; we met by chance and she told me that she did not know anyone in the family had survived and she could not continue to live alone . She asked me to go and live with her . At that time , people used to make decision at the spur of the moment . We went together but she got sick and died after some time . I then went back to Kimihurura to live with my aunt ; we later on shifted in the neighbourhood of ‘ Chez Lando ’ restaurant where she owned her own house . After sometime she also died and life went on ... I went to AVEGA and asked them for a house to live in , and I was lucky they gave me one . There were some children who were my relatives I brought in and we continued to live together up to now , that is how I am living .

I spent most of my time at the hospital treating this hand as it was still paining me . Dr Nyaruhirira was on an attachment in South Africa . He came back and he is the one who treated me and I got well . Later on , I tried to run after the organization ‘ Kanyarwanda ’ , they were the ones who had taken me there and I was operated ; they changed the position of my arm bone it was not shaped like this . Then later on , those children had no one to look after them , so that is why I did not go back to school .

Wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation . Maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing . But in general , there is a big difference . Life nowadays is not the same as that before the war .

Sincerely , you can not discuss genocide problems ... that problem ... a problem you share with someone else , you can not talk about it with someone you do n't share it . There are those you fell free with because you have the same problems , but ... for example @: the way I tell it to a survivor who was here in Rwanda is not the same as the way I tell it to a person who came from exile . I can tell my story to a survivor because I know we have something in common . It is like talking to someone you do n't share the same language , it is never the same as talking to that one you have it in common...this is just an example .

How can one reconcile with a person who ... well , since there is no alternative , if he comes to you and ask for forgiveness you may forgive him . It is the same as those who say that , in Gacaca courts people admit their crimes and then are forgiven . But do you think they say it from the bottom of their hearts or is it so they may be forgiven ? That is why for me unity and reconciliation is impossible .

That is the time people started joining Inkotanyi . I forgot to tell you that my brother had wanted to join the RPF , they caught him while he was in Ngenda and put him in prison after seriously striking him . For them joining the Inkotanyi was a big mistake and that would make them harass the families [ of the young people who would try to or manage to join the RPF ] .

In our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by Tutsi , there was no Hutu among them . So these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things . Despite that , the genocide was later on generalized .

Mais après on se disait @: « Tant pis s'ils me tuent mais je ne serai pas membre de leur parti . » Tout ceci créait un mauvais vent . C'était ça le multipartisme , tous les partis étaient en conflit . It was similar everywhere . Those who were n't MRND members were persecuted but that did not stop us from being members of the parties we chose . Even though there was so much tension , we were not going to pretend and be where we hated to be . Our attitude was @: "@ If they are going to kill me because that , let it be so . @" There was a lot of tension .

Wowe ibintu...hari ibintu noneho bihari by' uko bagomba gufungura abantu ; abantu kuko bireze bakemera icyaha , bakazaza noneho muri societé bakabasha kongera kubana n' abandi . Icyo kintu ugitekerezaho iki ? Ese ubona ari ikintu kizadufasha kugira ngo tugere ku bumwe n' ubwiyunge ? ||| Going back to just after the genocide ... What do you think of the new program that releases prisoners who acknowledge their crimes and that reintegrates them in the society ? Do you think it will help in the process of unity and reconciliation ?
Njyewe icyo kintu iyo ngitekereje numva kitazashoboka , ahubwo kizatuviramo ibindi bintu bibi , sinzi niba ngewe uko mbyumva ari ko n' abandi babyumva . Kuko n' iyo babivuze mpita urumeza runjeho nkahita numva shwi...kugira ngo umuntu azavuge ngo @: "@ umuntu ngo @: naze ngo @: mwegerane ... @" uzi neza ko yakwiciye , yarishe n' undi muntu uzi ! Numva ari ibintu bizafata intera ndende . ||| When I think about that I find that it impossible . I think it will result into something worse . I do n't know if my opinion is similar to what others think . When I hear that I have goose pimples all over my body ; so I try to ignore it . Can you imagine someone who has killed your people coming to live with you ? Do you think it will be safe ?
Watubwiye ko papa wawe yaturutse mu Ruhengeri . Bari baturanye na mama wawe cyangwa mama wawe yavuye ahandi ... ? ||| You told us that your dad was from Ruhengeri . Were they neighbours with your mum or your mum came from a different place ?
Bari ba...bavaga hamwe . Bose mbese bari batuye hamwe , urabona abantu bari batuye ... bariya bantu bari batuye i Bugesera hariya i Ntarama hafi ya bose . Bose ni abantu bari muri famille imwe , mbese bari mu muryango umwe , baje i Ntarama ... uko baje niko bagiye baturana . ||| They were all living together . In fact all the people of Ntarama were somehow related , they came together and lived together that way .
Icyo gihe bari barashyingiranye ? ||| Did they intermarry ?
Icyo gihe bari barashyingiranywe . Baje bafite umwana w' umusore . ||| Yes , they came when they were grown @-@ ups .
Nagira ngo nkubaze , waba uzi uko babishe ? ||| Do you know how they were killed ?
Yego ndabizi . Ndabizi kandi nabivuze...nigeze kubikomozaho kuko twari kumwe mu rugo baravuga ngo @: "@ tubareke twe gupfa nk' abatagira amaguru . Ngo tubareke bo mbese bagire ... @" Babiciye mu rugo iwacu . Twabaye tugitirimuka gatoya , Interahamwe zihita ziza , babatemagura twumva . ||| Yes of course , I think I 've told you about it ... I partially said it . We were together at home and they told us to escape and leave them behind . They did not want us to die as handicapped people ... They wanted to stay...as soon as we left , the perpetrators came and started killing . We even heard them screaming from where we were .
Abavandimwe bawe bo ntawasigaye ? ||| Did any of your brothers or sisters survive ?
Hari basaza banjye babiri baguye i Kabgayi , uwundi yaguye mu gisirikare , umwe twari twarasigaranye...twari twarasigaranye turi babiri . Undi yapfuye nyuma y' itambara . Ya ntambara ya kongo igihe itera , twabonanye nk' ishuro ebyiri gusa nyuma yaho , aje ngo aje kundeba ahita akora accident arapfa . Abandi rero bose bagendaga bagiye kwihisha nk' abandi bose bakabatemagurira aho ngaho . ||| I lost two brothers in Kabgayi . Another one died at the front line and I remained with one ... We were two to survive . He died in the war in Congo . We had only seen each other twice . He was coming to see me when he died . He died straight away . The others were killed while looking for a place where to hide like everyone else . They were hacked to death .
Ese ntabwo washoboye gushyingura mu cyubahiro abawe i Ntarama ? ||| Did you manage to exhume and rebury your people in Ntarama ?
Nta n' umwe nashyinguye yo kuko biriya bintu byo gushyingura byabaye ndi ino aha ngaha . Kubera ko nari nizeye ko...mbese bari iwacu , bari mu nzu , ariho babiciye . Ngenda ngiye kubitegura nsanga , igihe bavugaga ngo bagiye gushyingura i Nyamata ... igihe ba...ni intuze ni muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] ahari . Igihe bajya I Ntarama mubyo gushyingira . Ngiye ngiye kureba mbarebye ndababura ngo barababwiye ngo @: "@ barababwiye ngo bakusanye abantu bose ngo babashyire hamwe n' abandi hamwe i Ntarama ... ||| I have never been there . The day they were burying them I was here . I knew my parents ' bodies were at home . I went there once to bury them and I was so surprised...it had been announced on the radio , it was in 1995 that people had gone to Ntarama for burials ... When I went to bury them , I did not find them there . People told me they had been told to gather all bodies and to put them together at Ntarama ...
