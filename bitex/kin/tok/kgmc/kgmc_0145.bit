I was born in Kibuye in a district , which was called Mabaza in sector called Rubengera , in Kibagiro cell . I am 21 years old . Well about the testimony of my life before the war , I was with my parents , my relatives , and my family at large . Then time came for me to start studying . The war started while I was in primary four and from then , we started having hardships in our studies . We would be asked about our ethics , they would come and say , "@ Tutsis stand there and Hutus stand here . @" But on my side , I never knew any thing . I remember sometimes they would ask me and I would tell them that , "@ my family belongs to Abanyiginya ... @" [ a clan ] I could n't understand what they meant . But my teacher knew my dad , so he would go and ask my father and then he would know it from there . Otherwise , all the time he asked me , I never used to reply him a single word . Because in my home , they never used to brief us about where to stand in case they asked for Tutsi or Hutus to stand @-@ up . Therefore , things continued like that and it never took long , I shifted from the first class to the second class to the third up the fourth . I remember it was in the first term in April . I remember one time when Habyarimana had died ; he died on the 6th of April 1994 . But on the 7th that is when I knew that he was died yet others knew it earlier . We were seated outside the house with several other people who were wondering about the president 's death . And after some time , we saw across in Mushubati and other areas , houses burning . We were many people seated outside . And , immediately we saw a very big group of attackers coming from Bandamiko they were the Bakiga , who lived just across . They were with a certain man who was called Fayineto ; he was our neighbour . He was introducing them the areas , which were mainly occopied by Tutsis . They passed in the midst of our group and said , "@ there is a big number of Tutsis living in this area ! It is only the Tutsis covering this hill . Therefore , once you are done with those areas in the valley , you will come and do a good job here . @"
Ubwo baravuga bati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose abatutsi nibo batwiciye umute...umukuru w' igihugu , byanze bikunze ntabwo mugomba kubaho . @" ubwo uwahoze ari Bourgmestre wa commune Mabanza , yitwaga Bagirishema Ignace . Araza ... yagendaga n' imodoka avugira muri micro [ indangururamajwi ] avuga ngo @: "@ abatutsi bose aho bari nibazamuke bagende kuri commune , babashe kubarindira hamwe bose . @" Kubera ko bari batangiye kugenda batwika impande n' impande , hasigaye ahongaho i wacu . Ariko baheraga hasi bagenda bazamura . Ahitwaga za Mushubati bari bamaze gutwika , za secteur za Gihara , noneho baza bagana i Rubengera . Tubonye bari gutwika rero twumvise n' imodoka ihise ku muhanda , ari kugenda avuga ngo , ngo @: "@ abatutsi bose ngo nibahungire kuri commune , kugirango babashe kubarindira hamwe bose . @" Twese turazamuka , na papa na mama n' imiryango , turazamuka . Tugeze kuri commune hari abantu benshi cyane , hari ku itariki zirindwi [ 07 ] . Burira buracya , ku itariki umunani [ 8 @/ 04 /1994 ] abantu bakomeza kuza ari benshi , kugeza n' ubwo babura ahantu bahagarara , kuko ikibuga cyose cya commune cyari cyuzuye . Kandi abantu bakiza ari benshi . Noneho Bourgmestre Bagirishema akomeza kuvuga ati @: "@ kuko abantu bakiza ari benshi , kandi abakiga bari kumanuka ruguru iriya , babafitiye umugambi yuko bagomba kubicira ahangaha .

Therefore , they must n't live . @" Then the former burgomaster of Mabana district ; Mr. Bagirishema Ignace came . He was moving in a car speaking loudly using a microphone , he was saying that , "@ all Tutsis wherever they are should come up at the district 's offices in oder for them to ensure all the Tutsi 's security at once . @" Because they had started burning from all sides except our home village . However they would begin from the valley and come up to the hill slowly by slowly . They had burned all those ends of Mushubati , Gihara sector , and they were proceeding towards Rubengera . Therefore , after realising that houses were being burnt , yet someone was anouncing that all Tutsis should seek refugee at the district 's offices where they would offer security services to all of them . We all went to the district ; my father , my mother and families all of us we left for the district . When we reached there , there were many people , it was on the 7th of April . Morning come , which was on the 8th of April 1994 but people continued coming in big numbers . Then Bagirishema the burgomaster went on and said , "@ since several people are still coming , yet the Bakiga are coming from up there with a plan of killing you from here . I guess the best idea is to carry your properties and babies , and help those who can not walk , up to the stadium . Since it is a big place and well fenced , it will be easy to protect you as required . @" Truly at the district it was not secure because it was an open place with people coming in big numbers , others were on the road ; some would come with all their belongings ... So he said that we had to go to the stadium where we would all be protected . Geneerally it was the safer place where no one would attack us and be able to do any harm to us .
Akimara kubivuga atyo abantu bari bakiza ari benshi , ubwo abandi bahita bamanuka . Iwacu twari abana barindwi , abakobwa babiri n' abahungu batanu . Njyewe nari uwa kane , nakurikiraga abahungu batatu umwe aravuga ati ... yitwaga Epa ...

[ Ubwo papa yaratubwiye ati @: @"@ ni ukugenda twese tukajya ku Kibuye kuko murabona ko nta kundi byagenda . @" ] aravuga [ Epa ] ati @: "@ njyewe ntabwo nshobora kujya ku Kibuye , ngo nemere gupfa nk' imbwa , njyenda njyana n' aba bantu bose sinzi ... Njyewe ngomba gusubira mu rugo wenda bahanyicire ariko sinshobora gufata urugendo ngo njyende ku Kibuye . @" Ubwo arabyihorera we asubira mu rugo , noneho uwitwaga Aimable na Pacifique njyewe nakurikiraga , baramukurikiraga .

Abandi batoya babiri nabo basigarana na mama bose bajyana muri stade . ||| As soon as he had finished saying so ... people were still coming in big numbers and others were leaving . We were seven children and home ; two girls and five boys . I was the fourth born , the first three were boys . So one of them said ... he was called Epa ... Epaphrodite Dushimimena . He was a bit old ; he was in senior four [ secondary ] . He said ... but dad had told us that , we should all go to Kibuye because there was no other alternative . @" Then Epa said , "@ I will n't go to Kibuye to wait for death like a dog , follow all these people ... I have to go back home and rather die there than taking a journey to Kibuye . @" So , he refused going and went back home . Then my other brother called Aimable with Pacific whom I followed , they followed him and they were taken to ... there was a certain man who was a family friend . He was related to the burgomaster and they were living in the same gate . That is where they were taken . Then my sister and I , we were taken to ... there also another lady , to whom my mum was a godmother . At times we would live together . We were taken to her home and we stayed there . the remaining two who were the youngest , stayed with mum and went to the stadium with her .
Ubwo twamaze kugenda baragenda bagerayo turabimenya ko bagezeyo . Undi nawe yasubiye ku matongo ... kwanza hari ku matongo kuko bari bamaze kuhasenya ariko batari batwika . Twebwe tuguma ahongaho ntabwo twari tuzi uko byabaye , twari tuzi bagiye ku Kibuye bakabarindirayo barangiza tukazongera tukabonana , kuko bari batwohereje n' ahantu ubona hagaragara . Kandi abantu bari baziranye na bourgmestre ba hafi muri famille tukumva ko nta kibazo dushobora kugira twebwe . ||| After we left , they also left and when they got there we were informed . The other one went back to the abandoned home ; it was already demolished though they had n't burnt it . We stayed there and we did n't what had happened . We thought that those who went to Kibuye are going to be protected and after some time , we would join up again . Because they had sent us in a home that was well off ; ‘ people who were related to the burgomaster ! ’ we thought we were really safe .

And , in the evening uncle Gasasira brought all the cows , which were at home in that home where we were . Then he went back . But before he left , he told us that , "@ several people are still coming in Kibuye but they are all worried because there is a rumor that they are going to kill them . There is a possibility that we will never see each other again . @" Be said bye to us and left . We stayed there and suddenly there came a group of attackers saying [ they were singing ] ; we have wiped away all the people who were in the stadium in Kibuye . They are all finished . Maybe those who remained in their home areas are the ones who have survived and we have to search for them seriously . We shall use dogs to hunt them so that no one stays behind . @" Apparently those who went to Kibuye were the old people and they had killed all of them . They had set roadblocks on every entrance and exit of the stadium . No one was able to get out ; whoever would need to pass they would hack him or her . After hearing that ... since I was the eldest to my sister whom we were together , I realized things had worsened . Then I wondered , " since they have killed them , where are we left ? @"

After hearing that he said , "@ all in all they will come back for you @" his name was Munyagishari . He continued , "@ Among the people who are most wanted in Rubengera , there are three men . Those three must die ; "@ Gahizi is among them . @" my father , he was called Gahizi Evariste . Then he went on mentioning the names ; "@ Karungu is one of them and Leonard . @" Leonard was my father 's colleague ; they were teachers in Mushubati . "@ Whatever it takes , they must die . They will even come to kill you in my eyes . @" He told us . We could n't understand what he was taking about . Therefore , we sat outside with other kids . When we had that all those who went to Kibuye were killed , we knew that we are the next to be killed . And , whenever we would try to enter in the house , that man would tell us that , "@ remain outside because they will come to check in the house . And in case they found you inside they would kill me not leaving you , and demolish my house . Therefore , keep on playing with other kids outside they will n't know you . @" And then certain group of attackers went to Karungu 's home . Karungu had also refused to leave his home so he remained there in Ndara where he lived just across a place called Gacaca . And when that group past , there was some lady called Seseko , who knew our family . Then she said , "@ the man who lived here was a good friend to Gahizi . He used to look after his children and now I guess his children are in his home . @" As soon as she had said so , they past where we were seated with other kids . Then she said , "@ this kid resembles the mother so much ; she ressembles Dativa . @" Then she came close to me and said , "@ show me your hands ... smile for me ... @" she said that Tutsis have a dark gum , long fingers , their ribs have a special shape ... the she asked me , "@ you must be Gahizi 's child , do you disagree ? I just kept quiet . "@ Look the way she is proud ... anyway , let 's go to work first ... @" it was a very big attack of about thirty people . I only knew Seseko plus a another man who was called Byiringiro ; he lived in Kigabiro . Those are the people who seemed to be so active and they were the leaders of the whole group . Then they said that , "@ let 's go , we shall work on you when we come back . @" Therefore , they continued their journey towards Karungu 's home as we stayed there .

Look your father is dead , your mother is dead too , your brothers none is alive ... @" It was around the 10th of Apri 1994 . Then we left his home after telling us those words . I told my young sister that , "@ let us just take the road and go because there is no where else we can hide . @" Where could we hide ? "@ dad I dead , mum is dead , no one is alive . Are we going to stay with this people ? can we live with them ? @" in my whole life , it was my first time to feel a lot of pain within me . I never knew how to cry neither did I know malice . Generally , I never knew ‘ suffer ’ I just got confused .

Therefore , she must die together with them . Because there is no Tutsi entitled to survive from this land . Then that man imagined and said , "@ impossible ! You can not kill my wife . It is impossible , how can you kill my wife ? She is not a Tutsi . Maybe it is just something that occurred in a family where she is related to the father of these kids . @" Then they called his wife and asked her , "@ how are you related to these kids ? @" She said , "@ they are my nieces . @" Then they angrily left . While leaving they said , "@ we shall come back for you . @" As they had just left ... meanwhile , that man told them that , "@ at least take the cows and maybe if you are to come back , we should talk about other thinks but do n't kill the kids or my wife . I will tell you the truth . @" Then , in a small distance , there were other attackers in the coffee plantation . Therefore , they came at once and took the cows . One of the cows was very aggressive yet it was the fattest of all . So , as they would try to take it out , it would act violently trying to kill them . So it ran and how they killed it , one would hack at the neck and another on would cut the tail , till when some of them aimed from in front of it and hacked it 's cloven hoof . Then the cow could n't move anymore ; it fell down . And after it fell down , how they slaughtered it ... it horrible ; one would cut the leg and go . And , the other one would take off the head and go , another one would take the other leg , until when the skin was left on the floor .

Then I laid down , "@ if they find me lying then may mistake me to be a corpse . @" I imagined . I decided that it was better to lie on road maybe one would hit me accidentally and then I would rest . Because I would imagine living alone in this world and I would find it very hard to understand . I got confused with a lot of sorrows . Then my sister told me that , "@ let me tell you ... @" she was called Dudu as nickname but her true name is Uwumukiza Grace . She said , "@ listen , Clemence .

Then I decided to lay in the way so that they come and step on me or hit me at once rather than being killed with torture . Therefore , I came down the hill and laid in the way . Then she said , "@ bye ... I can not dye just seated here . @" Immediately she left . That was the last time I saw her , [ it was around the 12th April in 1994 ... until towards the end of September , that is when I saw her again ] She just left me and said that she could not sit and wait for her death .

My father , My mother , my brothers and my young sisters , all I have lost them . I imagined all that and got confused . I started searching my family members but all of them were killed . I was left alone . So I could n't understand it . Then I woke up and asked myself , "@ what can I do ? @" I thought about going to the stadium but it was impossible , then I thought bout going back to the other family where they had chased me but still it seemed impossible . Then I said , "@ I wish dogs would come and eat me , because I would die and there would be nothing much left to worry about . @" I failed to find a decision . Later I decided to follow some small route that was in the sorghum plantation . I was hoping that I would attackers , who would be looking for survivors to kill them so , they would kill me . I decided to keep walking aimlessly , wherever night would find me , I would sleep there . I did n't want to hide myself anymore .

It seemed like he was coming from killing someone . But I kept on asking him to kill me in fact we fought for the knife . I begged him ; "@ I am left no where , please kill me . This is the worst death . The best you can do for me is to kill me . @" Then he said , "@ sincerely Bebe ! I like you and I used to like your parents . But I can not kill you though I killed so many people , and I am still killing others . The people I have killed are uncountable and I will kill other more . But I can not kill you because I can be accused of your blood . I knelt down and begged him again ; "@ you would be of much help to me if you killed me . Please I am begging you . There is nothing I can offer but God would reward you for that . @" He looked at me and said , "@ no ! I would never commit such a sin . @" "@ But you already committed it , because you killed others . But now I am begging you to do it for me . @" I said to him . then he said that instead of killing you , "@ let me show you . @" But I told him that , "@ wherever you may take me , it would be the worst death for me . The best you can do for me is to do something that would end my story . Because surviving alone in this world ... look I will never stay there where you are going to take me . @"

She was tall and slim and wherever she would pass they would attempt killing her . They would let her go after mentioning her brother because he was known as a colleague whom they worked together . So she would come home after they released her . Then the brother told her , "@ Therese , you have to stay with this kid . She should never fail to get water for bathing or food to eat . You should be together wherever you may be . @" Her sister agreed . She took me to the bedroom , washed me , and gave me food to eat . Then I slept . At around 11:00 o'clock , the other old woman came [ the one whom we first lived together ] she coming looking for us from every where because she was told that , "@ Gahizi 's children died from some place . @" She heard it from the people who passed us from where we were seated .

I would see everyone passing , the attacker , although I would notice them . They used to be mixed up with the Bakiga from up there . I would see Seseko ... that lady who was called Seseko was the common figure , maybe it was because she was the one I knew before . I also knew Dushimimana , they passed by ... night would fall . I would sit and watch . They came up with a new system of hunting people with dogs , after realizing that people no longer live in the house . They would send dogs in the sorghum . Truly , most people survived from the sorghum plantation . Lets say one would walk a bit trying to change a position or when one is tired of either sitting or sleeping . Then we would separate the sorghum plants slowly and we would move without shaking . Because it was in the valley , they would stand on top of the hill and see shaking sorghum plants . Immediately they would send dogs and blow whistles . And , maybe it would show signs of raining . Whenever it would rain . I would fell relieved , because I used to know that no one would hunt me from the sorghum plantation , while it was raining . Maybe they will go to homes but no one can allow to be beaten by rain just looking for me . Suddenly , I heard ... I was trying to shift from where I was , because it was very close to the road yet groups of attackers were still coming from the stadium . Therefore I decided to extend upwards because I was afraid of dying while I was watching . I said to myself , "@ I better expend a bit and in case they run after me , they will find when I already fainted . @" So I changed the place and went a bit up . Suddenly , I heard whistles . "@ There is somebody there . Check in all sides in the middle of the plantation . The plants are moving , there must be people . @"

Then I said , "@ they rather bite me but will n't catch any . @" I sat down . They were about twenty dogs ; they would come while barking wearing bells in their necks . Then they had reached close to where I was one of the killers communicated to the dogs to come back and go the other side , where they had seen other people . Therefore , all the dogs went there . When the dogs ran , that is was when I heard how happy they were , saying that they have found someone . Then I prayed , "@ God , why did n't you make them come here ? @" I saw how they were killing people and I would wonder . I never imagined the kind of death I would die . I got confused . Then I was them coming up with a certain man , who lived there in Gacca with his wife . He was called Boniface , he was taken to Mugano ‘ Bamboo ’ [ a place that was named after the common plant in the area ] ; a place which is at the road that goes to Kibuye , just below the commune 's office at a place where , there used to be a football court . There used to be bamboo just near the market . I saw that it was Boniface with his wife that they were taking . They took them to the bamboo and there was a roadblock . They said , "@ we could n't find this man during the time of traitors . Now what kind of death should he die ? @" I was watching every step in a distance . But I would n't believe it ; those acts were beyond my imagination . They used to have spears though they never used them to kill people . They would use sharpened bamboo ; they would sharpen it till when it appears like a spear yet it was a stick . They would display them on a line as if they were on sell . Everyone who would pass there , yet he or she was among a group of attackers . He would take one as he wished .

I would see it from a distance . He pulled the lady 's intestines and tied them with the husband 's intestines ; you could see that he was struggling to tie them together because he would shake almost falling down . Then he tied their intestines together and then one of them told his fellow who was tying them , "@ after tying them , make them stand up and ask them to stop us as the used to do . @" That is how he told the fellow . I was watching them ; I was in a bout five meters distance but I was in the sorghum plantation . Therefore , the man replied that , "@ we can not stand , it is impossible . @" They were lying down . Then the perpetrator said , "@ okay stop us again from moving . This is our government and we shall do what we wish to do or want . So , show us that you can stop us now . @"

Then I saw another group of attackers coming from the stadium and I said , "@ how am I going to die ? @" I could n't imagine how . Then I decided to go back to the other family in Gacaca in the other man 's home . But I would imagine going back there yet all cows were finished , I knew he would handle me to the perpetrators . He wanted some profits out of those cows . Because he looked after them and cared about them all the time . Then I said , "@ if I go back , he will handle me to the perpetrators . Then they would kill me in the same way . @" Days had gone ; it was about mid May . I took sometime imagining how I would go back to that home but finally I decided to go back in the sorghum and sit . It was in some trench and they had lied grass [ vetiveri ] on top of the trench . Therefore , I sat in there up to night . I spent almost three days in there . It was very silent because those days it would rain a lot yet they would n't go out for people while it was raining . Therefore , after those three days I stood up and walked in the sorghum plantation again .

I did n't know where I was ; I felt like I was coming from very far and I would n't imagine what had happened to me . Then later I started recalling what had happened , all that had happened to Boniface ; how he was killed . I began wondering if I was dreaming or if it was real . I spent a long time thinking about it . And a round 11:00 p.m. in the night ... but they were still blowing the whistles ; they would retrieve someone just next to me , then retrieve others the other side .

But I was affected by only one thing , ‘ thinking too much . ’ Then I would recall the memories of the place where my brothers passed .

You have to join others . @" dad ignored him and continued to go . I recalled all that after I saw that policeman who was with the burgomaster when they were checking at home . In a moments time after the car had passed , I would see how they were catch people and killing them . On one would get a person and kill him ; let 's say hit him or at once with a club . They would cut off a foot first , then hit him or her with a club , and leave him or her still alive . They had clubs of this shape ... they used to call them ‘ Ntampongano y'umwanzi . ’ They were spiked clubs , with nails and if they hit it on the leg , there would remain holes on the leg . And , if they hit it in the head , it means that , the bone would be crashed and one would keep bleeding . But one would n't die , depending on which part they hit . Therefore , whenever I would see how they kill people , I would just tell that I would die a painful death and I would immediately move . I immediately stood up and started walking around in the sorghum plantation . That time I was not meeting people anymore instead I would meet dogs . Whenever they would see plants shaking they would send dogs . So I would faint and wake up the following day in the morning . And , I would neither tell where I was nor what had happened . That is how days would go by but if there were no sorghum plants , I wonder what would have happened . I guess none would have survived . From then , people stopped coming instead they would send dogs . Then I got so hungry but I did n't know what to do . There were no other crops rather than sorghum . Therefore , you would imagine eating grass , which was impossible . After all , thoughts about food would come to your mind only when you were resting , which was for a small time . Most of the time one would n't feel hunger or ... we could n't drink , that was out .

Hari nko mu kwa gatandatu gushira ... kwanza ukwa gatandatu kwari kwarangiye hari nko mu kwa karindwi . Kuko numvaga bavuga ko hasigaye ukwezi kumwe , cyangwa ukwezi n' igice ngo abana batangire . ||| It was in the late June ... in fact the month of June had ended , it was in July . Because I would hear people saying that , "@ there has remained one month or one and half month for students to begin studies . @"
... Ukwezi ? Oya . Nkabikurura nkumva simbyumva . 'Ubuse nzajya ku ishuri nte?'Ikintu cyose nahitaga ntekereza mbere . Mbere iyo twajyaga gutangira ... mbese byose byabaga ari bishya mu rugo .

Nuko umugabo arabimbwira , ndaceceka kuko numvaga ambwiye neza , nkumva ko ibyo aribyo byose , ni umuntu mwiza ... ntacyo . Nubwo yabaga yankoresha , ariko ukabona ko amfitiye impuhwe .

Ubwo nyina yasigaye atetse , ise akavuga ati @: "@ mwese mugomba kwicara hano mugasangira nta kibazo ... @" ||| Only a month ? No. I would imagine it but I could n't figure it out . "@ How can I go to school ? @" everything I would first think about it in advance . Before , whenever we were going to begin school , everything would be new at home . "@ So , what about now ? Will I start studying and in the evening go to dig ... ? @" I would ask myself but I could n't understand it . I never used to think about such life or believe in it . He told and I chilled because he had told me good news . At least he was sympathetic with me , so it was fine . He used to make me work but at least somehow I see that he would sympathize with me due to the agony that I was baring within me . But it was okay . Therefore , "@ I told him that it was fine . @" He spent some long time at home ; he spent about a whole month at home . Then said that , "@ you all have to go together for water and come back together . @" We would go in the morning ; if it meant early morning , we would all wake up and the wife was there . But we were not on good terms with the wife . If it were digging we would all go . They would dig because they knew how to dig . As for me , I would pick up all the grass and later , we would sit and chat up to mid @-@ day then we would go back home . She would stay at home preparing some food . And he would say , "@ you all have to sit here and share with no quarrels . @"
Noneho umugabo ... Ariko icyo gihe nari maze kubona nta kibazo , abantu bakagenda mu nzira , nkabona abantu baraje tukicara tukaganira yenda baje nko gusura abongabo , nta kibazo numva nta kintu kerekeranye n' intambara bavuga . Ntangira kumva nyine ko noneho intambara ishobora kuba yararangiye . Nkumva sinkigomba kugenda nihisha cyane . Amasaka bari batangiye...bamaze kugira...gutema , ndavuga nti @: "@ nta n' ahandi . Noneho n' ukujya ngenda ku mugaragaro nibashaka bazanyice ... @" ||| Then he ... during that time I would n't see any problem ; people would move freely . People would come and we talk , I mean people who would come to visit that family . They would not talk about anything like war stories . Therefore , I started getting a feeling that the war stopped . I felt like I should stop hiding myself . People had started cutting the sorghum . Therefore I said , "@ since they have cut this place , there is no other place remaining . I will be walking in the open and if they are to kill me they should kill me . @"
Nuko . Eeh ... , ubwo habura nk' ukwezi ngo abana batangire nibwo umugabo yongeye gufata urugendo .

He used to go up country ; I do n't know what he used to do there . Therefore , I said , "@ since he has left , I am going to die . I am going to die a horrible death . @" so I decided not to stay in that home . "@ I would better go @" I decided . It was supposed to be a journey from Gitesi to Mabanza in some place in Rubengera at the other man 's place . [ The place where I lived at first ] . It was a long journey about three or four kilometers on a road . Then I said , "@ let me show you ; I am going to leave Gitesi and go to Rubengera . I will go back to the other home and if I reach there before anyone tries to kill me , that will mean that I will never die . @"
Kuko ni umuhanda noneho ndi kugendamo , kandi mbere niwo nagendagamo nikinga . Mfata inzira ndagenda ...

Therefore , I went with children and when we had reached some where , she called them saying that , I must stay there alone . "@ Really ! I stay in the other garden alone ? Why does n't she do the same things when her husband is around ? " I wondered . Immediately I took back the hoe and gave it to the kids and I told them that I have left . "@ Where are you going Mahoro ? Came back we show you . @" They said to me . [ they used to call me Mahoro ] I told them that , "@ No , there is nothing to show me , I have gone and if they kill me , that will be it . And if they do n't kill me , we shall meet some other time . @"

On my way I met about two or three people only . People had stopped moving . Umh ! That scared me too . "@ I have walked three kilometers and I have only met three people . Maybe people finished . Maybe even where I am going they may not be there . where would I go ? @" I was confused . I continued walking alone and finished the journey . I left the other place at around 11:00 a.m. but due to the sorrows , I would move saying , "@ what if I sit here by the roadside ? What if I pretend as if I am looking for some place and then go to ask in a certain home maybe they would shelter me or call upon the killers to kill me in case they can not stand me . @" I had several problems but I would find death as the easiest solution . Umh ? It was the only solution that would get me out of there . Therefore , I kept on delaying on the way and reached there when it was already dark . I reached there at around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. on my way I met very few people like I told you . There was no car passing in the road . Therefore , I said , "@ is over people finished . Where will I go ? @" I asked myself . It also became a problem like the other one . However I never thought about going back . Even if people killed me from the roadside or ... but not colonizing me in a home with the situation that I was in . I believed we would never understand each other .

So they asked me , "@ what has happened ? @" I told them that , "@ I have come . @" So the old lady asked me , "@ why have you come . Well here the war stopped . Few people are moving . @" It was in the end of July . "@ few people are moving you can sit here and tell me what happened where you were . @" Then I told her that , "@ there , Beatrice would take me to dig , send me to fetch water alone while her kids would stay at home . She would tell me that I must work since she hid me . When I realized that I can not manage , I decided to come here . @" She welcomed me and I lived there .

I would go at the road and come back safe . I would see children from that family but I would n't see any of the people I used to know . So it became a problem to me . So I asked myself , what is all about such life ? I would try to see the future but I would just go beyond my understanding . Therefore I decide to stay there . The old lady told me that I wait in September I would go to school . But I would not believe it ; "@ I will go to school ? @" But still I would remember that at home , my father used to like children who liked studying . And indeed we liked studying . Both my father and mother were teachers . Therefore they would say that , "@ you must study ... you shall study till when ... @" and we were many kids at home . Mum would tell us that , "@ all of you must study ; you will go secondary schools and complete university . Even though we miss salt at home , you will go school . @" And surely I wanted to study and go secondary schools ... and reach university .

In the following class we would be ten but now they will call and it will be only me . And so they will start saying that , "@ we study with only one Tusti . @" So it would bother me but I would try to avoid such thoughts because it was the only life I had to lead . I knew my life was school life . I had to complete primary school and pass it well so that I would get a school where I would live always . And I would stop living in outside families . I would go to a school where I would stay and live with people I never knew . I started aiming at that goal and I felt like it was the best one .

Therefore , they would say that , "@ we saw them with big ears with ... @" Umh , generally I would think they were animals .

Come and play with other kids . @" and I would say , "@ no I do n't want . @" Sometimes I would go back home at around 10:00 . Break time would reach and then other students would get into groups then I would remain alone . Therefore , after a small time I would go home .

That woman was a Tutsi ... she took her home and my sister told her all about her . Then that lady hid my sister in the house but her husband was not aware . Until September that is when we met . As she got out we immediately saw each other . But her husband never knew about it . It was a very big house and therefore , she hid her somewhere in the house and warned her elder children that , "@ nobody should ever open this room . @" And even her husband would never come to the room ; he used to go and come back deep in the night . He would come going to bed directly . Whenever she would want to go to the toilets , that woman would send the kids somewhere and obviously the man would n't be around . Therefore , she would go to the toilets and then come in quickly . She stayed in the house all the time . No other person knew that my sister was in their house except her elder son and daughter plus her . Only the elder children .

Even the husband did n't know . But the other woman , who used to purchase clothes for sale , knew about it because she was the one who referred my sister to go and look for Gatabazi 's wife wherever she was and she was also a Tutsi . "@ Go and tell her your problems maybe she may give you shelter . @" She recommended my sister . Therefore , that is how she came to know about it . She was the one who sent a message at Munyagishari 's where I was living saying that , "@ there is a Gahizi 's child in Gatabazi 's home in Gihari . The one that resembled her father , big in size and dark . I wonder her elder sister is maybe she died . @" And , by coincidence I was alive . Then I told them that "@ Sara is telling lies ... she is lying ... she is lying . @" But she said , "@ I am very sure she is alive and in fact I will go to visit her tomorrow . And if I see her I will come to confirm to you . @" She left and the following morning she came to tell me . "@ Do n't worry , she is alive . @" She said to me .

You should come and take me there . @" I told her . The following day she came back and took me . We crossed some river called Ntaruko . The other side of the river was Gihara sector and when we reached there , I saw her . It was like a dream ; I cann't say that we greated each others , neither did we ask each others about what we went through . We were simply crying by looking at each others . I would look at her and ask myself , "@ is she the one or it is her ghost ? Someone who was bitten by dogs ? Someone I saw landing in the attackers group and being taken by the attackers ? Someone I heard stories of her death , how can she be alive ? @" it was unbelievable though we were face to face . It was like a movie that lasts too long ... yet nobody was talking ... we were talking within our thoughts . It was beyond my imagination and so I got confused .

They were two aunts and they were living these ends . Therefore , she told them that , "@ keep hiding her , if I get their aunties I will tell them and they will come for them . But continue hiding it from your husband so that you do n't get conflicts together at the last moment . He may even decide to chase her yet she has no where to go . @" then she came and I immediately went home . The man had come back so I went back in Gacaca where I lived . And , that woman too left . And when she came to purchase clothes , she met our aunties and then she told them ; "@ do you know that your two kids survived ... ? @" but thought it was impossible ; "@ is there anyone who survived in Kibuye ... ? @" to them it sounded unusual . But she convinced them , "@ it is true at Kibuye some people survived . They never went to the stadium ; they just hid in the neighbor 's homes ... and today they are alive . @" But they never agreed with her . Therefore , she told them that they should sometime come with her and see where we lived . She told them that one lives at Gatabazi and another one lives at Munyagishari 's home . Munyagishari is the one we lived together and they already knew him . After visiting my sister I returned home and went to school . After two days I went to school but I would come home at 10:00 a.m. as usual . However when she told our aunties about it , they immediately boarded and came over .

When they reached at home they told them that I had gone to school . Therefore , they decided to come to school yet I was on my way coming back home , because I was used to going home at break time . There is a way you see something and become stiff ; I was walking home but even though I was walking , I was careless of what was around me . I would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how I was going to lead it . It seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part . Therefore , we met as I was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) . I used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . Because I would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me . I would talk to no body . So I would feel like life has stopped ... so I would finally go home .

They were coming to see me at school . It was an extraordinary experience ; it was like similar to the time I saw my little sister after five months of not seeing each other . Each one thought that the other one died . Therefore , I was shocked and stood like a tree . So I ask , "@ Aunt , is it you ? Are you the one I am seeing or it is somebody else ? @" she replied that was the one . "@ Are you aware that Doudou is alive ? @" I asked her once again . She replied me that "@ Doudou is alive and I know where she lives . @" Therefore , we never reached at home where I lived , immediately I took her to Gihara where Doudou ( my sister ) was living .

Ubwo hari nko mu kwezi kwa kangahe ? ||| Which month was that ?
Ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwa cumi , icyenda na kane [ 1 /10 /1994 ] . ||| It was on the 1st of October in 1994 .
Mbese kuva mu kwa kane ubuzima bwasaga n' aho bwahagaze . ||| Generally , right from April life seemed to be a terrible struggle ?
Kuva mu kwa kane kugera mu kwa cyenda , ubuzima bwari bwarahagaze . ||| From April to September life was a terrible struggle .
Tuvuge se nko kuva igihe mwabereye kwa munyagishali , intambara isa n' aho itururutse bwo mwabanye ubuzima nibura bubaye bwiza ? ||| Well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined Munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ?
Urumva intambara isa n' aho igabanutse , usibye ko ... ubundi yenda navuga ko mu kwa karindwi ... ukwa munani intambara yari itangiye koroha , mu kwa karindwi kwanza yari itangiye koroha . Ariko nabaga aho hantu mpaba na none nk' umuntu wihishe [ Aho ngaho nabaga I Gitesi ku mukobwa we ] . Noneho nkahaba ... kubera ukuntu bamfataga , bamfata kubera ko bampishe nkumva ko nyine ari kwa kundi ko bakimpishe . Simenye yuko hanze hameze neza .

Ejo nkazongera nkabyuka nkajya ku ishuri nkitahira saa yine , bitewe n' uko nabonaga ndi jyenyine nta muntu wundi tuvugana . ||| When the war siezed ... in July , August the war was siezing ... in fact , in July the war was beginning to sieze . I was living with that family as somebody who was hiding . I was living in Gitesi at her daughter 's home . And due to the way they would treat me , I mean because they hid me I continued believing that they were still hiding me . I never knew that outside the situation improved . Even the time I left their home for Munyagishari 's , I still believe I was going to hide . However , that feeling started disappearing when I started going to school . I could go at home with out any problem , I could eat , there is nothing I was obliged to do . I wouuld wake up the following morning and again go to school . Then I would come home at 10:00 a.m. depending on how I would be abandoned .
Abana bo kwa Munyagishali bo mwari muri ... wabonaga bagufashe gute nyuma ya Jenoside ? ||| How could you find your relationship with Munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? How was it ?
Ubwo nyine intambara imaze kurangira urebye uwo mukobwa niwe wakomeje ... twakomeje kubana , n' ubwo wabonaga ise arakajwe n' uko twarokotse kandi akaba nta kintu kihasigaye , inka zaramushizeho kandi yenda ubona ko nawe yari abifitemo inyungu , hari n' igihe rwose yajyaga yivumbura akavuga ati @: "@ munsohokere ahangaha . @" Mbese nta jambo...nta kuvuga ngo yenda...nta kuvuga ngo yenda ngo mbe namubwira nk' ikintu runaka , yumvaga ko ndi uwa hariya wowe na bariya ... mbese ubona ko afite umutima mubi .

Ariko uwo mukobwa we twabanye neza nta kibazo , niwe wamenyaga . Niwe wamenyaga ngo nkeneye ikayi niba ngiye kwiga ... ||| After the genocide , we continued to live with that lady . Definitely her father was not happy at all because , we survived but all properties were taken from him ; the cows were gone yet he was considering them as a profit . Some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream . One could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper . And from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him . The cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most . She could remember that I need books if it was time for school .
Ubungubu se mujya mubonana ... hari ... ? ||| Do you meet often ... is there ... ?
Yee twarabonanye uwo mukobwa mu minsi ishize yarimariye [ mariage ; yararongowe ] twarabonanye aba hano ku muhima turasurana nta kibazo . ||| Yes we met . She got married of recent so we met . She lives just here in Muhima and we visit each other without any problem .
Iwabo ? ||| What about her home ?
Iwabo ho ntabwo nari nasubirayo ||| I have never gone back to her home .
Kuva Jenoside yarangira nturabasha gusubirayo ? ||| Since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ?
Oya . ||| No !
N' ukutabishaka cyangwa n' ubushobozi bukeya ? ||| Is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ?
Si ukutabishaka gusubirayo , urebye ni ubushobozi bukeya . No kuba natekereza ngo nongeye gutekereza gusubira ku Kibuye ntabwo ari ibintu bijya binzamo . Keretse habaye nk' ikintu runaka , nk' impamvu ngiye ... injyanye yo ku buryo mpita ngaruka . Ariko ntabwo nari nasubirayo kujya kubasura . Si uko mbanze...si uko batamfashe neza se yenda nk' uko nabyifuzaga , ahubwo urebye ni ubushobozi buke . ||| It is not because I do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means .
Ni ukuvuga ko utarasubira rero aho mwari mutuye kuva Jenoside yarangira . ||| Does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ?
Kuva Jenoside yarangira twasubiyeyo muri 1995 . ||| Since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 .

Andt the mselves told us , "@ so and so took some bricks from your house and as you can see , they used them to build the fence .

You spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside...can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ?
Nk' iminsi navuga ngo nabaye hanze ... ntaba mu nzu ? Urebye nko mu cyumweru niba baje gusaka nko muri iyo nzu kwa Munyagishari , niba barazaga kuhasaka nk' iminsi itatu .

In fact , if the perpetrators were to come three times in a week to look for me at Munyagishari 's place @- for example , if they came on Monday , I would n't have to be there on Tuesday and Wednesday ! Otherwise , they would...so they would n't get me whenever they would come . Then , theyy would just come back after two days but the issue of their come back was just about cows though they would pretend that they were looking for someone . Everytime I would be aware of their arrival , I would gao and spend some days in the sorghumfield .
Kuko ibyo aribyo byose hari igihe cyumvikana ko wamaze igihe kinini cyane wibereye mu masaka . Icyo gihe wari waravuye kwa Munyagishali basa n' abakwirukanye noneho ... ||| It is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield .

All of us @-@ seven kids @-@ were going to school and above all our parents loved us too much and they were the kind of people who always show us love and emphasize education as they were . They were always there to make us feel good to the extent that we would feel like there is nothing wrong that could happen to us . I just do n't know how to express it ! it was like living in paradise without any worry . I never worried at all and I think that 's the reason why it was hard for me to live with people who treated me bad . In fact , I never knew about it ! I was never used to that kind of life , I did n't even see that happening in the neighborhood !

It is something that happens to me often , I remember that one time as I was going at secondary school , it crossed my mind!I felt...there was even a time when I could think being traumatised because I could n't bear sitting on the same desk with a Hutu student or sharing a meal with him @/@ her or using the same bucket or...for me he @/@ she was kind of pariah , a pariah and I could n't talk to them . however , after a certain time I was no longer behaving that way . I just do n't remember how I changed , maybe it 's Gob because I , personnally , did no effort . I was used to be lonely wherever I was and there was none for me...I was feeling like the only solution was to die because otherwise I would suffer for always . But today , I thank God because I feel free and I am positive about the future if God continues to be with me .

When I see that he is not very confortable when we meet , I start thinking that maybe he is the one who killed my people or...I just become inquisitive about him . All this makes me belive that if were n't alive , I would n't have all those problems , I would n't think to do this or that according to the situation , I would just rest .

But I am sure that if you get a perpetrator somewhere and ask him to tell you exactly what happened bevcause you know that something happened there , he will n't tell you anything ! I think they shoud talk and say exactly what happened and say things like "@ I was here and this is how it was ... @" then he can plead guilty or deny his participation or say that he had been influenced ...

Just the fact that one recognizes the wrong they 've done makes their sentence less severe . But personally , I do not agree with that way of doing it . This should be the case only if the killer feels guilty of what they did because otherwise , it would be a way of reducing their punishment while they do not have any conscience . I am saying this because you can meet somebody ... I always meet many people ... when you meet somebody whom you saw killing , they take a different route or they turn back and flee . If it were somebody who has truly acknowledged their wrong ... or maybe they only did it in order to have their punishment reduced because if they had truly confessed , they should even be able to recount everything in details especially because they know very well there 's nothing we can do against them . Because if that was your intention , if you wanted them imprisoned , you 'd know where to find them anyway . That 's why I do not agree with the whole process . Personally , I would n't release a prisoner just because they 've acknowledged their wrong deeds . Maybe it was fine at first ; it looked like a way of reducing problems , at least that 's the impression it got . That 's what I think . You will hear people saying that anyone would agree to plead guilty just to have their punishment reduced and that does n't necessarily mean that they feel guilty for the wrong they did . They are n't even able to publicly confess and to recount the events of the time in details . You know very well that when you have something on you conscience , talking about it does you good . The weight of it feels much lighter once you 've shared it with someone else .
Ubwo rero nkabona ko biriya bintu byo kuvuga ngo basohoye abantu gutya gusa , kuberako bemeye icyaha hano umwe hariya undi , hano batanu , hano ijana , hano ngo magana angahe...ngo bemeye icyaha hano ngo barasohotse , numva ari uburyo bwo koroshya ibibazo nta n' ubwo njya nanabyiyumvisha ngo numve inkurikizi zabyo , numve n' impamvu babikoze .

Ese akinjiramo ukwezi kwa mbere...umwaka urashize , imyaka ibiri...Yari ataratekereza ngo amenye impamvu ari aho ngaho ? Ukareba ko harimo abantu bagenda barebera ku bandi , kubera ko ba kanaka byagenze gutya , natwe bigomba kugenda gutya . Kandi koko ukabona niko bimeze . ||| So , in my opinion , releasing someone just because they admit what they did , releasing a hundred ... a hundred people ... I think it 's a way of simplifying things . I do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be . We should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time . Some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail . At the end of it all , we realize that 's how things work .

Today , we have the Funds of Assistance to Genocide Survivors , Fonds d' Assistance aux Rescapés du Génocide ( FARG ) in French . It helps in paying survivors ' school fees . Survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from . I am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness . There are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today . The Government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... I think it 's good .

It is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that . I have had the grace of knowing God and I know He can do anything ! I would therefore tell the survivors that it is God who protected them during the wat , nobody else did ! I would invite them to live a prayerful life because without Him , no one would be where they are at today . Through prayer we find a certain peace that helps us to accept what happened and we understand that it had to happen that way . And also that God is not unaware of what is happening to us . But it 's only when one undertands the importance of prayer that we can be able to reach such a conclusion . On the other hand , orphans are confronted to various problems , they are n't stable and ... they do not understand that things come and go . Some of them behave very badly without realizing where the money for the education comes from . They do not ask themselves how things would be if they were n't the way they are . It is very clear that some students are n't serious about their school work at all and yet it should be their number 1 priority . My message for them is to be aware that they are orphans and that they should n't so much count on the families with which they live . Whatever they do , they should n't forget that they are orphans ! They should n't forget where they are coming from because the moment one recalls where they are coming from , their behaviour gets better .

The message I would like to give as I said from the beginning is a message of love , everyone needs to love their neighbour wherever they are . I am convinced that if everyone had shown love for one another , what happened would never have happened . No father would have killed his own children ! There was no love at all during genocide . Everyone is supposed to love their neighbour as they love themselves . I know it is not easy but at least we should make some effort ! Because when you love your neighbour as you love yourself , you will never think of killing him or her or of making him or her into an orphan but you will have compassion for them instead . You would want to put yourself in their shoes , you would think of a situation where you get sick and there 's nobody to take care of you ... So all I am asking is that people love their neighbour as themselves . It is very difficult especially for orphans and for those who lost their loved ones ... it is very difficultn for someone who is n't ‘ saved ’ to ... to understand that there 's nothing good in revenging . It is true that your people were killed but it is over ! I am not saying they should forget , I myself can not forget , it is something that will always be part of me . And when one remembers how it happened , it becomes ... depending on the period in which we are , things are the way they are . We should n't forget what happened because remembering , looking at where we are at today and being able to that despite everything , there 's some improvement . Because that period was part of another life . Today , we 're in another life . The life in which we were and today 's life ... We need to think about it but that 's not a reason to cnstantly live in the past without thinking of anything else . Yes , we need to remember , just like it is impossible to forget that we were born and that we shall die one day . But thinking about it ... we need to think about it with the intention to show gratitude to God for what He did , by looking at where you came from and where you are at today , gratitude for the fact that you have reached the time in which we are living today . I believe there 's nothing wrong with thinking about it as long as we are not living in the past . We need to think about it in the sense of ... yes , to think abou tit . And also to have love and to be able to forgive . Personally , I have completely forgiven them ! I have forgiven them because I know they did it because ... I know they did it ... but maybe as they say it themselves , they were only tools in the hands of someone else or some other power .

Kuko burya hari ukuntu umuntu akora ibintu bitewe n' uko ari , ingeso runaka bitewe n' uko we yumva ko nta kibazo . Ariko nibura wagatekereje...cyane cyane harimo nk' abana benshi bamara kwigira hejuru bitewe n' ubuzima abayemo , yenda abayeho ubuzima bumeze neza famille yifashije ... Ariko akagerageza kwiyibagiza bya bindi . Noneho agashaka kugenda...ni nko gukata mbese . Akagerageza kubyirengagiza...mbese na none agashaka kwirengagiza uko yakagombye kubaho . ||| Personally , I do not understand how a human being healthy of mind can attack another human being with 2 ears , 1 nose , legs ... just like him or her . A human being like him or her ! And they take a machete , hack him or her down and see blood shedding ... it is beyond understanding . Personally , I do n't think that person did it by himself or herself , but they were used by Satan to an extent where I have forgiven them all , it does n't matter whether they have asked for forgiveness or not . What happened happened and it is true that I can not forget it . For those who are still in school , I would tell them to seriously study and to prepare themselves a better future . It happens at times that they want to behave in a certain way depending on the town in which they live or which school they go to , but it should n't be the case . A child should not forget what is behind maybe just because he or she is lucky enough to live with a well @-@ off family and thus behave as though he or she should n't live in a certain way .
Harimo abo yenda mujya mubona usanga nabo barwaye sida , si uko yenda yagendeye muri izo ngeso kubera ko akeneye ikintu runaka yabuze . Si uko ... sinzi uko nabivuga . Mbese ni ukuvuga ngo ni ukwiganana . Kugenda kuriya ngo n' uko kanaka agenze kuriya '...nanjye byagenda yenda nk' uko nawe bimugendekeye.' Ariko siko biri . Ugomba gutekereza igihe cyose @: "@ ... ndi inde ? @" Gutekereza uwo uri we...icyo uricyo mbese . Ukagenda muri ubwo buryo bw' uko uri , apana kwigana ingendo y' undi . ||| I believe you see some with AIDS not because they walked in such or such ways but because she wanted something and could n't afford it . Not because they ... I do n't know how to put it ... It is just because they wanted to do what their fellows did hoping that she would be as successful as their fellow was . But that is not the way things are . All the time you have to ask yourself , "@ who am I ? @" thinking about who you are ... the kind of a person you are , and then you behave according to who you are rather than imitating someone else .
Nta kindi wakongeraho ? ||| Do you have anything to add on ?
Ndumva ibyo ngibyo bihagije . ||| I guess that is enough .
