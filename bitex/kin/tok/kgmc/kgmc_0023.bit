They came on Friday , that is how they came and then we saw a flame of fire we were at the market , they said that they were burning Tutsi belongings then we moved a bit because the other side was burning , when we came that night we found houses had been burned and the neighboring houses were also burning and then I sat down , I had people to but people were no longer alive ,

They said that Tutsis have been attacked , how have they been attacked ? It is happening again ! Since I was a child they were burning Tutsi belongings , chasing them away and now it has happened again ? So I said @: ‘ that is how it is . ’ And then I told the others , ‘ listen to me kids . The war has begun and you all should go home . I do n't want to die with you ’ Then I sent some of the kids at home . That night passed and on the following day , I saw them taking a young boy ... they came to me and said @: ‘ there is where...' they sent student 's books ... when he came home from school with many books brought by a boy of about his same age . I kept the books and after keeping them I saw someone called Wellars coming . I took him in the house and asked him where he had been then he said that he was from Kigali . I asked him @: ‘ When did you arrive ? Habyarimana died yesterday but one...when did you come ? ’ he said , ‘ I came yesterday ’ . I put him into the house and locked the door . Many more people came in the house and among them were girls . I said to myself @: ‘ If I put these girls and the men together and that they get discovered , they will tell everything they know . Girls are not good at talking . ’ Then I made some traditional medicine and gave to one of them and told her to drink and smeared the other with it . Stayed with one of them and I told the rest to go home .
Abo wabwiye gutaha ni bande ? Abatari abatutsi ? ||| Who were those you told to go home ? Were they Tutsis ?

I told them to go home and then they went home , go home and die there because the war has begun , and I was left with the other girl I smeared them with medicine I would not bath them and they came another young girl and I stayed with all of them . I brought them into the house because they were young saying they would have said it . I remained with the other one tied her to my clothes like this , we walked around together when I went out of the house there she was with me and thought to myself there is nowhere I am going to reach with these children with this young girl , and they said that we will get her from you when I went to fetch water they would say that we will get her from you and I said that you will n't get her ! Why get her from me she is a Hutu do you think she is a Tutsi ? When I went to fetch water I found corpse all round , I said this is a tragedy in my home so they came closer and closer and I asked them what is this that you are doing ? They said that if I say what I had seen they would kill me on my way to the market . On my way to the market they surrounded me but I had drunk my medicine and I had some in my hands . I told them , you are lying and they said , is it a surprise ? Presidential guards who had come from Kigali came I got some fuel from them and I said that if anyone ever came to get anyone in my house I will burn them . Just like they would burn me . They threatened to kill me , they said that since that old woman likes Tutsis we will kill her , we do n't know her back ground and neither do we talk to her .

I would go out to my back yard then I could come back and wash clothes and put it there , I whistled and they ran in . I started putting padlocks on both doors , and we stayed that way for a month , more came and when I figured out that there place was being over crowded I would take them out somewhere else .

I could try and called these things and shake other things to . I would say Nyabingi will eat you ! I told those that had come there . They asked do you work with witch doctors ; did you come after meeting them ? I also live in Rwanda I have my Nyabingi let me come ! I got up and started knocking like this ! And things would shake with these bracelets and they would run . They ran and they called the Interahamwe and presidential guards . One presidential guard came in saying that they wanted medicine ; I asked them what Kind of medicine do you want ? They told me the medicine they wanted , I went and got it for them . I had prepared porridge I gave them and we drank and then I told them , what if I opened the door will you look inside ? They said yes , I opened the door and I asked them do you see any person in here ? They said no , then why do go telling people that I have people in here , as an old woman you think I can hide someone ? Can I know how to hide a child or a woman ? I thought that If I said a man they would suspect it so I did n't say it instead I said children and women . So I said I will send you an animal and beasts to eat you .

They told me not burn a roadblock ? And I said to them , then why do they burn you ? I said it 's not possible ! Wellars is the one who called and I told him not talk about me again . I went where the cups were I brought them I took them . I said you should n't come out ! You should urinate and defecate here ! I took the wastes and they said we are killing you , I said is there worse death than this ? That 's how I did it after doing that , other came presidential guards came they gave me a girl that came from Mugina . They said that , Take this girl we are giving her to you because you were good to us . After the war we will come ask for her if it does n't end and you die together fine ! Then there came some stupid guys , they told me to give them the girl and I said it 's Impossible , I can n't give you this girl , is she yours ? They said that you will give her to us ! And the girl said to me , instead of them killing you let them take me ! I it 's said impossible , I said let me first pray and I brought my mat and prayed and said God be near me and rescue me , the girl got out of the house and she went with them , while they were undressing her the Inkotanyi ( RPF ) there like pa pa ! There they were , and the others were like wait the girl escaped .

They pointed them at me ; I was sited somewhere here I said all that is nothing ! They left their guns here and there and the others came , I went up there with a girl called Bebe we went to fetch water and the Inkotanyi came and said @: ‘ hey ? ’ I said ‘ yes ' ‘ Why are you fleeing ? ’ I said , ‘ fleeing from what ? ’ ‘ Fleeing from the Inkotanyi ? ’ I said that I was also Inkotanyi ’ ! ‘ If you want you can tell I am also Inkotanyi I said that there is no Inkotanyi that is greater than me , they said but you 're an old woman , I am an old woman ? So if you have you mother and you 're an Inkotanyi she also one . So they came in and brought everyone out said hello that was it .

I was one and the in another war , in the referendum war , they killed each other I was seeing I was here as a woman ! My in laws hide people ! The killing of Gafiiligi Gaspard and his your brother Bikotwa ! Hiding those , at my parents in law hiding three cases of money , I was a seeing ! Why do think was n't supposed to do it ? Mama came home from grinding sorghum and they hide two me in the fermentation pit and covered them with sorghum flour , do n't you think I was seeing , a child comes from their mom .

Inama nagira abari bato , nabanza kuyigira abazungu , nkababwira kuko bajya kwica , bajya kwica mu gihe cya kera bica agasore ka Runanira , n' umukobwa wabo n' umuja wabo bavuga ngo nimuga ngo ni musaza we wabishe , RUDAHIGWA yaragiye azana abazungu azana n' amafoto ashyira hejuru y aya mafoto naho ba babiciye , hazamo amafoto y' umugabo we bavuga nicyo yamwiciye , ni nicyo yamwicishije , bahita bahita bamufata ahita yemera n' ubu abazungu nuko banzanira abantu nkuku bantwikiye , bakaza bagashyira cya cyuma cyo hejuru abantwikiye bakaba bafata n' abantera bakaba babafata , ||| Before telling the young children I can first tell the white people , that long time ago when they were going to kill , when they were to kill and man named Runanira and their daughter and maid and saying that it is their brother that killed them , Rudahigwa went and brought the whites and brought their pictures and placed them on other pictures where killed them from and there came her husband and they said why they killed him and what he used to kill him and they got hold of him and he accepted up to now the whites even though they burnt his things , and then they came and put their machine in the air and then get all those who come against me
Nyine turakubaza icyo wabwira abazungu n' iki kubyerekeye uru Rwanda ubona hari uruhare bagiye babigiramo ? ||| That 's it we are asking about the white according to what happened to Rwanda do you think they played any role in that ?
Oya , nta abazungu nabonye bishe , uuuh ||| No , I did n't' see any white man killing .
Ariko nyine iyo amateka agenda igihe yagiye aba wenda hari icyo bari gukora kugira ibyo babikingirire ? ||| But in history as time goes on they could have done something to stop it .
Iii samateka nari gukora nkuko nabo bayakora , nuko badutabaye , n' icyo nabashimiye , baradutabaye , n' ubu bakomeze badutabare , batabare abategetsi , batabare abo basumba , batabare nkuku , nkuku bamfashe amafoto , bavuge bati uyu mukecuru arashinganye ! Banshingane , ||| Yeah , it 's history I also could have done like they can do , just like they saved us that 's what I can thank them , they saved us let them keep on saving us , save the leaders , save those that they are above , save like this , like they took my picture , they say that this old woman is insured
Hanyuma ndakubaza inama muri rusange yo kugirango nk' ibi ibyabaye bitazongera kubaho n' iyihe nama waha abantu ||| So I ask you another , what is your message for this not to ever happen again , what can you tell the people ?
Ni ugusenga Imana . ||| Just to pray to God
Nta kindi ubona mu mibanire ... ||| Nothing else in the standard of living ........
N' ugusenga Imana ntaho njyewe sinzabana nabo kuko banyiciye umwana ejobundi umuhungu , banyicira n' umugabo . ||| It 's just to pray but for me I will n't live with them because they killed my child and later my husband .
Uravuga abantu bicanye ? Interahamwe ? ||| You are talking about people who killed each other ? Interahamwe ?
Interahamwe , uuuh ||| Interahamwe !

Nibiyunge , nibasohoke babashyire hanze , nibamara kubasohora , bose babashyire hanze , uwibye bakamufata bamurasire aho . ||| Let them reconcile , let them bring them out and after bringing them out , those who steal they catch him and shot him on spot .
Wowe wumva ko Uwakongera gukora ikintu nk' iki ngiki ari ukwicwa ? ||| You think someone who does something again like that should be killed ?

N' ibihano bikomeye bikaze , uwo hakurya avuge ati kanaka yishe none ibyo bakoze , nitubikora bakadufata natwe baratwica ! ||| Very tough punishments , some aside then says that somebody was killed , what he did we should n't do the same .
Hanyuma se nkawe wa kera wigeze wumva ibi bintu bya amoko igihe yagiriyeho , ||| So someone like of long ago did you ever hear the racism things when they started ?
Jyewe ? ||| Me ?

Mbese uwo babonaga yifite bamwitaga umututsi ? ||| So those who were rich were called Tutsis ?
Yiiiii , wabonaga yifite ? Babona uri umuhinzi ukora babona uri umuhinzi ukora ? Bati uriya n' umututsi , atunze inka , bati nimumwice , tumwibe , tugire dute tujye mu bye ||| Yeah , he would be wealthy . When they could see you as a cultivator doing that kind of work ... Then that one is a Tutsi with cows , kill him and we still his belongings , then take over his .
Mbese ubundi urumva ko ibintu by' amoko byagiye bijyaho bikurikije nu nuko umuntu yari akize ? ||| So you can tell that this thing of racisms went according to how rich one was ?
Uko yari afite , uko yari ameze ubundi bose bavaga indi imwe , ukagira mwene nyoko ukavuka wamukibita amaso.wabona akuruta agiye kwa she agiye hariya yakorera uriya akamuhereza inka ati shyuuu ati wa mututsi baramuhaye ati umwice , nta kundi ||| It was according to what you had , in other words they were all like brothers and sisters and you had your sister and when you saw them being greater than you and doing something for that person and they gave them a cow and you like that Tutsi is being granted that you should kill them .
Byatuma noneho ushaka kutubwira uko cyane abantu bagendaga bapfa ibintu ? ||| Then that can make you tell us how people killed each other because of property .
Bapfaga ibintu , uuu bapfaga ibintu , umuntu nkuwo mwana muri kumwe babona uko asa , babyara undi mwana ba batasa , bati uriya bamubyaranye n' umututsi kandi ise wabo ari umwe , ||| According to the property ... how they were ... you would set your eyes on your brother . When he become bigger than you and he worked for a someone that rewarded him with a cow , you say the Tutsi has been rewarded . Kill him . No other alternative
Ndagirango nkubaze ku bintu byerekeye ubumwe n' ubwiyunge uri kumva hakorwa iki kugirango bugerweho ? ||| I want to ask you about the Unity and Reconciliation . What do you think can be done to achieve it ?
Ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ? Ako ubu urashaka ko nkubwira ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ? Eeeeh , reka rero nkubwire ! Ubumwe n' ubwiyunge muzagenda mwicare hariya asome ku nzoga usome ku yindi aguhereze , namara kuguhereza , uvuge uti ndashaka kujya gukonyora , uhite ujya gukonyora , ugaruke usange ya nzoga arayihumanyije uup akwice , jye ntabwo nziyunga ngo dusangire ||| Unity and Reconciliation ? Do really want me to talk about unity and reconciliation ? Ok ! Let me tell you ! Unity and reconciliation you will go and sit there you drink alcohol and another and pass it over , then you will go to the toilet when you come back you find that your beer has been poisoned and he kills you , me I will n't reconcile and share some thing

Ubu ngubu bira biraruhije , nibabafungure gusa , baze bage iwabo bakore uwo basenyeye bamwubakire , uwo basenyeye bamwubakire , nibamara kumwubakira nibyo babane , uwa uwiteye hejuru bamufate bamusubizemo ntazavamo azavamo ntabwo azavamo . ||| We need to live , who likes you ? Now it 's difficulty , let them free them from prison , let them come home and build for those that they destroyed for and after that they live and anyone who put his head up they put him back to jail and never let him out .
Naho nko se kubyerekeye gacaca unayizi yakera , iyubu ubona yakorwa ite ? ||| So what about the Gacaca Courts you know it since long ago ? How do you think it should work now days ?
Iyubu , iyubu , umva , gacaca y' ubu abenshi bishe barapfuye ! Bagiye biyahura , yewe n' abanjye banteraga no hirya aha kuru uyu muhanda bahambyemo abantu hano ku muharuro , ku muharuro wanjye hano babonye ko bapfuye baravuga bati uriya mukecuru ubwo asigaye aratuvuga bahita biyahura . ||| The one of today , listen many of those who killed are already dead ! Some of them committed suicide even mine just near here on that street they buried them here on the yard they saw that they were left and said that his old woman is going to report us and they committed suicide
Ariko tuvuge nka gacaca y' ubu tuvuge abishe bariho ||| Let us talk about the Gacaca if those who killed were still alive .
Nari ndaha munzu , nicaye ntya ! Mbambye ntya , sinabona kanaka ngo araha abari mu nzu barumvaga abanteraga , barazaga bantera nkavuga cyane abari mu nzu akaba aribo bandika , ntabwo nibuka amazina yabo rero kuko baturukaga kure ||| I was here in the house sited like this , crucified like this , I can n't say that someone is here , those who were here can tell that , whenever they came I spoke out loud and those in the house were the ones writing so I do n't remember them because they all came from far .
Ariko se nk' impanuro waduha kugirango gacaca igende neza abanyarwanda bongere babe abanyarwanda ni mpanuro ki?cyane dushaka kumenya nko kubyerekeye ukuri ||| But what can you really tell us so that our Gacaca can go accordingly and people live together ? Mostly we want o know about he truth
Ukuri , ukuri n' ukugirango bazane cya cyuma ||| Truth , the truth is for them to bring the other machine

Kirahari , kirahari mwimpisha , we ntubizi jye ndabwira abarimo hariya muri kiriya kigo babazane babafungure bazane icyuma babashyire icyuma hirya no hino uwakoze icyaha wese azazamo , nanjye bazampamagare , nanjye bazampamagare ||| It 's there do n't hide it from me , you do n't know that I am telling those who are in that camp bring them , free them and the put the machine on both sides and those who participated will be seen , and they should call me also .
Ubwo cg urashaka kutubwira ko ibintu byo kunga harimo harimo ababibonaga , ||| Really or you want to tell us in reconciling there those who were watching ?
Eee , harimwo aba n' ababibonaga , ||| There are those who were watching ,
N' ukuvuga ngo abo babibonaga bashobora kugira umuganda batanga bagasobanura uko ibintu byagenze ? ||| Or you want to tell us that the things of reconciliation there those who were observing it
Eee bakabivuga , uuuh ||| There those who saw it .
Icyo ubona kugirango ukuri kugaragare ? ||| What should be done for the truth to be told ?
Niko kuri kugiye kurimo , kuko ababicaga n' abasibirizaga nibyo , hakaba harimo nabo babeshyera ||| That is the truth that is there , because there those who were killing , the sensitizers and those who were innocent .
Hanyuma se nka wowe ubona cyane icyatumye iyi genocide iba abantu baka ......... ||| On your behalf what do you think was the cause of the genocide to the people ... ?
N' inda nini , n' inda nini no kujya kuzungura , bakavuga bati uyu ntitumushaka , uriya yarize , agira amashuri agira kujya iBurayi agira ku hari na da na musaza wanjye uheze iburayi , witwa Mussa Twagirimana yaheze iyo yagiye ku bwa kera bashaka kumwica ubu niyo ari . ||| Selfishness , selfishness and wanting to have other people 's belongings , they could say , we do n't want this one , he is educated , he 's been to Europe , my brother Mussa Twagirimana is stuck in Europe . Where he went long ago when they wanted to kill him and now he is still there .
Urabona ibyinshi bishingiye noneho ku mururumba inda nini ||| So you think most of it is based on greediness ?
N' umururumba ! ||| It 's greediness
Hanyuma se kugirango ibyo bitazongera ingamba zafatwa n' inki izihe ? ||| So for that not to happen again what can be done ?
Nibaze bahinge , baze bakore , ugize nabi ugize impanuka imutware , ugira kuvuga ati ndashaka ibi n' ibi no kwanga undi agende bamujyane . ||| Let them come and cultivate , let them come and work those who do bad things ... have accidents , he who says that I want this or I hate this is should be taken
Hanyuma se nkawe nk' inama ubwo waduha ya nyuma ||| What advice can you give us ?
Iya nyuma nimufungure ba bariya ba ba banze kuvuga bati ntago twise , none ubwo tutishe wenda muturekere ibyo kandi koko harimo aba abatishe bavuga bati ntitwishe , harimo uwarebaga , harimo n' umuhungu wanjye uriya uri ahantu iRirima mwene Bekerinka , witwa nta Kabanyura , we yazize ngo yuko uwo yari yarahishe mbere nyuma asubiyeyo bongeye bagarutse bica wawundi baramubaza bati ngaho , tubwire abaje iwawe bari baje kwica wa muntu arihe ? Umuhungu ati ntabwo mbizi ko aribo bamwishe , ati tubwire abo aribo ? Nicyo kimuhejejemo.n' abandi n' abandi n' abandi , naho abishe koko bavuga bati twarishe barishe , ariko akantu ka gaci gaciye bugufi ka kantu ka ka nyamuhererwa , kakaba gafunze , bariya bakomeye bavuga bati twarishe kariya nigaheremo , ntabwo kishe . ||| The last one , free those who say that they did n't kill , since we did n't kill let us free . There some people who say that they did n't kill , and indeed they did n't kill , some were watching there is also my son who is in Ririma son of Bekerinka , also called Kabanyura , he had hidden a person and later he was killed , so he was asked , people came to your home came and killed him where were you ? He said , I do n't know it 's them who killed him , tell us who were they ? That is what has gotten him stuck in there . And many others but those who say we did kill when they did . But the simple like him in prison . The great say we killed but he did n't let him stay in prison .
Ubwo nukuvuga ko harimo abantu bakomeye badafunze ||| That is to say that there are great people who are not in ?
Iiyiiiiiii , naho buriya buciye bugufi ||| Yeah ! But those simple ones
Ubundi ahangaha , watubwiye ko wahishe abantu benshi babagaho gute ? Wabonaga ibyo kubagaburira gute ? ||| You told us that you managed to hide many people , how did they survive ? Where did you get what to feed them ?
Si wowe wanze ko nkugaburira , ngo nawe urebe ibyo baryaga?baryaga ibishyimbo , baryaga ibijumba , uuuh ||| It 's you who did n't want me to feed you and you also see what they were eating , beans , they were eating sweet potatoes .
Washoboraga kubikura he se ? ||| Where did you get them ?
Aha Munsi y' urugo rwanjye , uuuh ||| Just nearby !

Aho re ! N' uwicaga undi yarazaga nkuku wa wamubwira nkuko umbwiye ukagira uti iii ubwo akaba aramutanze , ntacyo nakomaga , ntacyo navugaga . ||| Gosh ! Those who killed , if you said anything they would report you and thus you would have given up some one . I could n't say a thing .
Mbese ntabwo wigeze wiyambaza abaturanyi ? ||| So you never asked for help from you neighbors ?
Reka da ! Uwo niyambaje nuwo umwe najyanagayo umuntu ||| No , only one to whom I took people to .
Witwa nde ? Muhamudu ? ||| His name ? Muhamudu ?
Muhamudu , niwe najyanaga umuntu nti ba umbikiye umuntu nabwo sinamubwiraga ngo mfite abantu , uuh naramubwiraga nti mpuye n' uyu muntu mumbikire ||| Muhamudu is the one that I took people to . I would say I met this person please hide him for me but I never told him that I had more .
Ubwo watinyaga iki ? ||| What did you fear ?
Natinyaga ngo batamvuga , uuh ||| I feared that they would report me .
Ako se nko muri icyo gihe nyine ibiryo uko kwezi kose washoboye kubibona kurinda kurangira cg baryaga dukeya ? ||| How did you manage to feed these people for a month ? Or they had little to eat .
Ariko kwari uko ukwezi ko ari amezi abiri ? Intambara yamaze amezi abiri . Nari mfite ibijumba nari mfite ibishyimbo narahingaga nari nkiri muto ||| But was it a month ? It was two months the last two months . I had beans , I had sweet potatoes . I cultivated , I was still young .
Ariko harimo wenda nabasohokaga bakagenda ? ||| But there is also like those who used to get out and go ?
Aka uuuuu , cyeretse ucancitse , uwancitse umwe n' ubu arafungiye iGitarama kuko baramusahuye n' umututsi bari banamutwikiye muri icyo gihe mvuga ageze hano hakurya yigura ikimasa , baravuga bati ngaho rero kubita umurambo , ngo akubita umurambo nicyo bamufungiye , ntawe yishe , ariko akaba afunze . ||| No , except the one that escaped , up to now he is in Jail in Gitarama because they rooted his belongings . He was a Tutsi they burnt his belongings . At that time when he left they caught him and he gave them a bull for them to let him go so he was told to bet up a corpse . He ran off but now his in jail yet never killed .
Ubwo afungiye nyine ibyo ngibyo yemeye gukora . ||| So his in prison only for what he accepted to do ?
Iii , nibyo cyakora dufu tuje duhungutse nijye wagiye muri leta nti njya guhuruza nti nimuze munkurire imirambo imbere yanjye ||| Yeah , that is it , after we came home from exile . It 's me who went to the government told them to come and get the corpse from my front yard .

Ok , tranche ya mbere hirya hariya , hari umugabo w' inshuti yannjye kera najyga nubakira , noneho nza kujya hariya hirya kuri Electrogaz , bavuga ko abakozi babo bavuga bumvise ukuntu bari bumwice , w' umupasiteri , mbese yari omoniye iShyogwe hariya kwa Musenyeri Musabyimana , ubwo bavuze uko bari bumwice , ariko nkaba naraganiriye n' umuntu w' umurundi ambwira ukuntu ba baciye imyobo abaforodebu bihishagamo nanjye numva kabisa ngomba kumuhishamo ndawucukuraaaa , ncaka ibiti umwobo wa metero enye hariya hari hafite metero enye kuri eshanu , nkajya ntinda gutya kabisa , ndangije nkuraho plafond y' inzu yanjye ndagenda nsasaho maze gusasaho , nshyiraho ibitaka kuburyo nta mvura yageragamo , njya kumuzana ngiye kumuzana , ampa undi muntu witwa Emmanuel Twagirayeze w'Ntongwe , ubwo arambwira ati uzagaruke kumbwira , ubwo nsubiyeyo , , nsanga abndi batu bari bahahungiye harimo umukobwa w' uwitwa Kabirigi , Ancila , we yaria nzi twari twariganye , arambwira ati nanjye ugomba kunjyana , yari afite n' abana babiri n' umwana wa mukuru we wapfuye ubwo ndabazanana mbashyiramo hariya , maze kubashyiramo ubwo ari babaye batanu , umugabo witwa Bugene wa hano hakurya , mbese ubwo bakajya baza kundeba mbese interahamwe ziza kundeba ntizirabukwe , bakaza bakareba hano munzu , bagasanga inzu mbese nta kintu kirimo , nta muntu urimo nta nicyo barya kirimo ariko bibereye hariya muri uriya mwobo . ||| Ok , the first section there , there was a man who was a friend of mine who I used to build for , then I went to that side of ELECTROGAZ , they were saying that their employees were saying that they heard them say that they were going to kill him , a pastor in fact he was a chaplain Shyogwe there at Bishop Musabyeimana , then they said how they were going to kill him but I had talked to my Burundian friend who told me how FRODEBU used to dig holes . I thought of hiding him and I looked for trees and dug this hole four meters deep five meter wide , and I dragged the ground like this and then I took off the ceiling of the house and I took it to the hole and covered it . I added more dust to an extent that rain could n't penetrate through . I went and brought him . He gave me another man from Ntogwe called Emmanuel Twagirayezu , and he told to come back and tell him . After some time when I went back I found more people that had come among them was the daughter to Kabiligi , Ancila , she knew me we had been together in school . She asked me to take her with me , she had two children and one of her late sister . I brought them and put them in there to now there were five of them , a man named Bugene from over there , he could always come to see me with the Interahamwe and they did n't recognize any thing , they came and searched my house nothing was in it . No one was in there and there was nothing to eat for them yet the people were out there in the hole .
Ubwo Bujene nawe tukaba twari tuziranye aza kubinsaba kubera ubwoba icyo gihe umuntu bafataga yarahishe abatutsi barabicanaga , noneho nanjye mbona amaze nk' umuntu ungenza ndamuhakanira , kugeza ubwo yaje kubimbwira mbese numva nawe ko afite abantu yabuze uko agira mbwira ngo bari buze kumusenyera , ni hakurya aha , ndamubwira nti niba ubyiyemeje , mbese kuko urumva nta kurobanura umuntu n' undi byose yari umuntu kandi gupfa byose ni kimwe , jye nravugaga nti uko bansangana bano batanu nuko bansangana cumin na bane niko byagenda , ubwo naramubwiye araza amfasha gucukura uno mwobo wa hano twa ||| Then Bugene with whom we went way back came of fear at to ask for refuge for his people . At that time people who they found hiding Tutsis they would kill them all , I did n't believe him I thought he was a spy . I said no up to when he told me that he had people and he did n't know what to do with them . He told me that they were about to come and demolish his house . I said ok if you are willing , there is no making choices on one person to another and dying was all the same if they found me with five or sixteen it 's all the same , I told him that and he helped me digging some more
Mwucukura ryari icyo gihe ? ||| What time did you dig ?
Ubwo twatangiye kuwucukura satanu z' ijoro irondo ritashye , tuwurangiza samunani turatindaho , kabisa ubwo mvanaho plafond , dushyiraho , tumaze gushyiraho turasiba , nari mfite ibiti hano by' imivumu na siple ndazana ndasasira hano hari insina kuko umwenge wari uri mu nguni hano y' insina tumaze kuhasasira mbese aBantu bajya baza ntibagire ikintu babona , nabaje gusaka hano munzu hano ntibagire umuntu basangamo bibereye mu myobo , usibye ko imvura iyo yagwaga nabavanagamo nkabashyira munzu mbese abaturage bakababona ariko imvura igwa ariko hariya hakurya , ariko imvura yahita nanjye ngatanguranwa nkabazanamo , kuburyo nta muntu wigeze arabukwa , ubwo igihe kiza kugera intambara irarangira , inkotanyi zigeze ino nibwo bavuyemo , duhita tujyana duca muri iriya zone inkotanyi zari zafashe nuko , ngaruka inaha mu kwezi kwa karindwi , intambara irangiye . ||| We started digging at eleven when they had stopped the patrol and we finished at two in the morning . I removed my ceiling and we used it to cover the trench . We ceiled it with soil and I had many .... trees and the charismas trees there I brought them used them to prepare it and then we covered it since the hole was towards that banana tree . Those who came in for searching could n't see a thing . The people were in the holes outside . At times when it used to rain I would get them out and put them into my house even the other residences could see them but it would be raining and when the rain is almost over , I would hurry up and get them back into the holes so that no one ever saw them . A time came when the war ended and the Inkotanyi arrived they got them out and we went to the part which they had conquered . I came back in July after the war .
Nta ngorane se wagendaga uhura nazo ||| Did you encounter any problem ?
Ingorane se sizo nahuye nazo nyine ? barazaga bakankubita bakambaza , ariko noneho nkabahakanira bajya mu nzu ntibagire umuntu basangamo bantu bibereye hano mu myobo , ino nzu yo nari narayimutsemo kera bigaragara ko nta bantu barimo mbesetwajyagamo mu buryo bwo kugama imvura , ubundi ba yahita nkabazanamo . ||| Problems are what I encountered ? They used to beat me up while asking me . I said I did n't know and they got into the house but saw nothing , I had abandoned my house and you would tell that nobody lived in it , it was there for them to shelter from the rain .
Ariko ubwo kugukubita hari nkababaga batanze udukuru ||| In beating they must have been people spreading rumors ?
Eeee , n' abantu babaga batanze amakuru babaga babonye bavamo bagiye kugama noneho bakavuga bati abantu bajya kugama hariya imvura yahita twajya kubareba ntitubabone , niho ikibazo cyavaga , ||| People would have said it those who saw them going for shelter , and they would say that people go for shelter in there yet after we look for them we do n't find them , that was the puzzle .
Hari ibyo bavuga hari igihe hari igihe hari abigeze kuvumurwa , noneho abaturanyi murafatanya , sinzi icyo wabitubwiraho ||| People say that some were found in there hiding , and neighbors helped you . What can you tell us about that ?
Icyo gihe baravumbuwe , nari mfite mukuru wanjye andwanaho nabandi bitwa ba Thomas n' abandi baturage bandwanaho , kuburyo nta kintu byafashe . ||| That time when they found them , I had a big brother with some others like Thomas and the citizens . They helped me and it led to nothing .
Abavumbuwe bari ahagana he ? ||| Where were those whom they discovered ?
Bari muri uyu mwobo wa hano ||| They were in this hole right here .

The people then saw her it was like at 1 Pm , they came and removed the cover . The RPF had arrived in this area so nothing happened and no one was hurt . All the fourteen are still alive .
Hanyuma , watubwira nk' amazina ya bamwe nicyo bakora ? ||| Can you tell us some of their names and what they do ?
