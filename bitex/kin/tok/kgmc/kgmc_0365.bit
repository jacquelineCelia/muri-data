Ku buryo arizo zabazamukanaga zibatunyuranaho hariya hirya aho twari turi . ||| They were killed by interahamwe , because soldiers were rarely here , they were in republican guard barracks , others were on the other side at majyambere 's place , this place was mostly occupied by many interahamwe , who walked the peope who were going to be killed .

Ariko nyuma umudamu we yaje gupfa , apfuye ejo bundi igihe ubuyobozi bwavugaga ko nta bantu bagomba guhama mu nzu twamukuyemo tumujyana ku mushyingura ku Gisozi . ||| When we came back from refuge we arrived first because we had fled to Indera ( it 's near ) , we knew where they had been buried , we exhumed them , we took some to Nyanza but one man named Raphael Rwamukwaya who was staying nearby , his family , his wife was still alive and asked to bury him in her house , but after some time his wife died , the other day the authorities said that no body should be left in houses , we exhumed him and took him and reburied him in respect in Gisozi .
Hano hepfo ku muhanda ku cyapa cya taxi hiciwe abantu barenga barindwi , bishwe n' interahamwe , izo nterahamwe zabicishije imbunda , babatabye munsi y' umuhanda wa kaburimbo , mbere hari inzu ariko ubu hari ikibanza , hari na atelier yo gusudira ariko bigaragara ko mbere hari hari ikibanza . ||| Down the road at the bus stop sign , seven people were killed from there , they were killed by interahamwe , those interahamwe killed them using guns , they buried them below the tarmac road , there was a house before but it is now empty land , there is a tailor shop but one can clearly see that there was an empty land .
Abo bantu barindwi bishwe bate ? ||| How were those seven people killed ?
Abo bantu barabarashe , barabarashe kubera ko benshi bari bafite imbunda . Bishwe n' interahamwe zarengaga nk' icumi . ||| Those people were shot , they were shot since many had guns , they were killed by more than ten interahamwe .
Ubu hariya hantu mwebwe ko ari ku muhanda , iyo muhanyuze mugenda , wenda muri nko muri taxi mwumva mumeze mute ? ||| That place is at the roadside , when you pass the place walking or in a bus what do you feel ?
Iyo tuhaciye kubera ko twanahabaye igihe kirekire , n' ubu akaba ariho dukunda kunyura iyo tuhageze mpita cyane cyane iyo ndikumwe n' umuntu mpita mubwira ngo aha hantu haguye abavandimwe , inshuti n' ababyeyi . Ku buryo rero ntashobora kubyibagirwa . ||| When we pass here , having stayed here for a long time , we still like passing here , when we reach here i emmediatly...especially when i am with someone i emmediatly tell them that i lost my relatives , friends and parents here , and thus i can never forget .
Kuri wowe wumva ko n' abandi bantu bamenya nubwo bwose byabereye ku muhanda ? ||| Personally do you feel that other people should also know about it even though it happened at the roadside ?
Bamenya ibyahabereye kubera ko ibyahabereye atari byiza kandi nta n' uwifuza ko byakongera kuba . ||| They should know what happened since what happened was not good and no one would wish for it to happen again .
