Ubwo twakomeje kuba muri ETO , abenshi muri ino quartier ya Kicukiro...aho twabaga nyine . Nibwo baje muri ETO ahongaho bari bizeye ko bashobora kurokoka , noneho ubwo hashize iminsi ... le 11 mata [ 11 /04 /1994 ] nibwo Minuar [ Ingabo z' umuryango w' abibumbye ] yafashe ... bavuga itangazo rivuye muri ONU rivuga yuko bagomba gutaha . ||| After Habyarimana 's death is when ... two days later is when we went to ETO school . We found the UNAMIR soldiers there . We went there at around 1p.m. When we got there , our houseboy went back home and when he got back , he told us our house had already been burnt . We continued living at ETO , many of the people from Kicukiro , the neighbourhood where we lived . People came to ETO hoping that they 'd survive . A few days later , on April 11th , 1994 is when the UNAMIR soldiers made an announcement from the UN saying that they needed to leave .
Icyo gihe batahanye abazungu n' ababikira bakoraga ahongaho kigo cy' ababikira , barambuka baragenda . Ariko mbere y' uko bagenda barabitubwira bati @: "@ bagiye kugenda . @" Turabimenya .

But before they left , they told us that they were leaving ; so we were aware if that fact . Some tried looking for ways to leave with them but it did n't work out . The Interahamwes were around the fence of Don Bosco High School at ETO , surrounding it . They got in as soon as the UNAMIR left and started killing . A group tried escaping towards Amahoro Stadium but you understand that some were killed at ETO . As we were heading towards Amahoro Stadium , some were killed on the way , in the Kicukiro neighbourhood ... When we got to ‘ Sonatubes ' , there were some GPs [ The Presidential Guard ] and a few Interahamwes , they gathered us all in one place and got us to sit down .
Kubyo numvise bari bamaze kuvuga ko inkotanyi zirimo kutureba ahongaho twari turi kuri Sonatubes . Ariko nta bundi buryo bari bafite bwo kutugeraho . Tumaze kugera ahongaho bareba icyo badukorera barakibura . Ubwo bahita batubwira bati @: "@ ni ugukomeza umuhanda tukajya i Nyanza . @" Turagenda imbere hajya abasirikare tujya hagati n' abandi i nyuma , à côté impande zombi à gauche à droite [ iburyo n' ibumoso ] hari hari interahamwe .

Uhuye n' umuntu agasanga akuzi niba adashaka ko umucika ubwo aragusigarana ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| We heard that the Inkotanyis were seeing us there at ‘ Sonatubes ' but did n't have any means of getting to us . As we were there , they could n't figure out what to do with us and that 's when they told us to continue walking towards Nyanza . We left , some soldiers were walking ahead of us and some behind us and we were in the middle . We walked straight towards Nyanza , those who were tired died on the way . If somebody recognized you and did n't want you to escape him , he 'd take you with him ... and so on .
Noneho tugeze i Nyanza tuhasanga bariyeri , hari hari Interahamwe , baravuga bati @: "@ nta handi twabashyira . @" Kubera ko bari bavuze ko bagomba gukora isuku mu mujyi wa Kigali , nta kwicira ku mihanda . Ariko ubwo ngubwo bahita batubwira ... bwari bumaze no kwira harimo no kugwa imvura , batwishaza hasi , abasirikare bajya hejuru , batangira gutera grénade abantu barahihitana bagwa hasi ahongaho grénade imwe [ éclat ] imfata mu mutwe urumva ko nasaga nk' aho nshitse intege . Noneho abandi grénade zirashira , bararasa birashira nabyo ; noneho babwira interahamwe zari ziri aho ngo binjire batangire kureba abagihumeka noneho ubwo mu kugenda ... ||| We found a roadblock with Interahamwes at Nyanza and they decided that 's where they should put us , given that it had been decided that Kigali city should be kept clean and that they should stop killing people on the streets . It was dark and it was raining ; they got us to sit down and started throwing grenades at us , people were falling all over . A fragment hit my head and I felt very weak . When they got a shortage of grenades , they started shooting until bullets got finished as well . They then told the Interahamwes who were there to get in there and look for the people who were still breathing ...
Grénade bayiguteye hehe ? ||| Where did the grenade hit you ?
Mu mutwe [ yerekana hejuru y' ugutwi ] ||| On the head [ he shows above the ear . ]
Noneho ubwo batangiye gutera...nako grénade zishize n' amasasu , Interahamwe ziraza zitangira kwica bamwe bari bagihumeka . Ariko ubwongubwo urumva ababyeyi banjye , barumuna na bashiki banjye , twari dusa nk' aho twatandukanye . Ariko njyewe nari ndi kumwe na mama icyo gihe . Baje ubwo jyewe nari ndi n' umwana cyane , ariko rero akaza ambwira ngo nsheceke ibintu nk' ibyo ... kuko nari ndimo kumusakuriza .

I mean , after the grenades and bullets got finished , the Interahamwes started killing those who were still breathing . By then , I was no longer with my parents , brothers and sisters . But I was still with mother then . I was still very young and she kept urging me to remain silent . An Interahamwe came and realized she was still breathing . He hit her on the back with a hammer and she was pregnant ! She was in a lot of pain but she did n't die right away . Another one came and hot me with the side of a machete but it was n't very painful compared to the pain caused by the fragment of grenades . The following day ... all this happened at night and I can not recall exactly what happened next but I was told that dad had n't been injured ! So he looked for us and took us not far from Rebero where the Inkotanyis were . The Inkotanyis found us the next day .
Zidushyira mu nzu gutya ahantu hari hari ... inzu y' interahamwe ahongaho . Zitugejejeyo turicara ahongaho , abari bakomeretse bararyama ahongaho .

Agiye mu gikari ahura n' abarimo guteka , arasa umuhungu wari kumwe na papa , icyo gihe ahita apfa . ||| They put us in a house where ... a house that belonged to some Interahamwe nearby . When we got there , we sat and the casualties laid down . The men and women who were n't injured were cooking for the casualties and taking care of them . An Interahamwe came alone , he followed the people who were cooking , he entered and saw many people and quickly took the pin out of a grenade as people were screaming and threw it . It fell on a lady who was near me and she died straight away . The Inkotanyis came by as soon as they heard the greande and the Interahamwes run towards the back . There , he met some people who were cooking and shot a boy who was with my dad and he died right away .
Papa aje kwidefanda [ kwirwanaho ] mu kurwana nawe amurasa ukuboko à droite [ iburyo ] gusa nk' aho kugiye gucika .

He became very weak and fell down but he was still alive . When the Interahamwes came ... I mean the Inkotanyis came and followed him and killed him . They took us to Rebero where there were other people that same evening . All the people from our neighbourhood who had not been injured or who were okay were in that group . Two days later , when the Inkotanyis saw that there were bombs being thrown from the airport , they told us to go to Gishushu where the offices of the Conseil National de Développement [ CND ] were . We got into a Daihatsu and went to CND . The Interahamwes were still throwing bombs there but they did n't know that some Inkotanyis were scattered in the surrounding neighbourhood .
Noneho nibwo abandi baje ... mu kugenda tujya CND twagiye muri Daihatsu , harimo abantu benshi bakomeretse . Ariko rero bagenda basa nk' abarasa iyo daihatsu kuko twari tugiye tukikijwe n' inkotanyi hirya no hino .

Ubwo umuhanda wari muzima , abatakomeretse bagenda n' amaguru , abakomeretse bagenda n' imodoka . ||| Others came ... We left for CND in a Daihatsu full of casualties . They kept on shooting at it as it was surrounded by Inkotanyis . When we got there , the casualties were taken inside where some doctors took care of them . More people came to seek refuge there , the ones who had not been injured brought themselves . Many bombs were being thrown there . Three days later , at around 6 o'clock in the evening , they decided we should ... the non @-@ injured had started walking towards Byumba at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon . The roads were safe , the non @-@ injured went by foot and the casualties were driven there .
Muri uko kugenda papa bakaba bari bamurashe ukuboko , we ntabwo twari turi...nta n' ubwo nari nzi n' aho ari , sauf [ uretse ] njyewe na mama nitwe twari turi kumwe .

He 'd been shot at the hand . I only was with mother . We did n't know in what conditions my younger brothers and sisters were at that time . When we got to Rebero ... that 's when we met with dad at the Byumba hospital , near the Catholic church . Neither did he know where my sisters were which is very understandable . Then ... but soon after we got there , we saw one of my sisters who was 2 years old then . She had been hit with a club on the head and she was with some of our nieghbours . There was a military camp nearby and the soldiers used to bring us food at the hospital . Mother was in a very bad shape as she was pregnant and dad 's hand was almost being cut off . There were some white doctors and he told them he did n't want it to be cut off . He could speak English as he had gone to school .
Ariko kuko nta kundi byari kugenda baraguca . Kandi bavuraga mu buryo bwihuse bashaka kuvura abantu benshi . Baraguca ukuboko kw' iburyo , noneho dusanga barangije kuguca .

They were treating people very fast as there were so many casualties . So when we found out that his right hand had been cut off and we did n't know where all my siblings were , we started seeing how hard life was becoming ... A few days later came some white people , we were with other kids from our neighbourhood and they wanted to take us to Italy . Since those kids were the most injured , they took them first .

We left for Uganda and when we got there , some relatives of ours who lived there welcomed us . A baby boy was born a few days later . The war had ended by then , dad went back to Rwanda to check how things were and he came back and told us the house had been destroyed . We had some neighbours with whom we shared everything who had been killed but their house was still there . Him and I came back to Rwanda but mother , the newly born baby and the child who had been hit by a club remained behind . They later on joined us there and we went back to living a normal life although they were still shooting here and there . After sometime , we moved back to our own house .

We came to find my younger sister called Diane , she was fine and had only been injured on the head , she has a scar on the forehead . We kept looking round and asking about my older sister and we found out that she 'd been killed . She had gone to visit my godmother during the holidays and they all were killed apart from the elder child in my godmother 's family .

I am not saying that they used to just kill people but as time went , we saw things getting worse ; you could pass by somewhere and witness somebody being taken away to be killed in the open . So it was ... it was beyond what one could handle , you 'd reach a point where you 'd become insensible to what was going on.I t was so much that it was as though one had stopped being human .

But after some ... when I was in ... The war started when I was in primary II and when I was in Primary IV is when those Italians took me to Italy twice for a check up . The first time I went , I was operated and then when I went back they did a check up . A bone near the brain had been affected by a fragment and they removed it and said it would get back into place as I was still growing up . We agreed that I 'll go back there after 5 years if necessary so they can implant an artificial bone .

Today he can n't just do any job , we were lucky he was very educated and that allowed him to quickly adjust to this new life . But of course life was much better than it was before the war . 00:27 Manu Do you know how your family members were killed ?

You consider his attitude , the way he usually behaves ... he should be the one to make the first step . He most probably will be thinking that you 're still holding grudges towards him . When you 're still bitter towards him ... he comes to you and tells you in details everything he did and says how sorry he is about it all . He is sorry about it because there is no way it would leave him indifferent and if he were n't , then he would n't come to you . From the heart , you 're then able to tell him that it is okay and even though it will n't resurrect them , at least he 's shown you that he 's become human as opposed to before when he was inhuman ; then you ... you can be united without a problem . But unity will not automatically come , it will be built with time as you talk and keep seeing each other

Yee , mu buzima buzaza ubona urwikekwe ruzashira ? ||| Yes , do you think suspicion will ever stop ?
Urwikekwe ruzagenda rushira gahoro gahoro .

But there are some things you simply can not erase from the heart , some people do n't believe we should live in unity , they can not erase it from their hearts but it will come slowly .
Hashize imyaka icumu mu Rwanda habaye Jenoside...wowe ubona ari iki cyahindutse ... ? ||| It 's been ten years since genocide happened in Rwanda ... what changes do you see ?
Urumva yuko icyenda na gatanu yari [ 1995 ] imeze , siko deux mille [ 2000 @: ibihumbi bibiri ] imeze . Ni ukuvuga y' uko icyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] bwo umutwe wari ugishyushye ibiki byose ... Ureba n' umuntu ukaba ugahita umwikangamo ikindi kintu . Ariko uko imyaka igenda ishira , n' ubuzima bugenda bubaho , niko bisa nk' aho bihindura mu buzima ibyo utekereza ; ibyo wiga . Kuko wenda kwiga bwa mbere byarangoraga kuko wabonaga ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ngahora mbyibuka ndyamye cyangwa ndimo kugenda ahandi hantu . Cyangwa nicaye jyenyine ugasanga ibintu biragenda bigorana . Ariko ubungubu turabiganira , tugasabana numva nko mu muryango wa AERG [ Ishyirahamwe ry' abanyeshuri bacitse ku icumu rya Jenoside ] ni urugero . Abaréscape [ abacitse ku icumu ] muraganira mu bitekerezo , nabo bakakubwira ibindi mukavuga uko mwabayeho mwese . ugasanga iyo mubivuga bifite icyo bigabanuraho mu buzima bwanyu . Ukumva utangiye kuba muri société [ mu bantu ] , ukabaho neza . ||| The way things were in 1995 is not the way they were in 2000 . Everything was still very fresh on people 's minds in 1995 ... You 'd see somebody and immediately suspect him or her of being something else ... But as the years go by and things happen , as life changes , the way we think also changes as we learn new things . Maybe at first I had a problem wih going back to school , I kept remembering wherever I 'd be , while sleeping , walking or sitting on my own and that was a big issue . But today , we talk about it for example in AERG . Survivors exchange ideas and share each other 's experience and it removes a certain weight and one feels lighter . You start living with others in harmony .
Ubona u Rwanda rugana he mu gihe kizaza ? ||| How do you see Rwanda 's future ?

Ubona abana bazaba mu Rwanda mu gihe kizaza , bazaba mu gihugu kimeze gite ... ? ||| What kind of a country do you think the future generations will be living in ?
Mbere y' uko mvuga ngo abana bazaba mu Rwanda rumeze rute...u Rwanda ukundi rumeze ubungubu na mbere urabona harimo différence . Nka mbere hari igice cy' abanyarwanda kigomba kuvuga , n' ikindi kitagomba kuvuga . Ariko ubungubu bisa nk' aho byabaye mixte [ uruvange ] mwese mushobora kuvuga nta kibazo . Usibye utagomba gushyiramo amacakubiri . Mbere hari amacakubiri ukaba utavuga ikintu , mu ndangamuntu harimo ubwoko none ntibukirimo . Noneho ariko ubu avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' u Rwanda uko nyibona , bitewe b' ibyo byarangiye bikaba bigenda isa nk' aho bicika , mbona y' uko bizagera aho bigatera imbere . Nk' abana noneho bazadukomokaho , bazabona archive kuko basoma ibitabo bavuge bati @: "@ byari bimeze gutya , ese kuki byari bimeze gutya . @" Bakabona amakasete , bakavuga bati @: "@ byari byaragenze gutya , ariko noneho ubungubu turabona ubuzima busa nk' aho bwabaye bwiza kurushaho . @" Noneho bavuga bati @: "@ difference [ itandukaniro ] byari muri zero ... none bigeze kuri +15 , cyangwa +20 gutyo . ||| Before I even talk about that , I 'd like to say that today 's Rwanda is very different from the way it used to be . Before , only one part of the Rwandan population could express themselves freely , while another one could n't . But today it seems more open to both sides as long as there are no divisional ideas into it . Before , there was so much division , people 's ethnic groups were written on Identity Cards but today it 's stopped . About the way I see Rwanda 's future , when I look at the things that used to be and that are no longer there , I believe things can only get better . Our children will go through the country 's archives and find out how things used to be and they will want to understand why things were that way . They will also see how things have improved and maybe say that then , things were on level 0 and will maybe be estimating them at +15 or +20 .
Wowe rero ubona hazabaho iterambere ? ||| Do you believe there'll be development ?
Iterambere...ariko noneho iterambere rijyanye n' ubwiyunge , cyangwa se kumvikana hagati y' abantu . Nyuma y' ibyo ngibyo ni ukwihanganirana . Kuko urabona nk' urugero nk' iyo bavuga ngo inkiko gacaca , ushobora kuvuga uti @: "@ abantu barishwe , abandi babura uko babashinja , cyangwa ababashinje barwaye sida barimo no gupfa . Noneho bakazavuga bati @: "@ uyu ntafite umushinja afungurwe . @" Ariko yenda mu murenge hari undi azasanga ku gitanda , arwaye cyangwa ameze ate ... utabonye uburyo bwo kumushinja . Ubwo niba afite umutima w' ubwiyunge bigezweho hagati ye n' uwo muntu ufunguwe mbona iterambere ry' u Rwanda , u Rwanda ruzaba rutera imbere , kuko nta rwikekwe ruzaba ruhari . ||| Development ... But again , development goes hand in hand with unity or with understanding among the people . And then there needs to be tolerance among the people . Because , let 's take the example of the Gacaca jurisdictions , some people were killed , others were charged of murder and maybe the ones accusing them are dying of AIDS ; maybe some of them will be released because there will n't be anyone to charge them . But maybe somewhere in the village , there will be someone else in their deathbed who was unable to go and accuse him . If the charged man really has it at heart to be united with the people he wronged , then he can make a step towards that person and work it out himself . That way , I believe Rwanda will develop because there will n't be any suspicion in the hearts of the people .

I study computers . I have just finished secondary school and I am going on with my studies . A job is something you have to look for , it does n't just come to you . Then life will be good , no one wants to live a bad life .

Ndumva bagomba gutekereza kubyo babonye kuri cassette zitandukanye bazaba babona . ||| The message I 'd like to give them is to look for the message that 's in it when they watch it . That 's the message I 'd like to give them ... I 'd to encourage them to think it through so it never happens again , to keep it in their hearts so that the same thing does n't happen again or we find ourselves in the same situation all over again . I 'd encourage people to think through the different things they 'll see on different recordings .

Ariko bikaba bisa nk' aho birimo kugenda bishira bitewe n' uko abanyarwanda bagenda habaho réconciliation [ ubwiyunge ] . ||| Rwanda is a country inhabited by people called Rwandans . People who have had different lives ... their problem is that there are tribes among them and some of them started killing each other , it 's been acknowledged that genocide occurred . Genocide happened against the Tutsi tribe just like there was genocide against the Jews . The Tutsis in Rwanda were genocided . But now it is coming to an end as Rwandans are reconciling .
Wowe ni iki wita Jenoside , ni iki kigaragaza ko yabayeho ? ||| What do you call genocide ? What proves that it happened according to you ?
Jenoside...jenoside yabayeho . Kubera ko umuntu adashaka ko mugenzi w' ubwoko runaka ... w' ubwoko bw' ubututsi , atamushakira y' uko yabaho . Akumva we atari umuntu . We uko abyumva noneho ikifuzo cye cya mbere ari uko yamuva i ruhande , kumuva iruhande n' ukuvuga y' uko ashaka kumwica . Ku buryo atamubona mu buzima bwe . ||| Genocide ... genocide happened ... Because one does n't want the other one from a different tribe to be alive ... from the Tutsi tribe , he or she does n't want him to be there , he or she does n't consider him or her as a fully @-@ fledged human being . His or her only wish is that the other person would get out of his or her sight and this happens through killing the other person , as that would make it possible never to see him or her again in his or her entire life .

Icyo nakongeraho n' uko , kuba abanyarwanda turiho kandi kuba tubasha no kuyitanga message [ ubutumwa ] , ni uko hari ikintu cyahindutse . Icyo kintu cyahindutse rero , kigomba guhoraho no guhinduka kigatera imbere mu guhinduka . Icyo cyahindutse n' uko ubungubu noneho umuntu ashobora kuvuga . Habaho ubwigenge [ liberté ] , noneho umuntu akavuga ati @: "@ noneho nshobora gukora iki bitabangamiye mugenzi wanjye . @" Noneho muri uko gutera imbere mbona ari ko byaba bimeze . ||| I 'd like to say that the fact that us Rwandans are still alive and able to give out this message shows that there has been a change . That change needs to remain forever and even improve . The change is that people are free to express themselves today . There 's freedom and one can say @: "@ Today , I can do anything without it being harmful to my friend . @" I believe that 's what development is all about .
