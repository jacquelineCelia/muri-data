Twagirango tukubaze uko génocide yatangiye , uko mwahamagawe , uko mwitabiriye , uko wagiye mu bitero cyangwa se uwo waba warabashije gukubita agapfa mbese ukadusobanurira uko wabibonye ||| We would like to ask you what happened during the genocide ; how you were called , how you responded , how you joined the attackers troops or if there is some one you strungled to death , generally tell us how you saw it .
Nitwa Bamporiki Emmanuel , nkaba ntuye mu karere ka nyamata , mu murenge wa kibungo mu ntara ya kigali ngari . Nkaba ndi umugabo wubatse ufite umwana umwe n' umudamu umwe , nkaba mfite imyaka 31 y' amavuko . Nk' umuntu wari utuye ku murenge wa kibungo mbere ... mu ntambara ya 1994 , sinari ndwaye , nari muzima ni ukuvuga ko ibyahabaye byose...hafi ya byose nabikurikiranaga nkamenya ku ijoro n' umunsi uko bimeze . Iriya ntambara yabayeho koko , ndetse nza kuyigiramo uruhare , ndetse yitabirwa n' abantu benshi ; yibasira ubwoko bumwe bw' abatutsi twari duturanye . Ijya gutangira ariko hakaba harabayeho isansilizwa ( sensibiliser ) ku buyobozi bwari ku murenge , ndetse haza kwifashishwa inzego za gisirikare , kuko hari abasirikare bagize uruhare mu kubwira abaturage ngo bitabire ubwicanyi . Ndetse n' inzego za gipolisi kuko hari bamwe na bamwe bari abapolisi z' icyitwaga commune icyo gihe bagaragaye muri ubwo bwicanyi . Ndetse bagaragaye mu gusansibiliza mu baturage , ko umututsi agomba gupfa ndetse byaba ngombwa n' ibyo atunze bikaribwa , kuko nta yindi nkurikizi yari kuzabaho cyangwa ngo bibe byakurikiranwa . Ku ruhande rwanjye ngaruke inyuma gatoya rero . Nk' umunyarwanda wari utuye hafi aho ngaho , ku itariki ya 09/04/1994 kuri uyu murenge wa kibungo ahanini niho ubwicanyi bwatangiye , kuko nibuka ko umugabo umwe wari utuye hafi ahangaha , niho yasenyewe amazu yitwaga Ndengeyinka icyo gihe aranatotezwa . Noneho ku itariki ya 10/04/1994 birakomeza , ubwo abaturage bo kuri uyu murenge bamwe na bamwe babifashijwemo n' abo bayobozi bari bafite intwaro za gisirikare navuze haruguru , bagabye ... twagabye igitero , ahantu kuri centre ya Nyarunazi . Icyo gitero kigwamo abantu benshi , ndetse ndibukamo amazina ya bamwe , harimo umuturage wari uhatuye witwa Ndekezi , uwitwa Bikino , uwitwa sango ; n' uwitwa Rubangisa . Bigaragare rero ko abaturage bari bamaze gucengerwa n' ubwicanyi koko by' ukuri ; ndetse bazi ikibajyanye , kuko bagendaga bazi ikibajyanye ko kwari uguhiga umututsi . Ntibyaciriye aho rero , ku itariki 14/04/1994 nibwo i Ntarama ku kiliziya , twagabyeyo igitero gikomeye cyane . Ariko mbere yo kugira ngo kigabweyo habanje kuba ihurirana ry' masegiteri yari agose Ntarama ; n' ukuvuga Kibungo , Kanzenze , Rurindo na Musenyi . Ndetse yemwe n' abavuye mu nkengero z' aka karere , ndetse yemwe n' abavuye mu zindi ntara . Navuga nk' abaturage bavaga mu ntara ya Gitarama , abavuye mu cyahoze ari commune Kanombe , mu cyahoze ari commune Butamwa nkiri Kigali ngari , n' abandi benshi baturutse hirya no hino . Byabaye ngombwa rero ko dukusanyirizwa hafi ya ntarama , duyobowe n' umu ajida witwaga Sebuhindo wari utuye ahantu ku kanzenze . Twagezeyo rero i Ntarama kuri izo tariki cumi n' enye , ndumva mbyibuka neza nk' umuntu wari uhibereye , cumi n' enye z' ukwezi kwa kane . Abantu , abacitse ku icumu ... abitwa abacitse ku icumu iki gihe , n' ukuvuga abari abatutsi icyo gihe ari nabo bahigwaga , benshi bari buzuye muri iyo kiliziya arimo bahungiye . Bamwe mu bapolisi bari barimo muri icyo gitero twagabye yo , ndetse n' abasirikari twari kumwe bari bafite intwaro zikomeye ; barabanje bazishinga hafi y' ahegereye kiliziya imbunda zirasa kure , babanza guteramo ibisasu . Ntibyaciriye aho rero twaramanutse kuri uwo munsi tugerayo , tugera i Ntarama ku kiliziya , byumvikana ko ibyo bisasu byari byishe bamwe muri bo bari barahungiyemo . Batangiye gutatana bavuyemo bamwe bari hepfo abandi haruguru abandi biruka birumvikana bari batewe . Twarahageze abatapfuye tukabica , abandi bagatemagurwa abandi bagakubitwa ubuhiri , mbese muri rusange abanyarwanda bari bihishe muri icyo gihe b' abatutsi barishwe ku buryo bugaragara , ku buryo bitari ibanga . Nanjye rero nk' umunyarwanda wari wahageze nitabiriye ubwicanyi , nta kindi cyari cyanjyanye byumvikane . N' ubwo hariho ubuyobozi bwari bwanjyanye , ariko bigaragara ko nagezeyo , ndetse nkagira uruhare kugeza ubwo nabifungiwe imyaka itandatu . Mfungiwe ko aho ngaho i Ntarama nahishe umuntu w' umusaza mukubise ubuhiri muri icyo gitero nagiyemo . Noneho birangiye intambara ibaye nk' ihagaze ho gatoya habaho ihunga , duhungutse ubuyobozi twasanze mu gihugu buramfunga , banyagiriza ko nari naragiye ahongaho i Ntarama . Mbyemera nk' umunyarwanda wagiye yo koko , ngaragaza ukuri kw' icyaha nakoze ntagiciye ku ruhande , ndetse ngaragaza n' abo twagifatanyije . Ngamije kugirango ukuri kugaragare , kuko kuba abantu barapfuye barishwe kandi bicwa n' abandi banyarwanda , byari ngombwa rero ko ngaragaza uruhare rwanjye . Nk' ubu rero nicaye ahangaha nk' umuntu waciye imbere y' ubutabera , ariko mbuca imbere nirega nemera icyaha cyanjye nakoze , ndetse ngaragaza n' abo twagifatanyije . Nza guca imbere y' urukiko rumpa igahano cy' imyaka irindwi , kugeza kuri iyi saha narakirangije ; nafunguwe na ririya tangazo rya perezida wa Repubulika , ariko mfungurwa n' igihano narakirangije . Gusa bitavuze y' uko nibagiwe icyaha nakoze cy' uko naba nakubise impiri umusaza umwe mu gitondo nari ndimo i Ntarama ahongaho . Nkamwica , nkabifungirwa nkabisabira imbabazi . Nkaba niteguye isaha n' isaha kugaragaza ukuri kw' icyaha nakoze . Kuko ahanini nta kindi namarira ubutabera uretse kubwereka ukuri ku byabaye nk' umunyarwanda wari uhibereye . ||| My name is BAMPORIKI EMMANUEL I live in NYAMATA DISTRICT in KIBUNGO SECTOR in the PROVINCE of KIGALI rural . I am married and I have one child , and I am 31 years old . I witnessed every thing that took place in Kibungo . I followed up whatever happened during the day and in the night in that area in 1994 . It is true that there was a war in 1994 and I must admit that I participated in this war with other different people with the object of killing Tutsis and finishing them completely . But before that , the local leaders had sensitized the locals to participate in the killing together with the help of the soldiers , who were later joined by the policemen in the sensitisaton . All those leaders tried to persuade citizens to kill Tutsis . And if anything , to destruct all their properties and they assured us that no one would accuse us or follow up their cases . I will start by telling you what happened in that area . Generally the massacre started on the 9th . If I remember well it is when Ndengeyeinka 's house was destroyed . They even tortured him . On the 10th the massacre continued . Some villagers from this area , together with the help of soldiers , attacked a certain centre called Nyarunazi . So many people lost their lives in that attack . I can remember some of their names . There was Ndekezi , Bikino , Sango and Rubangiza . In that time you could see that people knew what they were doing and they did it with all their efforts . It did not stop there , on the14th April in 1994 . That was when we attacked Ntarama at the church . But before we went there , we held a meeting with people who lived in the sectors that surrounded Ntarama that is ; Kibungo , Kanzenze , Rurindo , Musenyi , people from other neighbouring districts like ; Gitarama district , Kanombe and Butamwa commune plus so many other people from here and there . We had to meet in one place near Ntarama , led by a policeman called Subuhindo who used to live in KANZENZE . I remember very well that we arrived there on the14th . Most of the TUTSI who were being hunted had fled to that church . Most of the soldiers and policemen we were with started planting bombs around the church and throwing grenades in the church . We did not stop there , but we also went and entered the church . We found that some had already died because of the bombs . So we started killing others using machetes , clubs . Honestly one has to say that . That time the TUTSIS were killed very harshly and the truth must be said . I was also there with the intension of killing and I should say that I also participated and I killed an old man using a club . For that reason I was imprisoned for six years . After all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile . When we returned the country I was imprisoned by the current government because I had participated in the massacre that took place in MURAMBI . Later , I admitted and I said the truth on what I did in MURAMBI and the people I was with . I had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow RWANDANS , so I felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it . I was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but I had already admitted and I had said the truth on what happened and the people I was with and I was released after that rule that was given by the president . But it does not mean that I have forgotten what I did . I remember very well that I killed that old man on that morning when I was in NTARAMA and I am always ready to say the truth of what happened in NTARAMA .
Uretse icyo gitero cy' i Ntarama nta bindi bitero waba warigeze witabira ? ||| Besides the Ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ?
Uretse icyo gitero cy' i Ntarama ntabwo aricyo cyonyine ubwo ni bibiri , hari ikindi gitero nabanje kuvuga cy' i Nyarunazi centre nabanje kuvuga cyaguyemo bari bantu navuze imbere , haruguru ; n' icyo gitero cy' i Ntarama ku kiliziya . Ubwo ni ibitero bibiri nagaragayemo . Mu by' ukuri mu gitero cy' i Nyarunazi nta ruhare nagize mu kwica umuntu , ariko nagize uruhare mu bufatanyacyaha bwa sensibilisation , ni ukuvuga ngo gutera ingufu abandi . Ni ukuvuga ngo niba umuntu aciye hariya nkaba naramuhize undi akamukubita ubuhiri , ahanini ninjye uba waramwishe . Ibyo rero kubyirega ni byiza kuko wenda iyo ntahagarara hariya , yari kuhamenera agahita agahunga . Ariko kuba nari mpahagaze byagaragara nk' umwicanyi . Gusa uruhare rwanjye narugize i Ntarama kumugaragaro , ubwo nicaga uwo muntu mukubise ubuhiri . ||| that centre , but I participated by giving them support like bringing back people who were trying to escape and others would kill them . But I believe that I would also have killed them myself if the people I sent them to had not killed them . I should admit I did terrible things by stopping these people maybe if I had not stopped them they would have escaped and be able to survive . I still admit that I participated in the genocide in public and killed someone using a club .
Bigaragara y' uko ibyo ari byo byose ibitero byabaye byinshi , ariko wemera ko...ko witabiriye ibitero bibiri gusa , icy' i Ntarama ni icy' i Nyarunazi kubera iki ibindi utabyitabiraga ? ||| It 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . But you participated in only two ; that of Ntarama and Nyarunazi . Why did n't you participate in several others ?
Muri ako gace dutuyemo ibitero byahabaga ntabwo byaterwaga mu ngo duturanye , ahubwo habagaho ikusanywa ry' abaturage , riganisha aho abantu benshi birunze . Ni ukuvuga ngo abatutsi twari duturanye benshi bavuye mu ngo zabo bahungira i Ntarama , bahahurira n' abandi bagiye baturuka mu turere two hirya no hino mu mirenge igize akarere ka Nyamata , bakusanyirizwa i Ntarama . Byabaye ngombwa rero ko kujya kubatera twabaga turi ikipe ishyitse , kugirango twegerane tubone ukuntu tugaba igitero gikomeye . Muri ubwo buryo rero muri uyu murenge nta bitero byinshi byahabaye . Uretse igitero kindi nibuka ntagiyemo nakurikiranye ubuhamya bwacyo n' ukuntu cyaba cyarakozwe , cy' ahantu bita mu Bironda hariya muri cellule ya Rusekera cyo ntabwo nakigiyemo . Nicyo gitero kindi cyabaye ku murenge . Naho ibindi byose twavaga aha tugahurira i Ntarama tugamije kujya kwica abantu bari bari i Ntarama . ||| In the area where we lived , we never used to attack homes in the same area . Instead local attackers would be deployed in an area where many people had gathered . What does this mean ... ? The Tutsi whom we were neighbours , left there homes and went to Ntarama plus many other people who had come from different sectors that make up Nyamata district . They all gathered up in Ntarama . Therefore in order to attack them , we had to first make a sufficient team . And verify if we were strong enough to attack . As a result , there were few attacks in my area . However , there was another attack that I followed it 's stories and I know how it started although I never joined it . That was in a place called Bironda in Rusekera cell . That is the only other attack that took place in this sector . The rest of the attackers would gather from Ntarama with an aim of killing people in Ntarama .
Uriya musaza waba wari...warabashije...warishe , waba warigeze umenya uwo ari we ? ||| Did you know the old man you killed ?
Mu byukuri i Ntarama ... ntabwo namenye uwo ari we . Impamvu ntamenye uwo ari we , i ntarama hahungiye abantu benshi cyane . Kandi mu by' ukuri abantu bari bahari ntabwo nabashije kuba wenda ... sinzi ko hari n' uwahunganaga indangamuntu kuburyo wamukora mu mufuka wenda umaze no kumwica . Yenda ushobora no kwishakira udufaranga . Ushobora kumwica wamara kumwica ukaba wakora mu mufuka ugirango urebe ikigutunga birashoboka . Ariko ibyo ntibyabayeho wenda ngo mbe naramenye ; ni naka w' i bunaka habagaho kwica gusa . Kubera ko intego yari ukumaraho ntabwo....gushaka ibyangombwa ntabwo byari bifite agaciro , agaciro byari ukwica umuntu tu . Kubera ko wari wo mugambi . ||| Sincerely speaking in Ntarama ... I never knew who it was . And the reason why I did know him , in Ntarama several people gathered there ... To be sincere , they were very many and I guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there Identity cards for one to tell who was who . Well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the ID to know who was who or where he was coming from . The main theem was killing . And our motto was to finish the ethenic of Tutsi ... looking for Ids by then , was nosense . Point was in killing only because that was the deal .
Nta mpamvu wumva yaba yarabaye mbere ya génocide , ukurikije y' uko ubutegetsi bwari buriho bwashishikarizaga abantu ikintu cy' amacakubiri , ku buryo nawe waba wari ufite akantu gato k' urwango ku bwoko bw' abatutsi igihe ... ? ||| Do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations . To the extend that , if one had a bias in the Tutsi would ... ?
Ubundi nkurikije iriya ntambara nk' umuntu wabikurikiye kandi narinshiye akenge nari mukuru . Abantu twari duturanye twabanaga mu mahoro nta rwango nari mfitiye abatutsi , kuko twari tumaranye imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe y' amavuko , twari tubanye mu mahoro . Gusa bijya gukomera intandaro urebye yo kugirango abantu bapfe aha ahantu dutuye , igihe havugwaga ko Habyarimana yaba yapfuye inzangano zahereye kuri uwo munsi cyane cyane . Ugasanga bari udututsiko ubundi abandi mbese akoba kaje mu baturage . Noneho kubera ko abanyarwanda benshi bumvaga ko bakunze umubyeyi wabo , ndetse n' ubuyobozi bukabigiramo uruhare bakumvikanisha ngo perezida wanyu yapfuye kandi yishwe n' abatutsi ni uguhaguruka rero namwe mukamurengera . Kubw' ibyo rero njye nta rwango nari mfitiye abatutsi , gusa intandaro yabaye igihe gito cyane kijyanye n' iryo hanuka ry' indege ya Habyarimana bavuga ko yapfuye . Urebye niho gupfa kwabo kwagize ingufu , gusansibilizwa kwabo kugirango bicwe abayobozi babigizemo ingufu cyae cyane aho Habyarimana apfiriye ||| If I consider that war ... as a person who followed up everything yet I was mature by then . We live in peace with our neighbours . I did not have any hatred for TUTSIS because I had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years . But the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of HABYARIMANA . We sensed segregation among people that particular day . People started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at TUTSIS as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the TUTSIS . And so you should stand up and defend him .
Watubwiye ko ubu ufite imyaka 31 bishaka kuvuga yuko mu gihe cya génocide wari ufite imyaka 21 kuko imyaka 10 irashize . Ese mu gihe cya mbere ya génocide higeze kubaho ibihe by' amashyaka ; waba wari uri murihe shyaka ? Iby' amashyaka wabyumvise gute nk' umuntu w' umusore wari ugifite imbaraga wumvaga ushobora kwitabira ibintu nk' ibyo byari bifite imbaraga mu gihugu ? ||| You have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . That means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed . Well before the Genocide there used to be several political parties . Can you tell us the one you belonged to ? How did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ?
Ubundi nk' umuntu w' umusore icyo gihe nari mfite uburenganzira busesuye , ndetse ndumva nta n' itegeko ryambuzaga kujya mu ishyaka nk' umunyarwanda . Abanyarwanda benshi bari mu mashyaka birumvikana , ndagirango mvuge ko n' uyu munsi njyewe nibuka ko nari mu ishyaka M.D.R. , ndaryibuka ariko ndirimo nk' umunyarwanda usanzwe . Kuko nta mashuri ngira sini...ndetse nta n' undi mwanya nari ndifitemo gusa nari mfite i karita y' umurwanashyaka wa M.D.R. Kugeza kuri iyi saha rero M.D.R. twari turimo mu by' ukuri ntiyakundaga abatutsi . Urumva ? Gusa haruguru nabanje kukubwira ko nta rwango nari mfitiye abatutsi , ariko cya gihe cy' amashyaka ari nayo ntandaro y' intambara , amashyaka amwe n' amwe yagendaga yigisha abayoboke bayo ko umwanzi ari umututsi aho ava akagera . ||| Yes I was old enough to join any party I wanted to join and by then I was a member of MDR. I was there as any other Rwandan , and because I was illiterate ; I could not get any good post . Therefore , I simply had a membership card for that party . But what I know is , that party disliked the TUTSIS so much . I had told you that I did not have any hatred for TUTSIS . But most of these parties always taught us that the only enemy we had was a TUTSI .
Nonese ku bw' umwihariko M.D.R ako kantu kaba karasaga nakagutera ku mutima wenda ko nubwo utanze umututsi ariko umututsi atari mwiza , hari ako yaba yarigeze ku kwigisha mu buryo buziguye cyangwa butaziguye ? ||| Though you did not have any hatred for the TUTSIS . When MDR was teaching you how TUTSIS were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ?
Gusa ntabwo M.D.R ntabwo nigeze njya mu manama yayo menshi cyane . Gusa nibuka ko uwari uyihagarariye witwaga Sebuningo Oswald wari utuye hano muri uyu murenge wa Kibungo , yigeze gukoresha meeting hano kuri centre ya kibungo , atwigisha amatwara y' ishyaka atubwira intego zaryo n' umugambi w' ishyaka n' iki byose . Ariko bigaragara yuko byanze bikunze hari uruhande ribogamiyemo kuko ryagushaga ku kintu bita ngo hutu . Iyo hutu iyo habayeho kuvangura ubwoko ubu n' ubu , urumva ko hari ubundi buhejwe budafite ijambo muri icyo gihe . Bigaragara ko byanze bikunze amashyaka yaba yaragize uruhare mu gutegura iriya intambara , no mu kuyigisha mu bari abayoboke bayo . ||| I did not attend most of MDR meetings . But I remember some time when Sebuningo Oswald ; he was the representative of the party in Kibungo sector . He held a meeting at Kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto . But one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . And the whole meeting was about the "@ Hutu . @" Therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights . Thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide .
Mu gihe cya génocide se icyo kintu cy' amashyaka mwakibonaga mute ? ||| During the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ?
Mu gihe cya génocide muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] hariho amashyaka yari afite ingufu , navuga nk' ishyaka ryari ririho rya M.R.N.D , ndibuka n' ishyaka C.D.R.rigaragara nk' ishami rya M.R.N.D urebye nayo yari nka M.R.N.D y' icyo gihe ; urebye ayo mashyaka niyo yarafite ingufu zikomeye kuburyo mu gihugu ariyo yarafite ijambo rikaze mu yandi mashyaka yari ariho icyo gihe . ||| During that time of year 1994 , there were many political parties but some were more powerful than others were . For example MRND and CDR. CDR was like a branch of MRND . Those were the most power parties in the country and they had imposed others in the country .
Biragaragara y' uko wowe uri mu bantu bemeye icyaha , ndetse ukaba uri n' umuyobozi mu bantu biyemeje kuvugisha ukuri ku bintu byabaye . Icyo gihe mu bitero byabaye hariya i Ntarama haguye abantu benshi , ku buryo twibaza wowe ku giti cyawe waba ufite abantu washinje mu bantu bakoze ubwicanyi bw' aho i Ntarama ? ||| We know that you are one of the people who admit that they killed and you are ready to say the truth on what happened in NTARAMA . Are there some of the people you were with in NTARAMA that you accused ?
Nsubiye haruguru gatoya kiriya gitero cy' i Ntarama cyo ku itariki 15/04/1994 cyari igitero gikomeye kandi cyari igitero cyaguyemo abanyarwanda ... abantu benshi cyane . Abanyarwanda bose bari barimo bihishe muri icyo kiliziya ndumva nta wavuyemo . Ahari n'wavuyemo ni ku bwa nyagasani sinzi uburyo yaba yararokotsemo , cyaguyemo abantu benshi cyane kitabirwa n' abantu benshi . Nk' aha ntuye nk' umuntu wahavukiye ntawe nyobewe izina , benshi mubo twagiye tujyana nagenda ngaragaza nk' amazina yabo . Abo nibuka nk' uwo nashinje witwa Sehene Sylivestre twaburaniye rimwe mu idosiye mfite naburaniyeho , ubu nawe yaraburanye yarakatiwe . Ndibuka uwitwa Sindikubwabo Gilbert , uwo nawe twari kumwe nawe yiyemerera ibyaha bye yakoreye aho ngaho . Ndibuka uwitwa Karangwa Charles uwo nawe twari turi kumwe n' abandi banyarwanda benshi batuye hafi ahangaha biyemerera icyaha , uretse ko wenda batabonye umwanya wo kugira icyo bavuga . Ariko nashinje benshi kandi noneho icyaha baracyemera kuko bageze aho ngaho ndetse bagaragaza uruhare rwabo . Ku bw' ibyo rero ntabwo icyaha nka kiriya naba naragikoze njyenyine , kandi niyo naba narindi kumwe n' abandi si ngombwa kugirango mbahishire . Ikigamijwe n' ukuri uwo bishe nta wundi musanzu natanga uretse kugaragaza ukuri k' ukuntu yishwe n' uko nabigenje . Kuko igihe cy' intambara sinahigwaga nari mfite uburenganzira bwose nk' umunyarwanda w' icyo gihe . Kuvuga ukuri rero ku byabaye ni ngombwa , dore ko abanyarwanda bari muri iki gihugu abenshi ni abari ba...abarokotse nabo nta kuri guhagije bafite kuko icyo gihe barahigwaga . Abandi n' abanyarwanda agiye baturuka hanze y' igihugu . Nabo bakeneye amakuru kandi nta handi bayakura uretse kuyabwirwa natwe abanyarwanda twari mu gihugu icyo gihe . Ndetse amahirwe akaboneka mu gihe hari uwiyemereye icyaha nkanjye uzi ukuri koko ku byabaye . Nkababwira ukuri ku byo nakoze , ku byo nemera , ku bo twafatanije ndetse no kubindi byose bijyanye n' itsembabwoko ryabaye kuri uyu murenge . ||| The troop that attacked Ntarama was very big and so powerful and I should say many people died in that attack . I do n't even think that there was anyone who survived . In case there is one , it would have been through God 's mercy . I remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking Ntarama . I accused Sehene Siriveste , Sindikubwabo Gilbert , Karangwa Charles , they all admit that they killed . Plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something . But I accused so many people and that shows that I was not alone . And I realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing I can do to pay the fine of what I did . During the war I was not being hunted . So , I was free as a Rwandan . Therefore , I witnessed whatever happened and I feel that I should say the truth about what happened . Because the majority of Rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . And survivors do not know everything because they were hunted . Others are Rwandans who came from exile . They were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . The only alternative is us who were free by then . And fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector .
Hariho ikintu cyo gusaba imbabazi no kwemera icyaha nyine . None nagirango nkubaze , kuko hari abantu biciwe abantu ariko batazi ababishe . Icyo kintu mwaba mutekereza gute uko cyakorwa mu buryo bwo gusaba imbabazi nk' abantu barokotse mu mwanya....kuko nabo barahemukiwe muri icyo kintu ; wowe hari icyo waba waragerageje gukora wenda gusaba imiryango y' abarokotse baba bari muri aka gace imbabazi . ||| There is some thing we call ; "@ asking for forgiveness @" and what we call "@ admitting what you did . @" Therefore , I would like to ask you about the survivor ; there are some survivors who do not know those who killed their relatives , and though they survived , they are always hurt about what happened to their people . I would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? Have you ever asked them to forgive you ?
Abantu barokotse bahuye na ririya tsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba bakarirokoka bahuye n' ibibazo bikomeye cyane . Barahizwe bikomeye cyane , ndetse bicirwa ababo , ku buryo biteye agahinda .

Byabaye ngombwa ko nsaba imbabazi ndirega nsaba imbabazi ubutabera , n' abanyarwanda bose muri rusange . Ariko by' umwihariko nagendaga mpura n' abanyarwanda bamwe n' abamwe aho nari mfungiye bazaga kudusura mu magereza . Barimo uwitwa Rwililiza Innocent ndumva ahari mu muzi . Gutyo akagaragara nk' uhagarariye abacitse ku icumu ku murenge , natwe tukamubwira ibitekerezo byacu ko tudufite umugambi wo gusaba imbabazi abo twahemukiye , dufunzwe twemera icyaha , dusaba n' imbabazi . Ariko noneho gahunda ya Leta iriho kuri ubungubu n' ubwo ntashoboye kubona umuryango w' uwo muntu naba narishe hari icyo bita gacaca . Gacaca rero duteganya yuko mu gihe kiri imbere gitoya aho leta izapangira gahunda y' uko igiye gutangira , ko tuzicara , tugafata imiryango y' ingo zahigwagwa ituye ku murenge , nta na umwe tutazi urugo ku rundi . Tuvuga ngo abantu bari muri uru rugo bagiye hehe ? Tugakora ikintu kimeze nk' ibarura nta rugo rusigaye . Ababashije kuboneka muri bo tukagenda tubabwira uko twagiye tubakorera ibyaha . Uko abana babo bagiye bapfa ; abo twagiye tuba ... navuga ko ari nko kubajugunya kuko nta wahambwaga icyo gihe . Tuhagaragaza bagashobora gushyingurwa mu cyubahiro , bityo bigatuma nibura nubwo umuntu we yapfuye , ariko akumva yuko koko ufite ubushake bwo kumubwira uko ibintu byagenze utamukinze . ||| It is true that those people faced horrible things and they lost their people , which is very sad . Personally I do not know the family of the person I killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families I decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general . But we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like RWIHEZA INNOCENT . He was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector . We would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise . But the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ Gacaca level . @" In Gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ I am sure we know family per family ] . Then we will count . It would be more or less like a census . Then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies . Well I can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried . Hence they exhume and rebury them officially . In that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything .
Agira agahinda ko kuba yarapfushije umuntu , noneho yagira agahinda ko kuba yarabuze irengero rye akarushaho kugira agahinda . Twiteguye tudashidikanya ko muri gacaca ejo bundi , tuzicara nk' abanyarwanda ahanini twaburanye n' ubwo twashyize ukuri ahagaragara . Tuzagaragaza ukuri ku byabaye , tukabibwira abantu barokotse tukabasaba imbabazi zibaho zose , ko icyaha cyabaye tudashobora kongera kugikora no kugitekereza . Tubagaragariza ukuri ku bantu babo ukuntu bishwe , abashoboye kumenyekana aho bashyizwe tukahabereka . Abo tutazi ubu nyine ... wenda hari benshi bagiye bagwa hirya no hino , ariko byibura tukabahumuriza twifashishije ukuri . Ukuri nta kundi rero n' ukugenda tugaragaza ibyo bintu twakoze bikajya ahagaragara ntibibe ubwiru ngo babe barafunguye umuntu bavuga ngo warireze n' ugera hanze kubera ko wibereye ... utangire kwigirira umunezero wo hanze ngo wibagirwe ikintu cyatumye ufungurwa . Turi tayari rero kuzagaragaza ukuri muri Gacaca . ||| On behalf of the servivors , it is agony to loss their beloved ones . And when they add on not knowing where those people died , it hurts a lot . In the Gacaca corts that are going to take place in the next few months , we planned to come together as Rwandans and say the whole truth about what happened . We will tell the truth to the survivors and we will pread for forgiveness as much as we can . The crime we committed we will never do it or think about it again . We will tell them the truth about all the people we killed and how they were killed . Those whom we still remember where they were dumped , we will show them to those who survived . And those that we do n't remember ; because they are some who died from here and there . But we shall use "@ saying the truth @" as our weapon to calm them . Saying the truth is nothing much rather than showing people what we did and put everything in open . We have to avoid keeping it as a secrete believing that once you are released from prison , you are going to enjoy out there forgetting the main reason why you were released . We are ready to say the truth in Gacaca .
Ubona gute abantu basa n' aho bapfobya génocide yabaye , bahakana ibyaha cyangwa se basa n' abanakina no ku mubyimba ku bantu ba ... barokotse génocide ? ||| What do you feel about people who criticise the Genocide . People who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of Genocide ?
Kugera kuri uyu munsi hariho abanyarwanda bafata itsembabwoko nk' aho ari imirwano isanzwe , imwe ihuza umuntu n' undi wenda bamaze kunywa , bakarwana wenda bakaba bakwicana . Bakaripfobya bakavuga ko ritanabayeho . Njye rero nk' umunyarwanda wari mu gihugu itsembabwoko ndyemera nk' iryabayeho . Ntabwo ndisubiza inyuma . Bariho rero ubwira uti @: ' nyamuneka dore abantu barapfuye , ' bakaba bavuga ngo ni ugusubiranamo . Abanyarwanda barahizwe , noneho byongeye hahigwa ubwoko bumwe baricwa buratotezwa . Kugera kuri uyu munsi abayobozi bakomeye bariho icyo gihe babigiramo uruhare . Bamaze kubigiramo uruhare na n' uyu munsi ntibabyemera ko byabayeho . Kandi twebwe abo bayoboraga babajyanye hiryo no hino aho ngaho tubyemera nk' ukuri , tubifitiye inyandiko mvugo twakoze zigaragaza ko itsembabwoko ryabaye . Abantu bapfobya rero itsembabwoko n' ugusubiza igihugu inyuma , nta wundi musanzu bamarira igihugu , uretse kugisubiza inyuma .

Nkaba numva ku bwanjye abo bantu bakina abacitse ku icumu ku mubyimba bavuga ko ibyabaye ntacyo bimaze , abo ngabo rwose ni abashinyaguzi . Nibasigeho kuko ibyabaye biteye agahinda . Ahubwo bafate ingamba , barebe ukuntu bakwegera abandi banyarwanda bavuga ukuri , bagende babacengezemo ukuri kw' ibyabaye n' ukuntu byagiye bigenda . Bumve ko umuntu atibeshyera niba warireze wireze ibyo wakoze ntabwo ... nta munyarwanda ufite umugambi wo kwibeshyera ngo bigire icyo bimugezaho . Ni ukuvuga ngo rero itsembabwoko ryarabaye . Ahasigaye dushyire ukuri ahagaragara , kandi tubwire n' abo bose bavuga ko ritabayeho ko ryabaye .

A fight like that between two drunkards who start it up and maybe one of them dies . The same people say that there was no genocide . I as a Rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , I admit that there was genocide in Rwanda . I do n't deny it . Yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" And they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @" One group of Rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed . Up to this day leaders in the former government are behind it . Yet those of us they were leading in different places by then , admit it as a truth that Genocide happened here . We have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was Genocide . Those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country . There is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her . We admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light . As a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful . Instead they should unit together with the Rwandans who are ready to say the truth . And together tell people what happened and how it happened . They should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime . This means that , there was Genocide . Then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there . Preach them how it took place repeatedly . But not keeping quiet about it . Until when everyone will learn that Genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country .
Urakoze hari ikindi kintu numva nshaka kukubaza , ku bantu bashobora kuba barakoze itsembabwoko kandi bakaba bakiri hanze . Wenda ushobora we ku giti cyawe kuba ntabo uzi , ariko ntabo waba uzi wenda bashinjwa ubungubu bakaba bakidegembya ndetse hano hanze muri iki gihugu ? ||| Thanks a lot . I would like to ask you about those who participated in the Genocide yet they are not imprisoned . You may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ?
Eeh nk' ubungubu mpagaze ahangaha , nko ku idosiye yanjye mfate urugero hari abanyarwanda benshi .... abantu benshi twagiye dufatanya , batigeze bagera muri gereza ngo bafungirwe icyaha bakoze . Bari hanze koko bamwe na bamwe , ndumva mbibuka . Iyo ambonye koko ubona agize akantu kuko aribuka . Akavuga ati @: « uriya muntu nubwo agenda bwose twakoranye icyaha kandi we yaragifungiwe , yagize n' amahirwe yenda arafungurwa . » Ukabona ko afite akantu ko gutinya yuko byanze bikunze igihe kizagera , igihe cye nawe kikagera akavuga agashyirwa ahagaragara ; kuko sinzamuhishira niyo yaba ari papa nta mugambi mfite wo guhishira itsembabwoko . Ku bw' ibyo rero abo bantu bakiri hanze bidegembya , urukiko gacaca rwagiyeho mu gihugu cyose , kandi rutanga uburenganzira bw' uko uwaba wiyiziho icyaha nk' icyo yagombye kukigaragaza hakiri kare . Kugirango urukiko nirutangira ruzamugirire imbabazi rukurikije ko yabivuze mbere , nabo bagombye kugira ikintu k' ishyaka , bakumva ko kuvuga ukuri bitavuga ngo n' ukwica umuntu . Iyaba aribyo iyi leta y' ubumwe iriho yari gufata uwishe nawe akicwa , ariko siko byagenze ahubwo byabaye ngombwa ko uzi ikintu akivuga akagitangaho n' ubuhamya . Kuvuga rero génocide ntabwo ari ukuvuga ngo umuntu yarishe gusa , dukeneye byinshi , dukeneye ubuhamya , dukeneye ukuri . Kuba rero warishe umuntu ugomba kubigaragaza , ariko no kuba waramwishe ukaba ukidegembya mu gihugu kandi ubizi neza ko hari abo mwakoranye icyaha , nabyo bigaragaza ko ugishyigikiye itsembabwoko . ||| Yes there are there . Up to this moment in my document I mentioned so many Rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed . Some of them are out there and I remember them . When they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily . "@ Though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did . He is lucky he was released . @" That is what they say . One can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . And it is true their time will come and they will be put in open . Because I will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . I do n't intend to hide the Genocide . Therefore , those who are still out there , I would like to remind them that Gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime . Those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . But they should also have the courage to say the truth . Saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed . If it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true . Instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did . Therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only . There is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth . So , you killed some one you better say it . Because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the Genocide .
Muri abo bantu nta bantu b' abayobozi cyangwa se wabona yuko batari mu cyiciro cy' abaturage , nkamwe mwari abaturage basanzwe bata .... ||| Among those people , do n't you know some who are leaders nowor those who are not at the same level with the locals ? For example people like you who were locals say that ...
Abayobozi barimo , ndetse cyane cyane nakubwiye ngitangira ko urwego rwa gisirikare iyo umuntu ari mu rwego rw' adjudant chef burya aba ari umuyobozi . Hari nk' uwitwa Sebuhindo sinzi igihugu yahungiyemo . Nakubwira burya na police burya nawe aba ari umuyobozi mu gihe afite intwaro , igihugu cyamuhaye imyenda y' akazi kikamuha imbunda . Uwitwa bwana Bizimungu Isaac ubu ari Ririma nawe n' umuyobozi . Nkibuka bwana Inspecteur Karerangabo Vincent nawe yari umuyobozi inspecteur ni umuntu uba ukomeye kandi aba yarize azi ubwenge . Noneho nkibuka ... ||| There are some who are leaders . In the beginning I gave you an example of the cops . When someone is at the level of [ adjudant chef ] is already a leader . I know of someone called Sebuhindo , but I do n't know where he is now . Even policemen are leaders in a country because they are armed . Mr Bizimungu Issac who is in RIRIMA at the moment . He is also a leader . I remember inspector Karerangabo Vincent . He was also a leader and educated . I even remember ...
Ubu arafunze ? ||| Was he arrested ?
Oya ntawe uzi iyo yahungiye . Uwo narinzi wundi ... abandi bagiye bapfa , undi uriho ukidegembya dusangiye n' idosiye , navuga ko ari nk' umuyobozi w' akagari muri iki gihe we ari hanze . Uwo turahura tukaganira ariko iwe yarahahunze ntahaba aho amariye gufungurwa . ||| No , nobody knows where he fled . The other people that I knew died . but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area . We normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released .
Afunguwe yahise agenda ? ||| After being released he disappeared ?
Yego , yahise ajyenda . ||| Yes , he disappeared .
Ubu yahungiye he ? ||| Where did he flee ?
Aba hakurya ahantu ... ahahoze muri commune Kanombe . Ariko ubu imbona nkubone ku buryo isaha namushakira namubona , kuko niba ubuyobozi bumukeneye nagenda nkamuzana , nkaba namwerekana adresse ze ndazizi . ||| He lives up there ... in the former Kanombe commune . In case he is needed by the authorities I can get him face to face . I know his adresses .
Ni ukuvuga ko witeguye kuba wa ... kuzatanga ubuhamya , ku bantu bose bashobora kuba ... kuko jyewe impamvu nakubajije abantu b' abayobozi ndetse nkubazamo n' abantu bize , n' abantu waba wavuga uti bagiraga n' uruhare mu gukangurira abantu génocide , abo bantu ushobora kuba wababona nabo babateraga inkunga kandi bari hanze ahangaha bakidegembya . ||| Does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why I asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide . Can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy .
Abashobora kuboneka nk' ubu Leta ifite umugambi wo gushakisha abo bose bakoze itsembabwoko bakiri hanze y' igihugu . Nk' ubu numvise ngo yafashwe yenda ngo yajyanywe Arusha , naho najyayo kuko ukuri kwanjye ntabwo kugarukiye ahangaha . Abandi bo bari hafi yanjye , nk' uwo muyobozi Bizimungu Isaac ari i Ririma ni ukuvuga ngo aramutse ashatse guhakana , ubutabera bukankenera naho nakwihutira kujyayo . Mweraka iki?Mubwira nti ibuka wa munsi cya gihe turi aha n' aha ufite imbunda utubwira ngo tujye imbere dutsembe umututsi nta kindi amaze n' ukumwica . Ibyo bikamwumvisha y' uko , nubwo akwepakwepa ariko hari abo bafatanyije icyaha . Ubu rero nditeguye , ahubwo ku bwanjye numva ahubwo leta iri kuntindira . Bibaye ngombwa ni isaha ku isaha ubuhamya bwanjye bwagera no kuri abo ngabo nyine ndamutse mbabonye nkabumvisha . Wenda ahari nabo bahindukira nabo bakavuga ukuri . ||| It would be possible to find them , since the government is putting in a lot of efort in getting those people who participated in the genocide hidding out of the country . For example if I had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to Arusha it is better . if it means to go and witness in Arusha I can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond Rwanda . Lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called Issac . He lives in Ririma . If he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , I can hurry to go there and convict him . I would remind him whatever he did while I was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period . I feel that even the government is delaying me because I am very ready to say the truth on what happened and I feel that I should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too .
Wenda wowe ntabwo wigeze wigishwa cyane cyangwa ngo ushyirwaho imbaraga kugirango wemere icyaha cyawe , wabikoze ku bushake bwawe .

Ariko nagirango nkubaze wumva igihano wahawe ari nacyo cyanahabwa n' undi wakoze icyaha nk' icyawe ariko we akaba atarigeze yemera icyaha akaba yaragiye anabihakana ? ||| May be you were not first taught or forced in order to admit what you did . You did it willingly . And by doing that , your punishment was reduced . Do you think that the punishment you were given should be given to the other person who might have done the same crime but denies what he did ?
Mu byukuri igihano nahawe , nkurikije icyaha nakoze ubundi ntibikwiranye . Ubundi icyaha cyo kwica umuntu wagombye kwicwa nawe . Ariko kubera ko gahunda ya Leta yari iriho yavugaga ngo hariho itegeko rivuga ngo @: « uzagaragaza ukuri wese azababarirwa , » niwe muhango nakurikije wa Leta iriho y' iki gihe . Kuba rero barampaye igihano cy' imyaka irindwi ( 7 ) nk' umuntu wagaragaje ukuri , wasabye imbabazi nkazihabwa biranshimishije . Ariko nk' umuntu ukibitse ku mutima gusa , uzi ibintu yakoze kugeza kuri uyu munsi akaba yicaye mu nzu ... burya rero amaraso y' umuntu ni mabi . Akaba yicaye mu nzu azi neza icyaha yakoze , yarishe umuntu . Akaba azi yuko nkanjye twafatanyije nafunguwe naje , kandi byanze bikunze nzamuvuga ndiho ntapfuye , urumva nk' uwo muntu igihe cyose ubutabera buzamushyikira , ntabwo dukwiye guhanwa kimwe .

Because when you kill someone you are also suppose to be killed . But that is not what happened , because the current government used a new rule , which says that whoever reveals the truth , his punishment will be reduced . And that is what I chose to do . Therefore , the fact that I was sentenced to a seven years imprisonment yet I killed somebody , but simply because I revealed the truth and asked for forgiveness , pleases me a lot . And I must say that I am pleased . But such people who still denies and hides the truth , they should not be given the same punishment . Because they are hiding the truth and that adds weight on what they did . To me , I believe such people should be punished by the authorities accordingly , following the rules that guide them .
Mu kwanzura nagirango ugire icyo ubwira abanyarwanda , cyangwa undi muntu wese utekereza ushobora kuzareba ubu buhamya ndetse harimo n' abongabo bakoze génocide , ndetse wanabishobora ukagira icyo ubwira abacitse ku icumu . ||| In conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to Rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors .
Icyo nabwira abanyarwanda muri rusange n' uko koko itsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba ryabaye muri iki gihugu cyacu . Ryahitanye abanyarwanda benshi , basaga miliyoni ( 1000000 ) nk' uko imibare ibigaragaza haruguru .

Nkaba nabasabaga rero abanyarwanda , cyane cyane abagitsimbaraye ku mutima wo kutagaragaza ukuri , ko bagombye kuvugisha ukuri ku byabaye , kuko nta yindi nkunga dukeneye ku munyarwanda wari muri iki gihugu , uretse kugaragaza ukuri ku byabaye . Abanyarwanda barishwe izuba riva , ni ngombwa ko tukagaragaza na none izuba riva uko byagiye bigenda . Abantu bagitsimbaraye rero nibave ku izima , bumve yuko ukuri gukenewe , kandi ko byanze bikunze umusanzu we ari ukugaragaza ukuri .

Murakoze . ||| What I can tell Rwandans in general , is that "@ it is true there was genocide in our country . @" And so many people died ; more than one million people died as it is shown in the statistics . And all those people were killed by their fellow Rwandans . Which was done in broad daylight . I believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the Rwandans . Therefore I believe that Rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ Rwandans ] . So , I am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it . Because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . People were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open . Therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth . To the genocide survivors I would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible . Which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history . In the past , Rwandans used to be kind . Therefore , I am kindly asking Rwandans to be strong and forgive us . And what we promise to reveal the truth , because that is the only thing we can offer . That is our only contribution ; "@ showing the truth . @" So that , the truth is written in the world 's history . We will tell them how their people were killed , and then ask for forgiveness from the bottom of our hearts . Thank you !!!
