Dia nivory teo amiko izay rehetra nangovitra noho ny tenin' Andriamanitry ny Isiraely ny amin' ny fahadisoan' ny olona izay efa niverina avy tamin' ny fahababoana ; ary izaho mbola nipetraka tahaka ilay torana iny ihany hatramin' ny fotoan' ny fanatitra hariva . ||| Everyone who held the words of the God of Israel in awe gathered around me because of the unfaithful acts of the people of the exile .

Ary nisy sasany tamin' ny Manase niala hanatona an' i Davida , raha nomba ny Filistina hiady amin' i Saoly izy , nefa tsy nanampy azy izy ; fa ireo andrianan' ny Filistina nifampisaina , dia nampandeha azy ka nanao hoe @: Ny lohantsika no ho entiny mila sitraka hiverenany amin' i Saoly tompony . ||| Some men from Manasseh joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul .

If I go tell Ahab I 've seen you , he will n't be able to find you and he will kill me . That would not be fair , because your servant has been a loyal follower of the Lord from my youth .
Hilelaka ny vovoka toy ny menarana izy ; Hiala amin @-@ kovitra avy ao amin' ny fiarovany mafy tahaka ny biby mikisaka amin' ny tany izy ; Jehovah Andriamanitsika dia hohatoniny amin @-@ kovitra , Eny , hatahotra Anao izy . ||| They will lick the dust like a snake , like serpents crawling on the ground .

Izay rehetra mankahala ny rahalahiny dia mpamono olona ; ary fantatrareo fa tsy mba misy mpamono olona manana fiainana mandrakizay mitoetra ao anatiny . ||| Do not love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him ,
Ary hoy Jehovah tamiko tamin' ny andro nanjakan' i Josia mpanjaka @: Moa efa hitanao va izay nataon' Isiraely mpiodina ? Niakatra ho eny amin' ny tendrombohitra avo rehetra sy ho eny ambanin' ny hazo maitso rehetra izy ka nijangajanga teny . ||| When Josiah was king of Judah , the Lord said to me , "@ Jeremiah , you have no doubt seen what wayward Israel has done . You have seen how she went up to every high hill and under every green tree to give herself like a prostitute to other gods .
Nefa ny famindram @-@ poko tsy hofoanako aminy , Ary ny fahamarinako tsy havadiko , ||| But I will not remove my loyal love from him , nor be unfaithful to my promise .
Maro noho ny volon @-@ dohako ny isan' izay mankahala ahy tsy ahoan @-@ tsy ahoana ; mahery izay ta @-@ hahafaty ahy , dia ny fahavaloko tsy ahoan @-@ tsy ahoana ; mampanonitra ahy izay tsy nalaiko izy . ||| Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head . Those who want to destroy me , my enemies for no reason , outnumber me . They make me repay what I did not steal !
Ary tamin' izany andro izany indrindra no nitondran' i Jehovah ny Zanak' Isiraely nivoaka avy tany amin' ny tany Egypta araka ny antokony . ||| And on this very day the Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their regiments .
Dia nifoha maraina koa Abrahama ka nankany amin' ilay efa nijanonany teo anatrehan' i Jehovah ; ||| Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the Lord .
Ny mpandranto avy any Sheba sy Rama no mpandranto nankany aminao , Ka zava @-@ manitra tsara indrindra sy vato soa samy hafa karazana ary volamena no nentiny natakalo ny entanao . ||| The merchants of Sheba and Raamah engaged in trade with you ; they traded the best kinds of spices along with precious stones and gold for your products .

fa hatrany alohan' ny lalàna aza dia nisy ota tamin' izao tontolo izao ; nefa tsy isaina ny ota , raha tsy misy lalàna ; ||| for before the law was given , sin was in the world , but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law .
Ary nony tonga ny olona tamin' ny niverenan' i Davida avy namono ilay Filistina , dia nivoaka ny vehivavy avy tamin' ny tanànan' ny Isiraely rehetra ka nihira sy nandihy nitsena an' i Saoly mpanjaka tamin' ny ampongatapaka sy ny fifaliana ary ny kipantsona* . ||| When the men arrived after David returned from striking down the Philistine , the women from all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing to meet King Saul .

Ary Mesa , mpanjakan' i Moaba , nanana ondry betsaka ; ary nandoa hetra ho an' ny mpanjakan' ny Isiraely izy , dia zanak' ondry iray hetsy sy ny volon' ondrilahy iray hetsy* . ||| Now King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder . He would send as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 male lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams .
koa tandremo mba harahinareo ny didy rehetra sy ny fitsipika izay ataoko eo anoloanareo anio . ||| Be certain to keep all the statutes and ordinances that I am presenting to you today .
Dia tonga tamiko indray ny tenin' i Jehovah nanao hoe @: ||| Moreover , the word of the Lord came to me as follows @:
Fa izay tsy nahalala kosa ka nanao izay zavatra tokony hikapohana azy dia hokapohina kely . Fa izay nomena be , dia be no hotadiavina aminy ; ary izay nampitehirizina be , dia bebe kokoa no hadinina aminy . ||| But the one who did not know his master 's will and did things worthy of punishment will receive a light beating . From everyone who has been given much , much will be required , and from the one who has been entrusted with much , even more will be asked . Not Peace , but Division
Ary na dia ianao aza dia ampialainy amin' ny fahaterena ho amin' ny malalaka izay tsy misy mahatery ; Ary ny matavy indrindra no aroso ho eo ambonin' ny latabatrao . ||| And surely , he drew you from the mouth of distress , to a wide place , unrestricted , and to the comfort of your table filled with rich food .
Fa ho Jesosy taminy @: Tsy misy mpaminany tsy hajaina afa @-@ tsy eo amin' ny taniny sy ny havany ary ny ankohonany ihany . ||| Then Jesus said to them , "@ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown , and among his relatives , and in his own house . @"
Ary hoy koa Izy tamin @-@ dravehivavy @: Hahabe dia hahabe ny fahorianao Aho , indrindra fa raha manan' anaka ianao ; ary fahoriana no hiterahanao zanaka ; ary ny vadinao no hianteheran' ny fanirianao , ka izy no hanapaka anao . ||| To the woman he said , "@ I will greatly increase your labor pains ; with pain you will give birth to children . You will want to control your husband , but he will dominate you . @"
Ny rahalahiko mampihambo manana ahy tahaka ny ranotrambo , dia tahaka ny mason @-@ drano any an @-@ dohasahan @-@ driaka , izay malaky ritra , ||| My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream , and as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams that flow away .
Ary ho tonga ao izy ka hanaisotra ny zava @-@ dratsiny rehetra sy ny fahavetavetany rehetra . ||| "@ When they return to it , they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations .
Ary nisy roan @-@ jato lahy izay nasain' i Absaloma , ka dia nanaraka azy avy tany Jerosalema , nefa nandeha tamin' ny fahatsoran' ny fony izy ireo , fa tsy nahafantatra na inona na inona . ||| Now two hundred men had gone with Absalom from Jerusalem . Since they were invited , they went naively and were unaware of what Absalom was planning .
Mitsangàna , ka mialà , Satria misy fahalotoana mahatonga fandringanana eto , eny , fandringanana mafy . ||| But you are the ones who will be forced to leave ! For this land is not secure ! Sin will thoroughly destroy it !
Mandehana , hano amin' ny fifaliana ny haninao , ary sotroy amin' ny fo falifaly ny divainao , fa efa nankasitrahan' Andriamanitra ela ny asanao . ||| Go , eat your food with joy , and drink your wine with a happy heart , because God has already approved your works .
Ary Jese naka mofo tokony ho zakan' ny boriky iray sy divay iray siny hoditra sy zanak' osy , ka nampitondrainy an' i Davida zanany ho an' i Saoly ireo . ||| So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread , a container of wine , and a young goat and sent them to Saul with his son David .
IZAO no didy sy fitsipika izay hotandremanareo harahina any amin' ny tany izay omen' i Jehovah , Andriamanitry ny razanao , anao holovana amin' ny andro rehetra hiainanareo ambonin' ny tany . ||| These are the statutes and ordinances you must be careful to obey as long as you live in the land the Lord , the God of your ancestors , has given you to possess .
Ary ny tanan' ny Apostoly no nanaovana famantarana sy fahagagana maro teo amin' ny vahoaka ; ary izy rehetra niray saina teo amin' ny Fialofan' i Solomona ; ||| Now many miraculous signs and wonders came about among the people through the hands of the apostles . By common consent they were all meeting together in Solomon 's Portico .
Izao rehetra izao dia efa hitako tamin' ny androko mandalo foana @: misy marina maty amin' ny hamarinany ; ary misy meloka ela velona amin' ny haratsiany . ||| During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things @: Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness , and sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds .
ary ny sarin' izay rehetra efa niseho tamin' ny fanahiny ; dia ny amin' ny kianjan' ny tranon' i Jehovah sy ny efi @-@ trano rehetra manodidina azy ho an' ny rakitry ny tranon' i Jehovah sy ny zavatra nohamasinina ho rakitra , ||| He gave him the blueprints of all he envisioned for the courts of the Lord 's temple , all the surrounding rooms , the storehouses of God 's temple , and the storehouses for the holy items .
Izay olona anarina matetika ka mihamafy hatoka Dia ho torotoro tampoka , ka tsy hisy fahasitranana . ||| The one who stiffens his neck after numerous rebukes will suddenly be destroyed without remedy .
Namely ny voalobony sy ny aviaviny Izy Ka nanapatapaka ny hazo teo amin' ny taniny . ||| He destroyed their vines and fig trees , and broke the trees throughout their territory .
Amin' izany andro izany dia hisy lalambe avy any Egypta mankany Asyria , koa ny Asyriana dia hankany Egypta , ary ny Egyptiana kosa hankany Asyria , ary ny Egyptiana sy ny Asyriana hiara-mivavaka* . ||| At that time there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria . The Assyrians will visit Egypt , and the Egyptians will visit Assyria . The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together .

Ary tamin' ny andro fahavalo dia Gamaliela , zanak' i Pedazora , lohan' ny taranak' i Manase , no nanatitra . ||| On the eighth day Gamaliel son of Pedahzur , leader of the Manassehites , presented an offering .

Jehovah no heriko sy ampingako ; izy no nitokian' ny foko , ka voavonjy aho ; dia mifaly ny foko , ka ny hirako no hiderako Azy . ||| The Lord strengthens and protects me ; I trust in him with all my heart . I am rescued and my heart is full of joy ; I will sing to him in gratitude .
Dia nitaraina tamin' i Jehovah ireo , raha ory , Ka novonjeny tamin' ny fahatereny . ||| They cried out to the Lord in their distress ; he delivered them from their troubles .
Ary nankany Kapernaomy izy ireo ; nony tamin' ny Sabata , dia niditra tao amin' ny synagoga niaraka tamin' izay Jesosy ka nampianatra . ||| Then they went to Capernaum . When the Sabbath came , Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach .
Indro , manampina ny rano Izy , ka dia ritra iny ; Ary alefany indray ka mahasimba ny tany . ||| If he holds back the waters , then they dry up ; if he releases them , they destroy the land .
Ary raha nilatsaka tamin' ny toby ny ando nony alina , dia nilatsaka koa niaraka taminy ny mana . ||| And when the dew came down on the camp in the night , the manna fell with it . ) Moses ' Complaint to the Lord
Ary nisy Fariseo nanatona Azy @* , dia naka fanahy Azy hoe @: Mahazo misaotra ny vadiny va ny lehilahy noho izay rehetra entiny iampangany azy na inona na inona ? ||| Then some Pharisees came to him in order to test him . They asked , "@ Is it lawful to divorce a wife for any cause ? @"
Ary hoy Jehovah tamin' i Mosesy @: Soraty eo amin' ny boky izany ho fahatsiarovana , ka ambarao amin' i Josoa ; fa hofoanako tokoa ny fahatsiarovana ny Amalekita tsy ho eny ambanin' ny lanitra . ||| The Lord said to Moses , "@ Write this as a memorial in the book , and rehearse it in Joshua 's hearing ; for I will surely wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven .
Ary ny Levita koa dia hahazo ny mifanolotra amin' ny fari @-@ tanin' ny mpisorona , dia dimy arivo amby roa alina ny lavany , ary iray alina ny sakany , eny , samy dimy arivo amby roa alina ny lavany , sy iray alina ny sakany . ||| "@ Alongside the border of the priests , the Levites will have an allotment eight and a quarter miles in length and three and one @-@ third miles in width . The whole length will be eight and a quarter miles and the width three and one @-@ third miles .
Fa Andriamanitra tsy mba tsy marina hanadino ny asanareo sy ny fitiavana izay nasehonareo ho voninahitry ny anarany , raha nanompo ny olona masina ianareo sady mbola manompo ihany . ||| For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have demonstrated for his name , in having served and continuing to serve the saints .
Dia hoy Jesosy @: Tahaka ny inona ny fanjakan' Andriamanitra ? ary inona no hanoharako azy ? ||| Thus Jesus asked , "@ What is the kingdom of God like ? To what should I compare it ?
Ary talohan' ny andro firavoravoana tamin' ny Paska , satria fantatr' i Jesosy fa tonga ny fotoana hialany amin' izao tontolo izao ho any amin' ny Ray , ary efa tia ny Azy izay amin' izao tontolo izao Izy , dia tia azy hatramin' ny farany . ||| Just before the Passover feast , Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father .

Ataonao ho fifandirana amin' ny mifanila fonenana aminay izahay ; ary ny fahavalonay mifaly handatsa . ||| You have made our neighbors dislike us , and our enemies insult us .

Izay rehetra nahita azy dia nandringana azy , ary ny fahavalony nanao hoe @: Tsy manan @-@ keloka izahay , satria izy efa nanota tamin' i Jehovah , fonenan' ny fahamarinana , dia Jedovah , fanantenan' ny razany . ||| All who encountered them devoured them .

They have sinned against the Lord in whom their ancestors trusted . ’
Izaho tsy nipetraka na nifaly teo amin' ny fivorian' ny mpikorana , nitoetra irery aho noho ny fihazonan' ny tananao ahy , fa nofenoinao fahatezerana aho . ||| I did not spend my time in the company of other people , laughing and having a good time .

Ary ny tany hilaozan' ny olona ka hanonitra ny sabatany , raha mitoetra foana tsy misy olona izy ; ary ny olona hanonitra ny amin' ny helony , satria nandà ny fitsipiko Izy , ary halan' ny fanahiny ny didiko . ||| The land will be abandoned by them in order that it may make up for its Sabbaths while it is made desolate without them , and they will make up for their iniquity because they have rejected my regulations and have abhorred my statutes .
Dia nitsangana izy ka nambeta ny fandriany niaraka tamin' izay ary niala teo anatrehan' ny olona rehetra ; dia talanjona izy rehetra ka nankalaza an' Andriamanitra nanao hoe @: Tsy mbola nahita izay toy izao izahay . ||| And immediately the man stood up , took his stretcher , and went out in front of them all .

Then Joseph brought them closer to his father .
Ary nikasa @* handringana azy Izy , Raha tsy Mosesy voafidiny no nandroso hijoro tamin' ny banga teo anatrehany hampiala ny fahatezerany mba tsy handringanany azy . ||| He threatened to destroy them , but Moses , his chosen one , interceded with him and turned back his destructive anger .
Masìna ianao , aoka ny tompoko tsy hisaina io Nabala lehilahy tena ratsy fanahy io , fa araka ny anarany ihany no toeny ; Nabala @* no anarany , ary hadalana no ao aminy ; fa izaho ankizivavinao , tompoko , tsy mba nahita ny zatovo nirahinao . ||| My lord should not pay attention to this wicked man Nabal .

Kanefa masina Hianao , Ry mipetraka eo ambonin' ny fideran' ny Isiraely . ||| You are holy ; you sit as king receiving the praises of Israel .

Fa voaozona ny mpamitaka , izay manana ondrilahy ao amin' ny ondriny , ary mivoady , nefa mamono zavatra misy kilema hatao fanatitra ho an' ny Tompo . Fa Mpanjaka lehibe Aho , hoy Jehovah , Tompon' ny maro , ary ny anarako dia mahatahotra any amin' ny jentilisa . ||| "@ There will be harsh condemnation for the hypocrite who has a valuable male animal in his flock but vows and sacrifices something inferior to the Lord .

Fifaliana amin' ny olona ny manisy soa ; Ary aleo ho malahelo toy izay ho mpandainga . ||| What is desirable for a person is to show loyal love , and a poor person is better than a liar .
Any amin' ny voatrabaky ny sabatra no hiampatramparany ; Ny sabatra dia efa voatolotra ; Tariho izy mbamin' ny vahoakany maro be rehetra . ||| They will fall among those killed by the sword . The sword is drawn ; they carry her and all her hordes away .
