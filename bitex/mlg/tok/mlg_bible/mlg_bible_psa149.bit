Haleloia . Mihirà fihiram @-@ baovao ho an' i Jehovah , Ny fiderana Azy eo amin' ny fiangonan' ny olona masina . ||| Praise the Lord ! Sing to the Lord a new song ! Praise him in the assembly of the godly !
Aoka ny Isiraely hifaly amin' ny Mpanao azy ; Aoka ho finaritra amin' ny Mpanjakany ny zanak' i Ziona . ||| Let Israel rejoice in their Creator ! Let the people of Zion delight in their king !
Aoka hidera ny anarany amin' ny dihy izy Sy hankalaza Azy amin' ny ampongatapaka sy ny lokanga . ||| Let them praise his name with dancing ! Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp !
Fa sitrak' i Jehovah ny olony ; Ravahany famonjena ny mpandefitra . ||| For the Lord takes delight in his people ; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them .
Aoka ny olona masina hifaly amin' ny voninahitra ; Aoka hihoby tsara eo am @-@ pandriany izy . ||| Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication ! Let them shout for joy upon their beds !
Aoka hisy fanandratana an' Andriamanitra eo am @-@ bavany Sy sabatra roa lela eny an @-@ tànany , ||| May they praise God while they hold a two @-@ edged sword in their hand ,
Hamaliany ny Jentilisa Sy hamaizany ny firenena maro , ||| in order to take revenge on the nations , and punish foreigners .
Hamatorany ireo mpanjakany amin' ny gadra , Sy ny olo @-@ malazany amin' ny gadra vy . ||| They bind their kings in chains , and their nobles in iron shackles ,
Mba hanaovany ny fitsarana voasoratra @: Voninahitry ny olony masina rehetra Izany . Haleloia . ||| and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced . All his loyal followers will be vindicated . Praise the Lord !
