 ||| In the Lord I have taken shelter . How can you say to me , "@ Flee to a mountain like a bird !
Fa , indro , ny ratsy fanahy manenjana ny tsipìkany ; efa nanamboatra ny zana @-@ tsipìkany eo amin' ny kofehy izy , nikendry tao amin' ny maizina hitifitra ny mahitsy fo . ||| For look , the wicked prepare their bows , they put their arrows on the strings , to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright .
Fa rava ny fanorenana @* , ka inona indray no azon' ny marina atao ? ||| When the foundations are destroyed , what can the godly accomplish ? @"
Jehovah dia ao amin' ny tempoliny masina , ny seza fiandrianan' i Jehovah dia any an @-@ danitra ; ny masony mijery , eny , ny hodi @-@ masony mizaha toetra ny zanak' olombelona . ||| The Lord is in his holy temple ; the Lord 's throne is in heaven . His eyes watch ; his eyes examine all people .
Jehovah mizaha toetra ny marina ; fa ny ratsy fanahy sy ny mifaly hampidi @-@ doza dia samy halan' ny fanahiny . ||| The Lord approves of the godly , but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence .
Handatsaka fandrika amin' ny ratsy fanahy Izy tahaka ny fandatsaka ranonorana ; afo sy solifara ary rivo @-@ mahamay no ho anjara kapoakany . ||| May the Lord rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked ! A whirlwind is what they deserve !
Fa marina Jehovah , ka fahamarinana no tiany ; ny mahitsy no hahita ny tavany*. ||| Certainly the Lord is just ; he rewards godly deeds ; the upright will experience his favor .
