Ho an' ny mpiventy hira . Al @-@ mahalath . Maskila nataon' i Davida . Ny adala manao anakampo hoe @: tsy misy Andriamanitra . Manao izay ratsy sy vetaveta izy , tsy misy manao ny tsara . ||| Fools say to themselves , "@ There is no God . @" They sin and commit evil deeds ; none of them does what is right .
Eny an @-@ danitra Andriamanitra miondrika mijery ny zanak' olombelona , mba hizaha na misy hendry mitady an' Andriamanitra . ||| God looks down from heaven at the human race , to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God .
Samy efa nivily izy rehetra ka tonga vetaveta avokoa ; tsy misy manao ny tsara , na dia iray akory aza . ||| Everyone rejects God ; they are all morally corrupt . None of them does what is right , not even one !
Tsy mahalala va ny mpanao ratsy , izay mihinana ny oloko toy ny fihinan @-@ kanina , ary Andriamanitra tsy antsoiny ? ||| All those who behave wickedly do not understand - those who devour my people as if they were eating bread , and do not call out to God .
Indreo , matahotra dia matahotra ireny , nefa tsy nisy tokony hatahorany ; fa Andriamanitra efa nanely ny taolan' izay nitoby hamely anao ; nampahamenatra azy ianao , satria efa narian' Andriamanitra izy . ||| They are absolutely terrified , even by things that do not normally cause fear . For God annihilates those who attack you . You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them .
Enga anie ka hivoaka avy ao Ziona ny famonjena ny Isiraely ! raha ampodin' Andriamanitra avy amin' ny fahababoana ny olony , dia ho faly Jakoba , ary ho ravoravo Isiraely . ||| I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion ! When God restores the well @-@ being of his people , may Jacob rejoice , may Israel be happy !
