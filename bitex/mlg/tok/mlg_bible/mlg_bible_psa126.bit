 ||| When the Lord restored the well @-@ being of Zion , we thought we were dreaming .
Fahizay dia feno hehy ny vavantsika Sy fihobiana ny lelantsika ; Dia natao tany amin' ny Jentilisa hoe @: Zava @-@ dehibe no nataon' i Jehovah ho an' ireny . ||| At that time we laughed loudly and shouted for joy . At that time the nations said , "@ The Lord has accomplished great things for these people . @"
Eny , zava @-@ dehibe no nataon' i Jehovah ho antsika , Ka dia faly isika . ||| The Lord did indeed accomplish great things for us . We were happy .
Tanteraho , Jehovah Ã´ , ny ham @-@ podiana anay avy amin' ny fahababoana , Tahaka ny fiverenan' ny riaka any amin' ny tany atsimo . ||| O Lord , restore our well @-@ being , just as the streams in the arid south are replenished .
Izay mamafy am @-@ pitomaniana Dia hijinja am @-@ pifaliana . ||| Those who shed tears as they plant will shout for joy when they reap the harvest .
Mandeha mitomany mitondra ny voa afafiny izy , Fa hiverina mitondra ny amboarany amin' ny fihobiana kosa . ||| The one who weeps as he walks along , carrying his bag of seed , will certainly come in with a shout of joy , carrying his sheaves of grain .
