Amin' izany andro izany dia hisy loharano voasokatra ho an' ny taranak' i Davida sy ho an' ny mponina any Jerosalema hanafaka fahotana sy fahalotoana . ||| "@ In that day there will be a fountain opened up for the dynasty of David and the people of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and impurity .
Ary amin' izany andro izany , hoy Jehovah , Tompon' ny maro , dia hofoanako ny anaran @-@ tsampy amin' ny tany , ka tsy hotsarovana intsony ireny ; ary hesoriko amin' ny tany ny mpaminany sy ny fanahim @-@ pahalotoana . ||| And also on that day , " says the Lord who rules over all , "@ I will remove the names of the idols from the land and they will never again be remembered . Moreover , I will remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land .
Ary raha mbola hisy haminany , ny ray aman @-@ dreniny izay niteraka azy dia hanao aminy hoe @: Tsy ho velona ianao , satria miteny lainga amin' ny anaran' i Jehovah ; ary ny ray aman @-@ dreniny izay niteraka azy dia handefona azy , raha maminany izy . ||| Then , if anyone prophesies in spite of this , his father and mother to whom he was born will say to him , ‘ You can not live , for you lie in the name of the Lord . ’ Then his father and mother to whom he was born will run him through with a sword when he prophesies .
Ary amin' izany andro izany ny mpaminany dia samy hahazo henatra noho ny fahitany avy , raha maminany ; ary tsy hikapôty volom @-@ biby hamitahana izy , ||| "@ Therefore , on that day each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and will no longer wear the hairy garment of a prophet to deceive the people .
fa hanao hoe @: Tsy mpaminany aho , fa mpiasa tany , satria nisy nanandevo @* ahy , fony aho mbola kely . ||| Instead he will say , ‘ I am no prophet - indeed , I am a farmer , for a man has made me his indentured servant since my youth . ’
Dia hisy hanao aminy hoe @: Ka inona itony ratra amin*'ny tananao itony ? Dia hovaliany hoe @: Naratra tao an @-@ tranon' ny sakaizako ireny . ||| Then someone will ask him , ‘ What are these wounds on your chest ? ’ and he will answer , ‘ Some that I received in the house of my friends . ’
Mifohaza , ry sabatra , hamely ny mpiandriko sy ny lehilahy namako , hoy Jehovah , Tompon' ny maro . Asio ny mpiandry , dia hihahaka ny ondry , ary hamerina ny tanako ho amin' ny madinika Aho . ||| "@ Awake , sword , against my shepherd , against the man who is my associate , " says the Lord who rules over all . Strike the shepherd that the flock may be scattered ; I will turn my hand against the insignificant ones .
Ary amin' ny tany rehetra , hoy Jehovah , ny androatokony dia haringana ho faty ao ; fa ny ampahatelony sisa no havela ao kosa . ||| It will happen in all the land , says the Lord , that two @-@ thirds of the people in it will be cut off and die , but one @-@ third will be left in it .
Ary ho entiko miditra amin' ny afo ny ampahatelony , ary harendrika toy ny fandrendrika volafotsy izy , ary hizahako toetra toy ny fizaha toetra ny volamena izy ; hiantso ny anarako izy , ary Izaho hamaly azy ; Izaho hanao hoe @: Oloko izy ary izy hanao hoe @: Jehovah no Andriamanitro . ||| Then I will bring the remaining third into the fire ; I will refine them like silver is refined and will test them like gold is tested . They will call on my name and I will answer ; I will say , ‘ These are my people , ’ and they will say , ‘ The Lord is my God . ’ @"
