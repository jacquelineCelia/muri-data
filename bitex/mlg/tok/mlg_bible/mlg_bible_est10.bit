Ary Ahasoerosy mpanjaka nampandoa hetra ny tany sy ny nosin @-@ dranomasina . ||| King Ahasuerus then imposed forced labor on the land and on the coastlands of the sea .
Ary izay rehetra nataony araka ny fahefany sy ny heriny mbamin' ny filazana ny fahalehibiazan' i Mordekay , araka izay nanandratan' ny mpanjaka azy , tsy efa voasoratra ao amin' ny bokin' ny tantaran' ny mpanjakan' i Media sy Persia va izany ? ||| Now all the actions carried out under his authority and his great achievements , along with an exact statement concerning the greatness of Mordecai , whom the king promoted , are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia ?
Fa Mordekay Jiosy no nanarakaraka an' i Ahasoerosy mpanjaka sady nalaza tamin' ny Jiosy ka nankasitrahan' ny rahalahiny maro , satria nitady hihasoa ny fireneny izy sady nilaza fiadanana tamin' ny olona rehetra iray firazanana aminy . ||| Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus . He was the highest @-@ ranking Jew , and he was admired by his numerous relatives . He worked enthusiastically for the good of his people and was an advocate for the welfare of all his descendants .
