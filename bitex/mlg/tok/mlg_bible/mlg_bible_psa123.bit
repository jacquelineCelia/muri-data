 ||| I look up toward you , the one enthroned in heaven .
Indro , toy ny fijerin' ny ankizilahy Ny tanan' ny tompolahiny , Ary toy ny fijerin' ny ankizivavy Ny tanan' ny tompovaviny , No fijerintsika an' i Jehovah Andriamanitsika , Mandra @-@ pamindra fony amintsika . ||| Look , as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master , as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress , so my eyes will look to the Lord , our God , until he shows us favor .
Mamindrà fo aminay , Jehovah ô , mamindrà fo aminay ; Fa tototry ny fanamavoana loatra izahay ; ||| Show us favor , O Lord , show us favor ! For we have had our fill of humiliation , and then some .
Eny , tototry ny famingavingan' ny miadana ny fanahinay , Sy tototry ny fanamavoan' ny mpiavonavona . ||| We have had our fill of the taunts of the self @-@ assured , of the contempt of the proud .
