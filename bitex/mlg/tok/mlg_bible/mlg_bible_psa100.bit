Salamo ho fiderana . Mihobia ho an' i Jehovah , ry tany rehetra . ||| Shout out praises to the Lord , all the earth !
Manompoa an' i Jehovah amin' ny fifaliana ; Mankanesa eo anatrehany amin' ny fihobiana . ||| Worship the Lord with joy ! Enter his presence with joyful singing !
Aoka ho fantatrareo fa Jehovah no Andriamanitra ; Izy no nanao antsika , ary Azy isika @* , Dia olony sy ondry fiandriny . ||| Acknowledge that the Lord is God ! He made us and we belong to him ; we are his people , the sheep of his pasture .
Midira eo amin' ny vavahadiny amin' ny fisaorana , Ary eo an @-@ kianjany amin' ny fiderana ; Misaora Azy , mankalaz√† ny anarany , ||| Enter his gates with thanksgiving , and his courts with praise ! Give him thanks ! Praise his name !
Fa tsara Jehovah ; Mandrakizay ny famindram @-@ pony , Ary mihatra amin' ny taranaka fara mandimby ny fahamarinany . ||| For the Lord is good . His loyal love endures , and he is faithful through all generations .
