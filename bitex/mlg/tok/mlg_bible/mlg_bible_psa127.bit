 ||| If the Lord does not build a house , then those who build it work in vain . If the Lord does not guard a city , then the watchman stands guard in vain .
Zava @-@ poana ho anareo ny mifoha maraina Sy ny alim @-@ pandry Ka homana ny hanina azo amin' ny fahasahiranana ; Izany anefa dia omeny ihany ho an' ny malalany , na dia matory aza izy . ||| It is vain for you to rise early , come home late , and work so hard for your food . Yes , he can provide for those whom he loves even when they sleep .
Indro , lova avy amin' i Jehovah ny zanaka maro ; Tamby ny ateraky ny kibo . ||| Yes , sons are a gift from the Lord , the fruit of the womb is a reward .
Tahaka ny zana @-@ tsipìka eo an @-@ tànan' ny mahery Ny zanaky ny fahatanorana . ||| Sons born during one 's youth are like arrows in a warrior 's hand .
Sambatra izay mameno ny tranon @-@ jana @-@ tsipìkany amin' ireny ; Tsy ho menatra ireny , raha mifamaly amin' ny fahavalo eo am @-@ bavahady . ||| How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them ! They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate .
