 ||| The Lord said to me , "@ Go , show love to your wife again , even though she loves another man and continually commits adultery . Likewise , the Lord loves the Israelites although they turn to other gods and love to offer raisin cakes to idols . @"
Ka dia novidiko sekely volafotsy dimy ambin' ny folo sy vary hordea homera iray sy tapany izy . ||| So I paid fifteen shekels of silver and about seven bushels of barley to purchase her .
Ary hoy izaho taminy @: Andro maro no hitoeranao miandry ahy ; fa tsy havela hijangajanga na hanambady olon @-@ kafa ianao ; ary izaho koa dia ho toy izany aminao . ||| Then I told her , "@ You must live with me many days ; you must not commit adultery or have sexual intercourse with another man , and I also will wait for you . @"
Fa andro maro no hitoeran' ny Zanak' Isiraely tsy hanana mpanjaka , na mpanapaka , na fanatitra , na tsangam @-@ bato , na efoda , na terafima . ||| For the Israelites must live many days without a king or prince , without sacrifice or sacred fertility pillar , without ephod or idols .
Rehefa afaka izany , dia hiverina ny Zanak' Isiraely ka hitady an' i Jehovah Andriamaniny sy Davida mpanjakany ; ary nandeha amin @-@ kovitra hanatona an' i Jehovah sy ny fahasoavany izy , raha mby any amparany . ||| Afterward , the Israelites will turn and seek the Lord their God and their Davidic king . Then they will submit to the Lord in fear and receive his blessings in the future .
