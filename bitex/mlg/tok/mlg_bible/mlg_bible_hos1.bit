Ny tenin' i Jehovah , izay tonga tamin' i Hosea , zanak' i Bery , tamin' ny andro nanjakan' i Ozia sy Jotama sy Ahaza ary Hezekia , mpanjakan' ny Joda , sy tamin' ny andron' i Jeroboama , zanak' i Joasy , mpanjakan' ny Isiraely . ||| This is the word of the Lord which was revealed to Hosea son of Beeri during the time when Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah ruled Judah , and during the time when Jeroboam son of Joash ruled Israel . Symbols of Sin and Judgment @: The Prostitute and Her Children
Tamin' ny niandohan' ny nitenenan' i Jehovah tamin' i Hosea dia hoy Jehovah taminy @: Andeha ianao maka vady izay efa tena janga sy zanaky ny fijangajangana ; fa fatra @-@ pijangajanga miala amin' i Jehovah ny tany . ||| When the Lord first spoke through Hosea , he said to him , "@ Go marry a prostitute who will bear illegitimate children conceived through prostitution , because the nation continually commits spiritual prostitution by turning away from the Lord . @"
Dia lasa izy naka an' i Gomera , zanakavavin' i Diblaima ; ary dia nanan' anaka ravehivavy ka nitera @-@ dahy taminy . ||| So Hosea married Gomer , the daughter of Diblaim . Then she conceived and gave birth to a son for him .
Ary hoy Jehovah taminy @: Ataovy Jezirela no anarany ; fa vetivety dia hovaliako ny taranak' i Jeho noho ny rà nalatsaka tao Jezirela , ary hatsahatro ny fanjakan' ny taranak' Isiraely . ||| Then the Lord said to Hosea , "@ Name him ‘ Jezreel , ’ because in a little while I will punish the dynasty of Jehu on account of the bloodshed in the valley of Jezreel , and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel .
Ary amin' izany andro izany dia hotapahiko ao amin' ny tany lemaka Jezirela ny tsipìkan' Isiraely . ||| At that time , I will destroy the military power of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . @"
Ary nanan' anaka indray ravehivavy ka nitera @-@ bavy . Dia hoy Jehovah taminy @: Ataovy Lò-rohama* no anarany ; fa tsy hamindra fo amin' ny taranak' Isiraely intsony Aho , eny , tsy havelako mihitsy ny helony**. ||| She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter . Then the Lord said to him , "@ Name her ‘ No Pity ’ ( Lo @-@ Ruhamah ) because I will no longer have pity on the nation of Israel . For I will certainly not forgive their guilt .
Fa ny taranak' i Joda no hamindrako fo , ary Izaho Jehovah Andriamaniny no hamonjy azy , nefa tsy amin' ny tsipìka , na amin' ny sabatra , na amin' ny ady , na amin' ny soavaly , na amin' ny mpitaingin @-@ tsoavaly . ||| But I will have pity on the nation of Judah . I will deliver them by the Lord their God ; I will not deliver them by the warrior 's bow , by sword , by military victory , by chariot horses , or by chariots . @"
Ary rehefa notazana Lò @-@ rohama , dia nanan' anaka indray reniny ka nitera @-@ dahy . ||| When she had weaned ‘ No Pity ’ ( Lo @-@ Ruhamah ) she conceived again and gave birth to another son .
Dia hoy Jehovah @: Ataovy Lò-amy* no anarany ; fa ianareo tsy oloko , ary Izaho tsy ho Andriamanitrareo**. ||| Then the Lord said @: "@ Name him ‘ Not My People ’ ( Lo @-@ Ammi ) , because you are not my people and I am not your God . @"
