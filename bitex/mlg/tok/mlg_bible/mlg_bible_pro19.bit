Izay miantra ny malahelo dia mampisambotra an' i Jehovah , Ary izay nomeny dia honerany kosa . ||| The one who is gracious to the poor lends to the Lord , and the Lord will repay him for his good deed .
Faizo ny zanakao , fa mbola misy azo antenaina ihany , Nefa aza dia entim @-@ po loatra , fandrao mahafaty azy . ||| Discipline your child , for there is hope , but do not set your heart on causing his death .
Ny lozabe tsy maintsy hampijalina ; Ary na dia vonjenao aza izy , dia mbola hanahirana anao ihany indray . ||| A person with great anger bears the penalty , but if you deliver him from it once , you will have to do it again .

Fifaliana amin' ny olona ny manisy soa ; Ary aleo ho malahelo toy izay ho mpandainga . ||| What is desirable for a person is to show loyal love , and a poor person is better than a liar .
Ny fahatahorana an' i Jehovah no ahazoana fiainana ; Izay manana izany tsy mba handry fotsy sady tsy hiharan @-@ doza . ||| Fearing the Lord leads to life , and one who does so will live satisfied ; he will not be afflicted by calamity .
Ny malaina dia mangarona ny eo an @-@ dovia amin' ny t√†nany , Nefa ny mampakatra azy ho amin' ny vavany dia tsy zakany . ||| The sluggard plunges his hand in the dish , and he will not even bring it back to his mouth !

Izay mitohatoha amin @-@ drainy sy mandroaka ny reniny Dia zanaka mahamenatra sy mahafa @-@ baraka . ||| The one who robs his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace .
Anaka , mitsahara tsy hihaino anatra Izay mampanalavitra anao ny tenin' ny fahalalana*. ||| If you stop listening to instruction , my child , you will stray from the words of knowledge .
Ny vavolombelona ratsy maniratsira ny fitsarana ; Ary ny vavan' ny ratsy fanahy mitelina ny ratsy . ||| A crooked witness scorns justice , and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity .
Vonona ho amin' ny mpaniratsira ny fanamelohana , Ary ny kapoka ho amin' ny lamosin' ny adala . ||| Judgments are prepared for scorners , and floggings for the backs of fools .
