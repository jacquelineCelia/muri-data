Tamin' ny taona nankanesan' i Tartana tany Asdoda , raha nirahin' i Sargona , mpanjakan' i Asyria , izy ka namely an' i Asdoda ary nahafaka azy , ||| The Lord revealed the following message during the year in which King Sargon of Assyria sent his commanding general to Ashdod , and he fought against it and captured it .
tamin' izany andro izany no nampitondran' i Jehovah teny an' Isaia , zanak' i Amoza , hoe @: Andeha , borahy ny lamba fisaonana ho afaka amin' ny valahanao , ary esory ny kiraronao hiala amin' ny tongotrao . Dia nanao izany izy ka nandeha tsy nitafy sady tsy nikiraro . ||| At that time the Lord announced through Isaiah son of Amoz @: "@ Go , remove the sackcloth from your waist and take your sandals off your feet . @" He did as instructed and walked around in undergarments and barefoot .
Ary hoy Jehovah @: Tahaka ny nandehanan' Isaia mpanompoko telo taona sady tsy nitafy no tsy nikiraro mba ho famantarana sy ho fahagagana ny amin' i Egypta sy Etiopia , ||| Later the Lord explained , "@ In the same way that my servant Isaiah has walked around in undergarments and barefoot for the past three years , as an object lesson and omen pertaining to Egypt and Cush ,
dia ho toy izany no hitondran' ny mpanjakan' i Asyria ny Egyptiana ho babo sy ny Etiopiana ho sambotra , na tanora na antitra , samy tsy hitafy sady tsy hikiraro no tsy hisarom @-@ pe , ho henatr' i Egypta . ||| so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush , both young and old . They will be in undergarments and barefoot , with the buttocks exposed ; the Egyptians will be publicly humiliated .
Ary ho raiki @-@ tahotra sy ho menatra ny Isiraely @* noho ny amin' i Etiopia fanantenany sy Egypta reharehany . ||| Those who put their hope in Cush and took pride in Egypt will be afraid and embarrassed .
Ary amin' izany andro izany ny mponina etỳ amoron @-@ dranomasina dia hanao hoe @: He ! ity manjo ilay nantenaintsika sady nandosirantsika ho famonjena antsika ho afaka amin' ny mpanjakan' i Asyria ! Aiza intsony re no handosirantsika ? ||| At that time those who live on this coast will say , ‘ Look what has happened to our source of hope to whom we fled for help , expecting to be rescued from the king of Assyria ! How can we escape now ? ’ @"
