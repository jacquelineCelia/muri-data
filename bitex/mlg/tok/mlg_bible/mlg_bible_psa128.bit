 ||| How blessed is every one of the Lord 's loyal followers , each one who keeps his commands !
Fa hohaninao tokoa ny asan' ny tananao ; Sambatra sady ambinina ianao . ||| You will eat what you worked so hard to grow . You will be blessed and secure .
Ny vadinao dia tahaka ny voaloboka mahavokatra Ao anatin' ny tranonao ; Ny zanakao dia tahaka ny zanak' oliva Manodidina ny latabatrao . ||| Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the inner rooms of your house ; your children will be like olive branches , as they sit all around your table .
Indro , fa toy izany no hitahiana Izay lehilahy matahotra an' i Jehovah . ||| Yes indeed , the man who fears the Lord will be blessed in this way .
Hitahy anao avy any Ziona anie Jehovah ; Ary ho faly hahita ny fahasoavan' i Jerosalema anie ianao Amin' ny andro rehetra hiainanao . ||| May the Lord bless you from Zion , that you might see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life ,
Eny , hahita ny zafinao anie ianao ; Fiadanana anie ho amin' ny Isiraely . ||| and that you might see your grandchildren . May Israel experience peace !
