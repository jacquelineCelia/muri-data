Ary rehefa niherina ny taona , ka mby amin' ny andro fandehanan' ny mpanjaka hiady , dia nitondra ny miaramila rehetra Joaba ka nandrava ny tanin' ny taranak' i Amona , dia tonga izy ka nanao fahirano an' i Raba ; fa Davida kosa nijanona tany Jerosalema ihany . Ary Joaba nahafaka an' i Raba , ka dia nandrava azy . ||| In the spring , at the time when kings normally conduct wars , Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites . He went and besieged Rabbah , while David stayed in Jerusalem . Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down .
Dia nesorin' i Davida ny satro @-@ boninahitr' ilay mpanjaka @* teo an @-@ dohany , ka hitany fa talenta volamena iray no lanjany , sady nisy vato soa , ary dia nisatrohan' i Davida . Ary navoakany ny babo azo tao an @-@ tanàna ka be dia be . ||| David took the crown from the head of their king and wore it ( its weight was a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones ) . He took a large amount of plunder from the city .
Ary dia navoakany koa ny olona izay tao , ka nasiany @* tamin' ny tsofa sy tamin' ny fangao @-@ by lehibe sy ny famaky ; toy izany no nataon' i Davida tamin' ny tanànan' ny taranak' i Amona rehetra . Ary Davida sy ny vahoaka rehetra dia niverina nankany Jerosalema . ||| He removed the city 's residents and made them do hard labor with saws , iron picks , and axes . This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities . Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem . Battles with the Philistines
Ary nony afaka izany , dia nisy ady tamin' ny Filistina tao Gazera ; tamin' izany no namonoan' i Sibekay Hosatita an' i Sipay , izay isan' ny taranaky ny Refaita , ka dia naetriny ny Filistina . ||| Later there was a battle with the Philistines in Gezer . At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai , one of the descendants of the Rephaim , and the Philistines were subdued .
Ary dia nisy ady tamin' ny Filistina indray ary Elanana , zanak' i Jaira , namono an' i Lamy , rahalahin' i Goliata Gatita , izay nanan @-@ jaran @-@ defona tahaka ny vodi @-@ tenon' ny mpanenona . ||| There was another battle with the Philistines in which Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite , whose spear had a shaft as big as the crossbeam of a weaver 's loom .
Ary nisy ady indray tao Gata ; ary tao nisy lehilahy vaventibe izay enin @-@ drantsana , ka dia efatra amby roa @-@ polo no isan' ny rantsan @-@ tànany sy ny rantsan @-@ tongony ; ary izy koa mba isan' ny taranaky ny Refaita . ||| In a battle in Gath there was a large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot - twenty @-@ four in all ! He too was a descendant of Rapha .
Ary nony nihaika ny Isiraely izy , dia nahafaty azy Jonatana , zanak' i Simea , rahalahin' i Davida . ||| When he taunted Israel , Jonathan son of Shimea , David 's brother , killed him .
Ireo no taranaky ny Refaita tao Gata , ka matin' ny tànan' i Davida sy ny tanan' ny mpanompony ireo . ||| These were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath ; they were killed by the hand of David and his soldiers .
