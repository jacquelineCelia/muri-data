Tamin' izany andro izany no nampitondran' i Merodaka @-@ baladana , zanak' i Baladana , mpanjakan' i Babylona , taratasy sy fanomezana ho an' i Hezekia ; fa efa reny fa narary izy ka sitrana . ||| At that time Merodach @-@ Baladan son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah , for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered .
Ary dia faly Hezekia noho izany ka nampiseho azy ny trano fitehirizany zava @-@ tsoa , dia volafotsy sy volamena sy zava @-@ manitra ary menaka tsara , sy ny trano fitehirizana ny fiadiany rehetra mbamin' izay rehetra tao amin' ny firaketany ; tsy nisy zavatra tsy nasehon' i Hezekia azy , na ny tao an @-@ tranony , na ny tao amin' ny fanjakany rehetra . ||| Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his storehouse with its silver , gold , spices , and high @-@ quality olive oil , as well as his whole armory and everything in his treasuries . Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom .
Dia nankany amin' i Hezekia mpanjaka mpaminany ka nanao taminy hoe @: Ahoana no nolazain' ireo olona ireo , ary avy taiza nihaviany hankatỳ aminao ? Ary hoy Hezekia @: Nankaty amiko avy tany an @-@ tany lavitra izy , dia avy tany Babylona . ||| Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him , "@ What did these men say ? Where do they come from ? @" Hezekiah replied , "@ They come from the distant land of Babylon . @"
Dia hoy izy @: Ka inona avy anefa no hitany tato ananonao ? Ary hoy Hezekia @: Izay rehetra an @-@ tranoko dia efa hitany avokoa ; tsy nisy zavatra tsy nasehoko azy ny ao amin' ny firaketako rehetra . ||| Isaiah asked , "@ What have they seen in your palace ? @" Hezekiah replied , "@ They have seen everything in my palace . I showed them everything in my treasuries . @"
Ary hoy Isaia tamin' i Hezekia @: Henoy ny tenin' i Jehovah , Tompon' ny maro @: ||| Isaiah said to Hezekiah , "@ Listen to the word of the Lord who commands armies @:
Indro , avy ny andro , ka ho entina ho any Babylona izay rehetra ao an @-@ tranonao sy izay rehetra noharin' ny razanao ka voatahiry mandraka androany ; eny , tsy hisy sisa hijanona inona na inona , hoy Jehovah . ||| ‘ Look , a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon ; nothing will be left , ’ says the Lord .
Ary na dia terakao aza dia hisy ho entiny koa , ka ho tandonaka @* any amin' ny lapan' ny mpanjakan' i Babylona ireo . ||| ‘ Some of your very own descendants whom you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon . ’ @"
Dia hoy Hezekia tamin' Isaia @: Tsara ny tenin' i Jehovah izay nolazainao . Ary hoy koa izy @: Eny , hisy fiadanana amin' ny androko handry fahizay . ||| Hezekiah said to Isaiah , "@ The Lord 's word which you have announced is appropriate . @" Then he thought , "@ For there will be peace and stability during my lifetime . @"
