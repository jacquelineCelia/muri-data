 ||| "@ If the Lord had not been on our side @" - let Israel say this ! -
Raha tsy Jehovah no nomba antsika , Raha nitsangana hamely antsika ny olona . ||| if the Lord had not been on our side , when men attacked us ,
Dia nitelina antsika velona izy , Raha nirehitra tamintsika ny fahatezerany ; ||| they would have swallowed us alive , when their anger raged against us .
Dia nandifotra antsika ny rano , Ary nanafotra ny fanahintsika ny riaka ; ||| The water would have overpowered us ; the current would have overwhelmed us .
Eny , nanafotra ny fanahintsika Ny rano misafoaka . ||| The raging water would have overwhelmed us .
Isaorana anie Jehovah , Izay tsy nanolotra antsika ho rembin' ny nifiny . ||| The Lord deserves praise , for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth .
Ny fanahintsika dia efa afaka tahaka ny vorona afaka tamin' ny fandriky ny mpihaza @: Tapaka ny fandrika , ka afaka isika . ||| We escaped with our lives , like a bird from a hunter 's snare . The snare broke , and we escaped .
Ny famonjena antsika dia amin' ny anaran' i Jehovah , Mpanao ny lanitra sy ny tany . ||| Our deliverer is the Lord , the Creator of heaven and earth .
