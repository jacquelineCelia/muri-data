 ||| In my distress I cried out to the Lord and he answered me .
Jehovah ô , vonjeo ny fanahiko amin' ny molotra mandainga , Eny , amin' ny lela mamitaka ||| I said , "@ O Lord , rescue me from those who lie with their lips and those who deceive with their tongue .
Inona no homeny anao , ary inona koa no hataony aminao , Ry lela mamitaka ? ||| How will he severely punish you , you deceptive talker ?
Zana @-@ tsipìkan' ny mahery sady voaranitra , Mbamin' ny vain' afon' anjavidy*. ||| Here 's how ! With the sharp arrows of warriors , with arrowheads forged over the hot coals .
Lozako , fa mivahiny eto amin' ny Maseka aho Ary mitoetra ato an @-@ dain' ny Kedarita ! ||| How miserable I am ! For I have lived temporarily in Meshech ; I have resided among the tents of Kedar .
Ela loatra izay no nitoeran' ny fanahiko teo amin' Izay tsy tia fihavanana . ||| For too long I have had to reside with those who hate peace .
Raha izaho , dia fihavanana ; Kanjo nony miteny aho , dia mila ady kosa ireny . ||| I am committed to peace , but when I speak , they want to make war .
