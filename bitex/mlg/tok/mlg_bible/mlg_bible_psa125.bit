 ||| Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion ; it can not be upended and will endure forever .
Tahaka ny tendrombohitra manodidina an' i Jerosalema No anodidinan' i Jehovah ny olony Hatramin' izao ka ho mandrakizay ||| As the mountains surround Jerusalem , so the Lord surrounds his people , now and forevermore .
Fa tsy hitoetra eo amin' ny anjaran' ny marina ny tehim @-@ panjakan' ny ratsy fanahy , Fandrao ny marina haninjitra ny tànany hanendry zava @-@ dratsy . ||| Indeed , the scepter of a wicked king will not settle upon the allotted land of the godly . Otherwise the godly might do what is wrong .
Jehovah ô , manaova soa amin' ny tsara Sy ny mahitsy fo . ||| Do good , O Lord , to those who are good , to the morally upright !
Fa izay mivily ho amin' ny sakeli @-@ dalana mivilivily Dia horoahin' i Jehovah miaraka amin' ny mpanao ratsy anie . Fiadanana anie ho amin' ny Isiraely . ||| As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path , may the Lord remove them , along with those who behave wickedly ! May Israel experience peace !
