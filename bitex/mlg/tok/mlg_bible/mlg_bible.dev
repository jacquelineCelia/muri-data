The women and children also rejoiced . The rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard from far away .
Ary izy niantso an' i Johanana , zanak' i Karea , sy ny mpifehy ny miaramila rehetra izay teo aminy mbamin' ny olona rehetra , na kely na lehibe , ||| So Jeremiah summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people of every class .
Ary nony efa lasa nandeha ireo , indro , nisy anjelin' ny Tompo niseho tamin' i Josefa tamin' ny nofy ka nanan hoe @: Mifohaza ianao , ka ento ny Zazakely sy ny reniny , dia mandosira any Egypta , ary mitoera any ambara @-@ pilazako aminao ; fa Heroda efa hitady ny Zazakely hovonoiny . ||| After they had gone , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , "@ Get up , take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt , and stay there until I tell you , for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him . @"

Fa ny amin' ny olona izay sisa tany amin' ny tanin' ny Joda , izay navelan' i Nebokadnezara , mpanjakan' i Babylona , dia Gedalia , zanak' i Ahikama , zanak' i Safana , no notendreny ho mpanapaka azy . ||| Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , as governor over the people whom he allowed to remain in the land of Judah .
Ary ny Fialofana tamin' ny Sabata , izay natao teo akaikin' ny trano , sy ny fidirana ivelany izay an' ny mpanjaka , dia nafindrany ho ao an @-@ tranon' i Jehovah noho ny tahony ny mpanjakan' i Asyria . ||| He also removed the Sabbath awning that had been built in the temple and the king 's outer entranceway , on account of the king of Assyria .
Fa hotsarainy amin' ny fahamarinana ny malahelo ; Ary homeny rariny ny mpandefitra amin' ny tany ; hamely ny tany amin' ny tsorakazon' ny vavany Izy , ary ny fofonain' ny molony no hamonoany ny ratsy fanahy . ||| He will treat the poor fairly , and make right decisions for the downtrodden of the earth . He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth , and order the wicked to be executed .
Dia niresaka hoe izy @: Tsy nangorakoraka va ny fontsika , raha niresaka tamintsika teny an @-@ dalana Izy ka namoaka ny hevitry ny Soratra Masina tamintsika ? ||| They said to each other , "@ Did n't our hearts burn within us while he was speaking with us on the road , while he was explaining the scriptures to us ? @"

Nefa namaky onja fatratra ny olona mba hamerina ny sambo ho amin' ny tany maina , fa tsy zakany , satria ny ranomasina mbola nihananonja mafy taminy . ||| Instead , they tried to row back to land , but they were not able to do so because the storm kept growing worse and worse .
dia izay tsy nalain' i Nebokadnezara mpanjakan' i Babylona , fony izy nitondra an' i Jekonia , zanak' i Joiakima , mpanjakan' ny Joda , ho babo avy tany Jerosalema ho any Babylona , mbamin' ny manan @-@ kaja rehetra amin' ny Joda sy Jerosalema , ||| He has already spoken about these things that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiakim 's son King Jeconiah of Judah and the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem away as captives .
Fa rehefa voalazan' i Mosesy tamin' ny vahoaka rehetra ny didy rehetra araka ny lalàna , dia nalainy ny ran @-@ janak' omby sy ny ran' osilahy mbamin' ny rano sy ny volon' ondry jaky sy ny hysopa ka nafafiny tamin' ny boky sy ny vahoaka rehetra ; ||| For when Moses had spoken every command to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
Ary , indro , ny efitra lamba tao amin' ny tempoly dia triatra nizara roa hatrany ambony ka hatrany ambany ; dia nihorohoro ny tany , ka nitresaka ny vatolampy ; ||| Just then the temple curtain was torn in two , from top to bottom . The earth shook and the rocks were split apart .
Eo amin' ny fanaovan @-@ jiro volamena tsara no handaharany ny lela fanaovan @-@ jiro mandrakariva eo anatrehan' i Jehovah . ||| On the ceremonially pure lampstand he must arrange the lamps before the Lord continually .
