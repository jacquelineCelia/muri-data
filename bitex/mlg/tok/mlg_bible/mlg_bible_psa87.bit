Salamo nataon' ny Koraita . Tonon @-@ kira . Ny naorin' i Jehovah dia ao an @-@ tendrombohitra masina ; ||| The Lord 's city is in the holy hills .
Ny vavahadin' i Ziona dia tian' i Jehovah mihoatra noho ny fonenana rehetra izay an' i Jakoba . ||| The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob .
Zava @-@ malaza no anambarana anao Ry tan√†nan' Andriamanitra ||| People say wonderful things about you , O city of God . ( Selah )
Hanonona an-dRahaba* sy Babylona Aho ho isan' izay mahalala ahy ; Indro Filistia sy Tyro mbamin' i Etiopia , Ity no efa teraka teo . ||| I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers . Here are Philistia and Tyre , along with Ethiopia . It is said of them , "@ This one was born there . @"
Ary Ziona hilazana hoe @: Ireto sy ireroa samy efa teraka teo ; Ary ny Avo Indrindra no mampitoetra azy . ||| But it is said of Zion 's residents , "@ Each one of these was born in her , and the sovereign One makes her secure . @"
Jehovah hanisa , raha manoratra ny firenena Izy @: Ity no efa teraka teo . ||| The Lord writes in the census book of the nations , "@ This one was born there . @" ( Selah )
Hoy izay mihira sy mandihy @: Ny loharanoko rehetra dia ao aminao . ||| As for the singers , as well as the pipers - all of them sing within your walls .
