Dimy amby roa @-@ polo taona Jotama , fony izy vao nanjaka , ary enina ambin' ny folo taona no nanjakany tany Jerosalema . Ary ny anaran @-@ dreniny dia Jerosa , zanakavavin' i Zadoka . ||| Jotham was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem . His mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok .
Ary nanao izay mahitsy eo imason' i Jehovah izy , tahaka izay nataon' i Ozia rainy ; nefa kosa tsy mba niditra tao amin' ny tempolin' i Jehovah izy . Ary ny vahoaka rehetra mbola nanao ratsy ihany . ||| He did what the Lord approved , just as his father Uzziah had done . ( He did not , however , have the audacity to enter the temple . ) Yet the people were still sinning .
Izy no nanamboatra ny vavahady ambony amin' ny tranon' i Jehovah sady nandrafitra be tamin' ny mandan' i Ofela koa . ||| He built the Upper Gate to the Lord 's temple and did a lot of work on the wall in the area known as Ophel .
Ary nanao tanàna teny amin' ny tany havoan' i Joda sy trano fiarovana ary tilikambo tany an' ala koa izy . ||| He built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests .
Ary niady tamin' ny mpanjakan' ny taranak' i Amona koa izy ka naharesy azy . Ary tamin' izany taona izany ny taranak' i Amona nanome azy talenta volafotsy zato ary vary tritika sy vary hordea iray alina kora avy ; izany no naloan' ny taranak' i Amona ho azy tamin' ny @-@ taona faharoa sy fahatelo koa . ||| He launched a military campaign against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them . That year the Ammonites paid him 100 talents of silver , 10,000 kors of wheat , and 10,000 kors of barley . The Ammonites also paid this same amount of annual tribute the next two years .
Ary dia nitombo hery Jotama , satria nizotra tsara teo anatrehan' i Jehovah Andriamaniny izy . ||| Jotham grew powerful because he was determined to please the Lord his God .
Ary ny tantaran' i Jotama sisa mbamin' ny adiny rehetra sy ny fanaony , indro , efa voasoratra ao amin' ny bokin' ny mpanjakan' ny Isiraely sy ny Joda izany . ||| The rest of the events of Jotham 's reign , including all his military campaigns and his accomplishments , are recorded in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah .
Dimy amby roa @-@ polo taona izy , fony vao nanjaka , ary enina ambin' ny folo taona no nanjakany tany Jerosalema . ||| He was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem .
Ary Jotama lasa nodi @-@ mandry any amin' ny razany , dia nalevina tany an @-@ Tanànan' i Davida izy ; ary Ahaza zanany no nanjaka nandimby azy . ||| Jotham passed away and was buried in the City of David . His son Ahaz replaced him as king .
