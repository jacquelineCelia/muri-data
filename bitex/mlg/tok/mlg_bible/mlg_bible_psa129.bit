 ||| "@ Since my youth they have often attacked me , " let Israel say .
Mafy no nampahoriany ahy hatry ny fony aho mbola tanora ; Nefa tsy naharesy ahy izy . ||| "@ Since my youth they have often attacked me , but they have not defeated me .
Ny mpiasa dia niasa ny lamosiko ; Efa nanalava ny vavasany izy . ||| The plowers plowed my back ; they made their furrows long .
Marina Jehovah @: Efa nanapaka ny famatorana nataon' ny ratsy fanahy Izy . ||| The Lord is just ; he cut the ropes of the wicked . @"
Aoka ho menatra sy hiamboho Izay rehetra mandrafy an' i Ziona ||| May all who hate Zion be humiliated and turned back !
Ka ho tahaka ny ahitra eo an @-@ tampon @-@ trano . Izay malazo , na dia tsy misy manongotra azy aza ; ||| May they be like the grass on the rooftops which withers before one can even pull it up ,
Tsy misy mpijinja mameno tanana Na mpamehy amboara mameno tratra amin' izany ; ||| which can not fill the reaper 's hand , or the lap of the one who gathers the grain !
Ka dia tsy hisy mpandalo hanao hoe @: Hotahin' i Jehovah anie ianareo ; Eny , ny anaran' i Jehovah no itsofanay rano anareo . ||| Those who pass by will not say , "@ May you experience the Lord 's blessing ! We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the Lord . @"
