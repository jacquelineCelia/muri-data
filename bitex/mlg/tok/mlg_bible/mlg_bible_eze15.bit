Ary tonga tamiko ny tenin' i Jehovah nanao hoe @: ||| The word of the Lord came to me @:
Ry zanak' olona , inona no ihoaran' ny tahom @-@ boaloboka noho ny hazo rehetra , dia ny sakeli @-@ boaloboka izay isan' ny hazo any an' ala ? ||| "@ Son of man , of all the woody branches among the trees of the forest , what happens to the wood of the vine ?
Moa mba fangalan @-@ kazo hatao zavatra akory va izy , na mba fangalana fihantonan @-@ javatra ? ||| Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful ? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on ?
Indro , hatsipy any anaty afo hataina izy ; ny laniny roa ho levon' ny afo , ary ny tenatenany ho may . Ka moa azo atao zavatra akory va izy ? ||| No ! It is thrown in the fire for fuel ; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle , will it be useful for anything ?
Indro , fony izy tsy mbola nahafahana aza , dia tsy azo natao zavatra , koa mainka fa rehefa levon' ny afo sy may izy ? ||| Indeed ! If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole , how much less can it be made into anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred ?
Koa izao no lazain' i Jehovah Tompo @: Toy ny tahom @-@ boaloboka amin' ny hazo any an' ala , izay natolotro hataina , dia toy izany no hanolorako ny mponina any Jerosalema . ||| "@ Therefore , this is what the sovereign Lord says @: Like the wood of the vine is among the trees of the forest which I have provided as fuel for the fire - so I will provide the residents of Jerusalem as fuel .
Ary hanandrina azy ny tavako ; hiala avy amin' ny afo izy nefa ho levon' ny afo hafa indray ; ka dia ho fantatrareo fa Izaho no Jehovah , raha manandrina azy ny tavako . ||| I will set my face against them - although they have escaped from the fire , the fire will still consume them ! Then you will know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them .
Ary hataoko lao ny tany noho ny nivadihany tamiko , hoy Jehovah Tompo . ||| I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully , declares the sovereign Lord . @"
