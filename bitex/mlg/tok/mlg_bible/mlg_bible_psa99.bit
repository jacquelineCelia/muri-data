Jehovah no Mpanjaka aoka hangovitra ny firenena ; Mipetraka amin' ny kerobima Izy , aoka hihorohoro ny tany . ||| The Lord reigns ! The nations tremble . He sits enthroned above the winged angels ; the earth shakes .
Lehibe any Ziona Jehovah ; Ary avo ambonin' ny firenena rehetra Izy . ||| The Lord is elevated in Zion ; he is exalted over all the nations .
Aoka hidera ny anaranao lehibe sy mahatahotra ireo ; Fa masina Jehovah . ||| Let them praise your great and awesome name ! He is holy !
Ny herin' ny mpanjaka dia tia rariny ; Ampitoerinao ny fahitsiana ; Fitsarana sy fahamarinana no ataonao eo amin' i Jakoba . ||| The king is strong ; he loves justice . You ensure that legal decisions will be made fairly ; you promote justice and equity in Jacob .
Manandrata an' i Jehovah Andriamanitsika ianareo , Ka miankohofa eo amin' ny fitoeran @-@ tongony ; Fa masina Izy . ||| Praise the Lord our God ! Worship before his footstool ! He is holy !
Mosesy sy Arona tamin' ny mpisorony , Ary Samoela tamin' izay mpiantso ny anarany , Niantso an' i Jehovah ireo , ary namaly @: azy Izy . ||| Moses and Aaron were among his priests ; Samuel was one of those who prayed to him . They prayed to the Lord and he answered them .
Niteny taminy tao anatin' ny andri @-@ rahona Izy ; Nitandrina ny teni @-@ vavolombelony izy ireo , Dia ny didy izay efa nomeny azy . ||| He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud ; they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them .
Jehovah Andriamanitray Ã´ , Hianao no namaly ny nataony ; Andriamanitra , Mpamela ny helony , Hianao , Na dia namaly azy noho ny nataony aza . ||| O Lord our God , you answered them . They found you to be a forgiving God , but also one who punished their sinful deeds .
Asandrato Jehovah Andriamanitsika , Ary miankohofa eo an @-@ tendrombohiny masina ; Fa masina Jehovah Andriamanitsika . ||| Praise the Lord our God ! Worship on his holy hill , for the Lord our God is holy !
