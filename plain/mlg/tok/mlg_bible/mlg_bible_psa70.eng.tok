O God , please be willing to rescue me ! O Lord , hurry and help me ! <EOS>
May those who are trying to take my life be embarrassed and ashamed ! May those who want to harm me be turned back and ashamed ! <EOS>
May those who say , "@ Aha ! Aha ! @" be driven back and disgraced ! <EOS>
May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you ! May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually , "@ May God be praised ! @" <EOS>
I am oppressed and needy ! O God , hurry to me ! You are my helper and my deliverer ! O Lord , do not delay ! <EOS>
