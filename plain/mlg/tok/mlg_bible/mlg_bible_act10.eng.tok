Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius , a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort . <EOS>
He was a devout , God @-@ fearing man , as was all his household ; he did many acts of charity for the people and prayed to God regularly . <EOS>
About three o'clock one afternoon he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him , "@ Cornelius . @" <EOS>
Staring at him and becoming greatly afraid , Cornelius replied , "@ What is it , Lord ? @" The angel said to him , "@ Your prayers and your acts of charity have gone up as a memorial before God . <EOS>
Now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon , who is called Peter . <EOS>
This man is staying as a guest with a man named Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the sea . @" <EOS>
When the angel who had spoken to him departed , Cornelius called two of his personal servants and a devout soldier from among those who served him , <EOS>
and when he had explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa . <EOS>
About noon the next day , while they were on their way and approaching the city , Peter went up on the roof to pray . <EOS>
He became hungry and wanted to eat , but while they were preparing the meal , a trance came over him . <EOS>
He saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet descending , being let down to earth by its four corners . <EOS>
In it were all kinds of four @-@ footed animals and reptiles of the earth and wild birds . <EOS>
Then a voice said to him , "@ Get up , Peter ; slaughter and eat ! @" <EOS>
But Peter said , "@ Certainly not , Lord , for I have never eaten anything defiled and ritually unclean ! @" <EOS>
The voice spoke to him again , a second time , "@ What God has made clean , you must not consider ritually unclean ! @" <EOS>
This happened three times , and immediately the object was taken up into heaven . <EOS>
Now while Peter was puzzling over what the vision he had seen could signify , the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon 's house was and approached the gate . <EOS>
They called out to ask if Simon , known as Peter , was staying there as a guest . <EOS>
While Peter was still thinking seriously about the vision , the Spirit said to him , "@ Look ! Three men are looking for you . <EOS>
But get up , go down , and accompany them without hesitation , because I have sent them . @" <EOS>
So Peter went down to the men and said , "@ Here I am , the person you 're looking for . Why have you come ? @" <EOS>
They said , "@ Cornelius the centurion , a righteous and God @-@ fearing man , well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation , was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you . @" <EOS>
So Peter invited them in and entertained them as guests . On the next day he got up and set out with them , and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him . <EOS>
The following day he entered Caesarea . Now Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had called together his relatives and close friends . <EOS>
So when Peter came in , Cornelius met him , fell at his feet , and worshiped him . <EOS>
But Peter helped him up , saying , "@ Stand up . I too am a mere mortal . @" <EOS>
Peter continued talking with him as he went in , and he found many people gathered together . <EOS>
He said to them , "@ You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile , yet God has shown me that I should call no person defiled or ritually unclean . <EOS>
Therefore when you sent for me , I came without any objection . Now may I ask why you sent for me ? @" <EOS>
Cornelius replied , "@ Four days ago at this very hour , at three o'clock in the afternoon , I was praying in my house , and suddenly a man in shining clothing stood before me <EOS>
and said , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your acts of charity have been remembered before God . <EOS>
Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is called Peter . This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon the tanner , by the sea . ’ <EOS>
Therefore I sent for you at once , and you were kind enough to come . So now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to say to us . @" <EOS>
Then Peter started speaking @: "@ I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism in dealing with people , <EOS>
but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is welcomed before him . <EOS>
You know the message he sent to the people of Israel , proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ ( he is Lord of all ) - <EOS>
you know what happened throughout Judea , beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John announced @: <EOS>
with respect to Jesus from Nazareth , that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power . He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , because God was with him . <EOS>
We are witnesses of all the things he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem . They killed him by hanging him on a tree , <EOS>
but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen , <EOS>
not by all the people , but by us , the witnesses God had already chosen , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead . <EOS>
He commanded us to preach to the people and to warn them that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead . <EOS>
About him all the prophets testify , that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . @" The Gentiles Receive the Holy Spirit <EOS>
While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the message . <EOS>
The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were greatly astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles , <EOS>
for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God . Then Peter said , <EOS>
"@ No one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized , who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did , can he ? @" <EOS>
So he gave orders to have them baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay for several days . <EOS>
