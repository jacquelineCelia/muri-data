The Lord is my shepherd , I lack nothing . <EOS>
He takes me to lush pastures , he leads me to refreshing water . <EOS>
He restores my strength . He leads me down the right paths for the sake of his reputation . <EOS>
Even when I must walk through the darkest valley , I fear no danger , for you are with me ; your rod and your staff reassure me . <EOS>
You prepare a feast before me in plain sight of my enemies . You refresh my head with oil ; my cup is completely full . <EOS>
Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all my days , and I will live in the Lord 's house for the rest of my life . <EOS>
