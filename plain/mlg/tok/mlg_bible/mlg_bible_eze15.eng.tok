The word of the Lord came to me @: <EOS>
"@ Son of man , of all the woody branches among the trees of the forest , what happens to the wood of the vine ? <EOS>
Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful ? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on ? <EOS>
No ! It is thrown in the fire for fuel ; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle , will it be useful for anything ? <EOS>
Indeed ! If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole , how much less can it be made into anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred ? <EOS>
"@ Therefore , this is what the sovereign Lord says @: Like the wood of the vine is among the trees of the forest which I have provided as fuel for the fire - so I will provide the residents of Jerusalem as fuel . <EOS>
I will set my face against them - although they have escaped from the fire , the fire will still consume them ! Then you will know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them . <EOS>
I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully , declares the sovereign Lord . @" <EOS>
