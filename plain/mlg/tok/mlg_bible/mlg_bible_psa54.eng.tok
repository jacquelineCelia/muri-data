O God , deliver me by your name ! Vindicate me by your power ! <EOS>
O God , listen to my prayer ! Pay attention to what I say ! <EOS>
For foreigners attack me ; ruthless men , who do not respect God , seek my life . ( Selah ) <EOS>
Look , God is my deliverer ! The Lord is among those who support me . <EOS>
May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil ! As a demonstration of your faithfulness , destroy them ! <EOS>
With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you ! I will give thanks to your name , O Lord , for it is good ! <EOS>
Surely he rescues me from all trouble , and I triumph over my enemies . <EOS>
