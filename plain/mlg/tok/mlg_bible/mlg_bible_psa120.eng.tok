In my distress I cried out to the Lord and he answered me . <EOS>
I said , "@ O Lord , rescue me from those who lie with their lips and those who deceive with their tongue . <EOS>
How will he severely punish you , you deceptive talker ? <EOS>
Here 's how ! With the sharp arrows of warriors , with arrowheads forged over the hot coals . <EOS>
How miserable I am ! For I have lived temporarily in Meshech ; I have resided among the tents of Kedar . <EOS>
For too long I have had to reside with those who hate peace . <EOS>
I am committed to peace , but when I speak , they want to make war . <EOS>
