"@ If the Lord had not been on our side @" - let Israel say this ! - <EOS>
if the Lord had not been on our side , when men attacked us , <EOS>
they would have swallowed us alive , when their anger raged against us . <EOS>
The water would have overpowered us ; the current would have overwhelmed us . <EOS>
The raging water would have overwhelmed us . <EOS>
The Lord deserves praise , for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth . <EOS>
We escaped with our lives , like a bird from a hunter 's snare . The snare broke , and we escaped . <EOS>
Our deliverer is the Lord , the Creator of heaven and earth . <EOS>
