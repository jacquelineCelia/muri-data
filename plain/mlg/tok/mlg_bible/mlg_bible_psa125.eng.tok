Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion ; it can not be upended and will endure forever . <EOS>
As the mountains surround Jerusalem , so the Lord surrounds his people , now and forevermore . <EOS>
Indeed , the scepter of a wicked king will not settle upon the allotted land of the godly . Otherwise the godly might do what is wrong . <EOS>
Do good , O Lord , to those who are good , to the morally upright ! <EOS>
As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path , may the Lord remove them , along with those who behave wickedly ! May Israel experience peace ! <EOS>
