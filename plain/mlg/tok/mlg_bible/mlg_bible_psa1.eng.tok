How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked , or stand in the pathway with sinners , or sit in the assembly of scoffers ! <EOS>
Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lord 's commands ; he meditates on his commands day and night . <EOS>
He is like a tree planted by flowing streams ; it yields its fruit at the proper time , and its leaves never fall off . He succeeds in everything he attempts . <EOS>
Not so with the wicked ! Instead they are like wind @-@ driven chaff . <EOS>
For this reason the wicked can not withstand judgment , nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly . <EOS>
Certainly the Lord guards the way of the godly , but the way of the wicked ends in destruction . <EOS>
