Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes . <EOS>
This was the first registration , taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria . <EOS>
Everyone went to his own town to be registered . <EOS>
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea , to the city of David called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family line of David . <EOS>
He went to be registered with Mary , who was promised in marriage to him , and who was expecting a child . <EOS>
While they were there , the time came for her to deliver her child . <EOS>
And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger , because there was no place for them in the inn . The Shepherds ' Visit <EOS>
Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field , keeping guard over their flock at night . <EOS>
An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were absolutely terrified . <EOS>
But the angel said to them , "@ Do not be afraid ! Listen carefully , for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people @: <EOS>
Today your Savior is born in the city of David . He is Christ the Lord . <EOS>
This will be a sign for you @: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger . @" <EOS>
Suddenly a vast , heavenly army appeared with the angel , praising God and saying , <EOS>
"@ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased ! @" <EOS>
When the angels left them and went back to heaven , the shepherds said to one another , "@ Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place , that the Lord has made known to us . @" <EOS>
So they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph , and found the baby lying in a manger . <EOS>
When they saw him , they related what they had been told about this child , <EOS>
and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said . <EOS>
But Mary treasured up all these words , pondering in her heart what they might mean . <EOS>
So the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen ; everything was just as they had been told . <EOS>
At the end of eight days , when he was circumcised , he was named Jesus , the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb . Jesus ' Presentation at the Temple <EOS>
Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses , Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord <EOS>
( just as it is written in the law of the Lord , " Every firstborn male will be set apart to the Lord " ) , <EOS>
and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord , a pair of doves or two young pigeons . The Prophecy of Simeon <EOS>
Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout , looking for the restoration of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him . <EOS>
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord 's Christ . <EOS>
So Simeon , directed by the Spirit , came into the temple courts , and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law , <EOS>
Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God , saying , <EOS>
"@ Now , according to your word , Sovereign Lord , permit your servant to depart in peace . <EOS>
For my eyes have seen your salvation <EOS>
that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples @: <EOS>
a light , for revelation to the Gentiles , and for glory to your people Israel . @" <EOS>
So the child 's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him . <EOS>
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary , "@ Listen carefully @: This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected . <EOS>
Indeed , as a result of him the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed - and a sword will pierce your own soul as well ! @" The Testimony of Anna <EOS>
There was also a prophetess , Anna the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very old , having been married to her husband for seven years until his death . <EOS>
She had lived as a widow since then for eighty @-@ four years . She never left the temple , worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day . <EOS>
At that moment , she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem . <EOS>
So when Joseph and Mary had performed everything according to the law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee , to their own town of Nazareth . <EOS>
And the child grew and became strong , filled with wisdom , and the favor of God was upon him . Jesus in the Temple <EOS>
Now Jesus ' parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of the Passover . <EOS>
When he was twelve years old , they went up according to custom . <EOS>
But when the feast was over , as they were returning home , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did not know it , <EOS>
but ( because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers ) they went a day 's journey . Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances . <EOS>
When they did not find him , they returned to Jerusalem to look for him . <EOS>
After three days they found him in the temple courts , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions . <EOS>
And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers . <EOS>
When his parents saw him , they were overwhelmed . His mother said to him , "@ Child , why have you treated us like this ? Look , your father and I have been looking for you anxiously . @" <EOS>
But he replied , "@ Why were you looking for me ? Did n't you know that I must be in my Father 's house ? @" <EOS>
Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them . <EOS>
Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth , and was obedient to them . But his mother kept all these things in her heart . <EOS>
And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature , and in favor with God and with people . <EOS>
