Why do you boast about your evil plans , O powerful man ? God 's loyal love protects me all day long ! <EOS>
Your tongue carries out your destructive plans ; it is as effective as a sharp razor , O deceiver . <EOS>
You love evil more than good , lies more than speaking the truth . ( Selah ) <EOS>
You love to use all the words that destroy , and the tongue that deceives . <EOS>
Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins . He will scoop you up and remove you from your home ; he will uproot you from the land of the living . ( Selah ) <EOS>
When the godly see this , they will be filled with awe , and will mock the evildoer , saying @: <EOS>
"@ Look , here is the man who would not make God his protector ! He trusted in his great wealth and was confident about his plans to destroy others . @" <EOS>
But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God ; I continually trust in God 's loyal love . <EOS>
I will continually thank you when you execute judgment ; I will rely on you , for your loyal followers know you are good . <EOS>
