How long , Lord , will you continue to ignore me ? How long will you pay no attention to me ? <EOS>
How long must I worry , and suffer in broad daylight ? How long will my enemy gloat over me ? <EOS>
Look at me ! Answer me , O Lord my God ! Revive me , or else I will die ! <EOS>
Then my enemy will say , "@ I have defeated him ! @" Then my foes will rejoice because I am upended . <EOS>
But I trust in your faithfulness . May I rejoice because of your deliverance ! <EOS>
I will sing praises to the Lord when he vindicates me . <EOS>
