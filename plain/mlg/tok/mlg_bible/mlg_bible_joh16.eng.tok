"@ I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away . <EOS>
They will put you out of the synagogue , yet a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is offering service to God . <EOS>
They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me . <EOS>
But I have told you these things so that when their time comes , you will remember that I told you about them . "@ I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you . <EOS>
But now I am going to the one who sent me , and not one of you is asking me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’ <EOS>
Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I have said these things to you . <EOS>
But I tell you the truth , it is to your advantage that I am going away . For if I do not go away , the Advocate will not come to you , but if I go , I will send him to you . <EOS>
And when he comes , he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment - <EOS>
concerning sin , because they do not believe in me ; <EOS>
concerning righteousness , because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer ; <EOS>
and concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world has been condemned . <EOS>
"@ I have many more things to say to you , but you can not bear them now . <EOS>
But when he , the Spirit of truth , comes , he will guide you into all truth . For he will not speak on his own authority , but will speak whatever he hears , and will tell you what is to come . <EOS>
He will glorify me , because he will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you . <EOS>
Everything that the Father has is mine ; that is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you . <EOS>
In a little while you will see me no longer ; again after a little while , you will see me . @" <EOS>
Then some of his disciples said to one another , "@ What is the meaning of what he is saying , ‘ In a little while you will not see me ; again after a little while , you will see me , ’ and , ‘ because I am going to the Father ’ ? @" <EOS>
So they kept on repeating , "@ What is the meaning of what he says , ‘ In a little while ’ ? We do not understand what he is talking about . @" <EOS>
Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things , so he said to them , "@ Are you asking each other about this - that I said , ‘ In a little while you will not see me ; again after a little while , you will see me ’ ? <EOS>
I tell you the solemn truth , you will weep and wail , but the world will rejoice ; you will be sad , but your sadness will turn into joy . <EOS>
When a woman gives birth , she has distress because her time has come , but when her child is born , she no longer remembers the suffering because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world . <EOS>
So also you have sorrow now , but I will see you again , and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you . <EOS>
At that time you will ask me nothing . I tell you the solemn truth , whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you . <EOS>
Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive it , so that your joy may be complete . <EOS>
"@ I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech ; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures , but will tell you plainly about the Father . <EOS>
At that time you will ask in my name , and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf . <EOS>
For the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God . <EOS>
I came from the Father and entered into the world , but in turn , I am leaving the world and going back to the Father . @" <EOS>
His disciples said , "@ Look , now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech ! <EOS>
Now we know that you know everything and do not need anyone to ask you anything . Because of this we believe that you have come from God . @" <EOS>
Jesus replied , "@ Do you now believe ? <EOS>
Look , a time is coming - and has come - when you will be scattered , each one to his own home , and I will be left alone . Yet I am not alone , because my Father is with me . <EOS>
I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace . In the world you have trouble and suffering , but take courage - I have conquered the world . @" <EOS>
