How blessed is every one of the Lord 's loyal followers , each one who keeps his commands ! <EOS>
You will eat what you worked so hard to grow . You will be blessed and secure . <EOS>
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the inner rooms of your house ; your children will be like olive branches , as they sit all around your table . <EOS>
Yes indeed , the man who fears the Lord will be blessed in this way . <EOS>
May the Lord bless you from Zion , that you might see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life , <EOS>
and that you might see your grandchildren . May Israel experience peace ! <EOS>
