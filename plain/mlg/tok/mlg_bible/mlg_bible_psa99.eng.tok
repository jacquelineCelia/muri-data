The Lord reigns ! The nations tremble . He sits enthroned above the winged angels ; the earth shakes . <EOS>
The Lord is elevated in Zion ; he is exalted over all the nations . <EOS>
Let them praise your great and awesome name ! He is holy ! <EOS>
The king is strong ; he loves justice . You ensure that legal decisions will be made fairly ; you promote justice and equity in Jacob . <EOS>
Praise the Lord our God ! Worship before his footstool ! He is holy ! <EOS>
Moses and Aaron were among his priests ; Samuel was one of those who prayed to him . They prayed to the Lord and he answered them . <EOS>
He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud ; they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them . <EOS>
O Lord our God , you answered them . They found you to be a forgiving God , but also one who punished their sinful deeds . <EOS>
Praise the Lord our God ! Worship on his holy hill , for the Lord our God is holy ! <EOS>
