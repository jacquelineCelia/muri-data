"@ Arise ! Shine ! For your light arrives ! The splendor of the Lord shines on you ! <EOS>
For , look , darkness covers the earth and deep darkness covers the nations , but the Lord shines on you ; his splendor appears over you . <EOS>
Nations come to your light , kings to your bright light . <EOS>
Look all around you ! They all gather and come to you - your sons come from far away and your daughters are escorted by guardians . <EOS>
Then you will look and smile , you will be excited and your heart will swell with pride . For the riches of distant lands will belong to you and the wealth of nations will come to you . <EOS>
Camel caravans will cover your roads , young camels from Midian and Ephah . All the merchants of Sheba will come , bringing gold and incense and singing praises to the Lord . <EOS>
All the sheep of Kedar will be gathered to you ; the rams of Nebaioth will be available to you as sacrifices . They will go up on my altar acceptably , and I will bestow honor on my majestic temple . <EOS>
Who are these who float along like a cloud , who fly like doves to their shelters ? <EOS>
Indeed , the coastlands look eagerly for me , the large ships are in the lead , bringing your sons from far away , along with their silver and gold , to honor the Lord your God , the Holy One of Israel , for he has bestowed honor on you . <EOS>
Foreigners will rebuild your walls ; their kings will serve you . Even though I struck you down in my anger , I will restore my favor and have compassion on you . <EOS>
Your gates will remain open at all times ; they will not be shut during the day or at night , so that the wealth of nations may be delivered , with their kings leading the way . <EOS>
Indeed , nations or kingdoms that do not serve you will perish ; such nations will be totally destroyed . <EOS>
The splendor of Lebanon will come to you , its evergreens , firs , and cypresses together , to beautify my palace ; I will bestow honor on my throne room . <EOS>
The children of your oppressors will come bowing to you ; all who treated you with disrespect will bow down at your feet . They will call you , ‘ The City of the Lord , Zion of the Holy One of Israel . ’ <EOS>
You were once abandoned and despised , with no one passing through , but I will make you a permanent source of pride and joy to coming generations . <EOS>
You will drink the milk of nations ; you will nurse at the breasts of kings . Then you will recognize that I , the Lord , am your deliverer , your protector , the powerful ruler of Jacob . <EOS>
Instead of bronze , I will bring you gold , instead of iron , I will bring you silver , instead of wood , I will bring you bronze , instead of stones , I will bring you iron . I will make prosperity your overseer , and vindication your sovereign ruler . <EOS>
Sounds of violence will no longer be heard in your land , or the sounds of destruction and devastation within your borders . You will name your walls , ‘ Deliverance , ’ and your gates , ‘ Praise . ’ <EOS>
The sun will no longer supply light for you by day , nor will the moon 's brightness shine on you ; the Lord will be your permanent source of light - the splendor of your God will shine upon you . <EOS>
Your sun will no longer set ; your moon will not disappear ; the Lord will be your permanent source of light ; your time of sorrow will be over . <EOS>
All of your people will be godly ; they will possess the land permanently . I will plant them like a shoot ; they will be the product of my labor , through whom I reveal my splendor . <EOS>
The least of you will multiply into a thousand ; the smallest of you will become a large nation . When the right time comes , I the Lord will quickly do this ! @" <EOS>
