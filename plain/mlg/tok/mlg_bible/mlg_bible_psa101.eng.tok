I will sing about loyalty and justice ! To you , O Lord , I will sing praises ! <EOS>
I will walk in the way of integrity . When will you come to me ? I will conduct my business with integrity in the midst of my palace . <EOS>
I will not even consider doing what is dishonest . I hate doing evil ; I will have no part of it . <EOS>
I will have nothing to do with a perverse person ; I will not permit evil . <EOS>
I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret . I will not tolerate anyone who has a cocky demeanor and an arrogant attitude . <EOS>
I will favor the honest people of the land , and allow them to live with me . Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me . <EOS>
Deceitful people will not live in my palace . Liars will not be welcome in my presence . <EOS>
Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land , and remove all evildoers from the city of the Lord . <EOS>
