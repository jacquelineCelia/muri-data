Listen to this message , you cows of Bashan who live on Mount Samaria ! You oppress the poor ; you crush the needy . You say to your husbands , "@ Bring us more to drink ! @" <EOS>
The sovereign Lord confirms this oath by his own holy character @: "@ Certainly the time is approaching when you will be carried away in baskets , every last one of you in fishermen 's pots . <EOS>
Each of you will go straight through the gaps in the walls ; you will be thrown out toward Harmon . @" The Lord is speaking ! Israel has an Appointment with God <EOS>
"@ Go to Bethel and rebel ! At Gilgal rebel some more ! Bring your sacrifices in the morning , your tithes on the third day ! <EOS>
Burn a thank offering of bread made with yeast ! Make a public display of your voluntary offerings ! For you love to do this , you Israelites . @" The sovereign Lord is speaking ! <EOS>
"@ But surely I gave you no food to eat in any of your cities ; you lacked food everywhere you live . Still you did not come back to me . @" The Lord is speaking ! <EOS>
"@ I withheld rain from you three months before the harvest . I gave rain to one city , but not to another . One field would get rain , but the field that received no rain dried up . <EOS>
People from two or three cities staggered into one city to get water , but remained thirsty . Still you did not come back to me . @" The Lord is speaking ! <EOS>
"@ I destroyed your crops with blight and disease . Locusts kept devouring your orchards , vineyards , fig trees , and olive trees . Still you did not come back to me . @" The Lord is speaking ! <EOS>
"@ I sent against you a plague like one of the Egyptian plagues . I killed your young men with the sword , along with the horses you had captured . I made the stench from the corpses rise up into your nostrils . Still you did not come back to me . @" The Lord is speaking ! <EOS>
"@ I overthrew some of you the way God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah . You were like a burning stick snatched from the flames . Still you did not come back to me . @" The Lord is speaking ! <EOS>
"@ Therefore this is what I will do to you , Israel . Because I will do this to you , prepare to meet your God , Israel ! <EOS>
For here he is ! He formed the mountains and created the wind . He reveals his plans to men . He turns the dawn into darkness and marches on the heights of the earth . The Lord , the God who commands armies , is his name ! @" <EOS>
