Now Dinah , Leah 's daughter whom she bore to Jacob , went to meet the young women of the land . <EOS>
When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite , who ruled that area , saw her , he grabbed her , forced himself on her , and sexually assaulted her . <EOS>
Then he became very attached to Dinah , Jacob 's daughter . He fell in love with the young woman and spoke romantically to her . <EOS>
Shechem said to his father Hamor , "@ Acquire this young girl as my wife . @" <EOS>
When Jacob heard that Shechem had violated his daughter Dinah , his sons were with the livestock in the field . So Jacob remained silent until they came in . <EOS>
Then Shechem 's father Hamor went to speak with Jacob about Dinah . <EOS>
Now Jacob 's sons had come in from the field when they heard the news . They were offended and very angry because Shechem had disgraced Israel by sexually assaulting Jacob 's daughter , a crime that should not be committed . <EOS>
But Hamor made this appeal to them @: "@ My son Shechem is in love with your daughter . Please give her to him as his wife . <EOS>
Intermarry with us . Let us marry your daughters , and take our daughters as wives for yourselves . <EOS>
You may live among us , and the land will be open to you . Live in it , travel freely in it , and acquire property in it . @" <EOS>
Then Shechem said to Dinah 's father and brothers , "@ Let me find favor in your sight , and whatever you require of me I 'll give . <EOS>
You can make the bride price and the gift I must bring very expensive , and I 'll give whatever you ask of me . Just give me the young woman as my wife ! @" <EOS>
Jacob 's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully when they spoke because Shechem had violated their sister Dinah . <EOS>
They said to them , "@ We can not give our sister to a man who is not circumcised , for it would be a disgrace to us . <EOS>
We will give you our consent on this one condition @: You must become like us by circumcising all your males . <EOS>
Then we will give you our daughters to marry , and we will take your daughters as wives for ourselves , and we will live among you and become one people . <EOS>
But if you do not agree to our terms by being circumcised , then we will take our sister and depart . @" <EOS>
Their offer pleased Hamor and his son Shechem . <EOS>
The young man did not delay in doing what they asked because he wanted Jacob 's daughter Dinah badly . ( Now he was more important than anyone in his father 's household . ) <EOS>
So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city , <EOS>
"@ These men are at peace with us . So let them live in the land and travel freely in it , for the land is wide enough for them . We will take their daughters for wives , and we will give them our daughters to marry . <EOS>
Only on this one condition will these men consent to live with us and become one people @: They demand that every male among us be circumcised just as they are circumcised . <EOS>
If we do so , will n't their livestock , their property , and all their animals become ours ? So let 's consent to their demand , so they will live among us . @" <EOS>
All the men who assembled at the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem . Every male who assembled at the city gate was circumcised . <EOS>
In three days , when they were still in pain , two of Jacob 's sons , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brothers , each took his sword and went to the unsuspecting city and slaughtered every male . <EOS>
They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword , took Dinah from Shechem 's house , and left . <EOS>
Jacob 's sons killed them and looted the city because their sister had been violated . <EOS>
They took their flocks , herds , and donkeys , as well as everything in the city and in the surrounding fields . <EOS>
They captured as plunder all their wealth , all their little ones , and their wives , including everything in the houses . <EOS>
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , "@ You have brought ruin on me by making me a foul odor among the inhabitants of the land - among the Canaanites and the Perizzites . I am few in number ; they will join forces against me and attack me , and both I and my family will be destroyed ! @" <EOS>
But Simeon and Levi replied , "@ Should he treat our sister like a common prostitute ? @" <EOS>
