I look up toward the hills . From where does my help come ? <EOS>
My help comes from the Lord , the Creator of heaven and earth ! <EOS>
May he not allow your foot to slip ! May your protector not sleep ! <EOS>
Look ! Israel 's protector does not sleep or slumber ! <EOS>
The Lord is your protector ; the Lord is the shade at your right hand . <EOS>
The sun will not harm you by day , or the moon by night . <EOS>
The Lord will protect you from all harm ; he will protect your life . <EOS>
The Lord will protect you in all you do , now and forevermore . <EOS>
