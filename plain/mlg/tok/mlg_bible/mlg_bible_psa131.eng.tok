O Lord , my heart is not proud , nor do I have a haughty look . I do not have great aspirations , or concern myself with things that are beyond me . <EOS>
Indeed I am composed and quiet , like a young child carried by its mother ; I am content like the young child I carry . <EOS>
O Israel , hope in the Lord now and forevermore ! <EOS>
