After this Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth . <EOS>
There he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome . Paul approached them , <EOS>
and because he worked at the same trade , he stayed with them and worked with them ( for they were tentmakers by trade ) . <EOS>
He addressed both Jews and Greeks in the synagogue every Sabbath , attempting to persuade them . <EOS>
Now when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul became wholly absorbed with proclaiming the word , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ . <EOS>
When they opposed him and reviled him , he protested by shaking out his clothes and said to them , "@ Your blood be on your own heads ! I am guiltless ! From now on I will go to the Gentiles ! @" <EOS>
Then Paul left the synagogue and went to the house of a person named Titius Justus , a Gentile who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue . <EOS>
Crispus , the president of the synagogue , believed in the Lord together with his entire household , and many of the Corinthians who heard about it believed and were baptized . <EOS>
The Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night , "@ Do not be afraid , but speak and do not be silent , <EOS>
because I am with you , and no one will assault you to harm you , because I have many people in this city . @" <EOS>
So he stayed there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them . Paul Before the Proconsul Gallio <EOS>
Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews attacked Paul together and brought him before the judgment seat , <EOS>
saying , "@ This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law ! @" <EOS>
But just as Paul was about to speak , Gallio said to the Jews , "@ If it were a matter of some crime or serious piece of villainy , I would have been justified in accepting the complaint of you Jews , <EOS>
but since it concerns points of disagreement about words and names and your own law , settle it yourselves . I will not be a judge of these things ! @" <EOS>
Then he had them forced away from the judgment seat . <EOS>
So they all seized Sosthenes , the president of the synagogue , and began to beat him in front of the judgment seat . Yet none of these things were of any concern to Gallio . Paul Returns to Antioch in Syria <EOS>
Paul , after staying many more days in Corinth , said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila . He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because he had made a vow . <EOS>
When they reached Ephesus , Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind there , but he himself went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews . <EOS>
When they asked him to stay longer , he would not consent , <EOS>
but said farewell to them and added , "@ I will come back to you again if God wills . @" Then he set sail from Ephesus , <EOS>
and when he arrived at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem and then went down to Antioch . <EOS>
After he spent some time there , Paul left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples . Apollos Begins His Ministry <EOS>
Now a Jew named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , arrived in Ephesus . He was an eloquent speaker , well @-@ versed in the scriptures . <EOS>
He had been instructed in the way of the Lord , and with great enthusiasm he spoke and taught accurately the facts about Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John . <EOS>
He began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue , but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately . <EOS>
When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia , the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . When he arrived , he assisted greatly those who had believed by grace , <EOS>
for he refuted the Jews vigorously in public debate , demonstrating from the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus . <EOS>
