Then the Lord spoke to Moses @: <EOS>
"@ Command the Israelites to expel from the camp every leper , everyone who has a discharge , and whoever becomes defiled by a corpse . <EOS>
You must expel both men and women ; you must put them outside the camp , so that they will not defile their camps , among which I live . @" <EOS>
So the Israelites did so , and expelled them outside the camp . As the Lord had spoken to Moses , so the Israelites did . Restitution for Sin <EOS>
Then the Lord spoke to Moses @: <EOS>
"@ Tell the Israelites , ‘ When a man or a woman commits any sin that people commit , thereby breaking faith with the Lord , and that person is found guilty , <EOS>
then he must confess his sin that he has committed and must make full reparation , add one fifth to it , and give it to whomever he wronged . <EOS>
But if the individual has no close relative to whom reparation can be made for the wrong , the reparation for the wrong must be paid to the Lord for the priest , in addition to the ram of atonement by which atonement is made for him . <EOS>
Every offering of all the Israelites ' holy things that they bring to the priest will be his . <EOS>
Every man 's holy things will be his ; whatever any man gives the priest will be his . ’ @" The Jealousy Ordeal <EOS>
The Lord spoke to Moses @: <EOS>
"@ Speak to the Israelites and tell them , ‘ If any man 's wife goes astray and behaves unfaithfully toward him , <EOS>
and a man has sexual relations with her without her husband knowing it , and it is hidden that she has defiled herself , since there was no witness against her , nor was she caught - <EOS>
and if jealous feelings come over him and he becomes suspicious of his wife , when she is defiled ; or if jealous feelings come over him and he becomes suspicious of his wife , when she is not defiled - <EOS>
then the man must bring his wife to the priest , and he must bring the offering required for her , one tenth of an ephah of barley meal ; he must not pour olive oil on it or put frankincense on it , because it is a grain offering of suspicion , a grain offering for remembering , for bringing iniquity to remembrance . <EOS>
"@ ‘ Then the priest will bring her near and have her stand before the Lord . <EOS>
The priest will then take holy water in a pottery jar , and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle , and put it into the water . <EOS>
Then the priest will have the woman stand before the Lord , uncover the woman 's head , and put the grain offering for remembering in her hands , which is the grain offering of suspicion . The priest will hold in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse . <EOS>
Then the priest will put the woman under oath and say to the her , "@ If no other man has had sexual relations with you , and if you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband 's authority , may you be free from this bitter water that brings a curse . <EOS>
But if you have gone astray while under your husband 's authority , and if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has had sexual relations with you … . @" <EOS>
Then the priest will put the woman under the oath of the curse and will say to the her , "@ The Lord make you an attested curse among your people , if the Lord makes your thigh fall away and your abdomen swell ; <EOS>
and this water that causes the curse will go into your stomach , and make your abdomen swell and your thigh rot . @" Then the woman must say , "@ Amen , amen . @" <EOS>
"@ ‘ Then the priest will write these curses on a scroll and then scrape them off into the bitter water . <EOS>
He will make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse , and the water that brings a curse will enter her to produce bitterness . <EOS>
The priest will take the grain offering of suspicion from the woman 's hand , wave the grain offering before the Lord , and bring it to the altar . <EOS>
Then the priest will take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial portion , burn it on the altar , and afterward make the woman drink the water . <EOS>
When he has made her drink the water , then , if she has defiled herself and behaved unfaithfully toward her husband , the water that brings a curse will enter her to produce bitterness - her abdomen will swell , her thigh will fall away , and the woman will become a curse among her people . <EOS>
But if the woman has not defiled herself , and is clean , then she will be free of ill effects and will be able to bear children . <EOS>
"@ ‘ This is the law for cases of jealousy , when a wife , while under her husband 's authority , goes astray and defiles herself , <EOS>
or when jealous feelings come over a man and he becomes suspicious of his wife ; then he must have the woman stand before the Lord , and the priest will carry out all this law upon her . <EOS>
Then the man will be free from iniquity , but that woman will bear the consequences of her iniquity . ’ @" <EOS>
