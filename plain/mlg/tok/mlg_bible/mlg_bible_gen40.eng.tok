After these things happened , the cupbearer to the king of Egypt and the royal baker offended their master , the king of Egypt . <EOS>
Pharaoh was enraged with his two officials , the cupbearer and the baker , <EOS>
so he imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard in the same facility where Joseph was confined . <EOS>
The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be their attendant , and he served them . They spent some time in custody . <EOS>
Both of them , the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt , who were confined in the prison , had a dream the same night . Each man 's dream had its own meaning . <EOS>
When Joseph came to them in the morning , he saw that they were looking depressed . <EOS>
So he asked Pharaoh 's officials , who were with him in custody in his master 's house , "@ Why do you look so sad today ? @" <EOS>
They told him , "@ We both had dreams , but there is no one to interpret them . @" Joseph responded , "@ Do n't interpretations belong to God ? Tell them to me . @" <EOS>
So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph @: "@ In my dream , there was a vine in front of me . <EOS>
On the vine there were three branches . As it budded , its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes . <EOS>
Now Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand , so I took the grapes , squeezed them into his cup , and put the cup in Pharaoh 's hand . @" <EOS>
"@ This is its meaning , " Joseph said to him . "@ The three branches represent three days . <EOS>
In three more days Pharaoh will reinstate you and restore you to your office . You will put Pharaoh 's cup in his hand , just as you did before when you were cupbearer . <EOS>
But remember me when it goes well for you , and show me kindness . Make mention of me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this prison , <EOS>
for I really was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and I have done nothing wrong here for which they should put me in a dungeon . @" <EOS>
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation of the first dream was favorable , he said to Joseph , "@ I also appeared in my dream and there were three baskets of white bread on my head . <EOS>
In the top basket there were baked goods of every kind for Pharaoh , but the birds were eating them from the basket that was on my head . @" <EOS>
Joseph replied , "@ This is its meaning @: The three baskets represent three days . <EOS>
In three more days Pharaoh will decapitate you and impale you on a pole . Then the birds will eat your flesh from you . @" <EOS>
On the third day it was Pharaoh 's birthday , so he gave a feast for all his servants . He "@ lifted up @" the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants . <EOS>
He restored the chief cupbearer to his former position so that he placed the cup in Pharaoh 's hand , <EOS>
but the chief baker he impaled , just as Joseph had predicted . <EOS>
But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph - he forgot him . <EOS>
