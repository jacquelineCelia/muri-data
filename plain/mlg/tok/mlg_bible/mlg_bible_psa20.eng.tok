May the Lord answer you when you are in trouble ; may the God of Jacob make you secure ! <EOS>
May he send you help from his temple ; from Zion may he give you support ! <EOS>
May he take notice of your offerings ; may he accept your burnt sacrifice ! ( Selah ) <EOS>
May he grant your heart 's desire ; may he bring all your plans to pass ! <EOS>
Then we will shout for joy over your victory ; we will rejoice in the name of our God ! May the Lord grant all your requests ! <EOS>
Now I am sure that the Lord will deliver his chosen king ; he will intervene for him from his holy heavenly temple , and display his mighty ability to deliver . <EOS>
Some trust in chariots and others in horses , but we depend on the Lord our God . <EOS>
They will fall down , but we will stand firm . <EOS>
The Lord will deliver the king ; he will answer us when we call to him for help ! <EOS>
