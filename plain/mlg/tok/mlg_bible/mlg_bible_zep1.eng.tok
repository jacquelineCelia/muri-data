This is the prophetic message that the Lord gave to Zephaniah son of Cushi , son of Gedaliah , son of Amariah , son of Hezekiah . Zephaniah delivered this message during the reign of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah @: The Lord 's Day of Judgment is Approaching <EOS>
"@ I will destroy everything from the face of the earth , " says the Lord . <EOS>
"@ I will destroy people and animals ; I will destroy the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea . ( The idolatrous images of these creatures will be destroyed along with evil people . ) I will remove humanity from the face of the earth , " says the Lord . <EOS>
"@ I will attack Judah and all who live in Jerusalem . I will remove from this place every trace of Baal worship , as well as the very memory of the pagan priests . <EOS>
I will remove those who worship the stars in the sky from their rooftops , those who swear allegiance to the Lord while taking oaths in the name of their ‘ king , ’ <EOS>
and those who turn their backs on the Lord and do not want the Lord 's help or guidance . @" <EOS>
Be silent before the Lord God , for the Lord 's day of judgment is almost here . The Lord has prepared a sacrificial meal ; he has ritually purified his guests . <EOS>
"@ On the day of the Lord 's sacrificial meal , I will punish the princes and the king 's sons , and all who wear foreign styles of clothing . <EOS>
On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold , who fill the house of their master with wealth taken by violence and deceit . <EOS>
On that day , " says the Lord , "@ a loud cry will go up from the Fish Gate , wailing from the city 's newer district , and a loud crash from the hills . <EOS>
Wail , you who live in the market district , for all the merchants will disappear and those who count money will be removed . <EOS>
At that time I will search through Jerusalem with lamps . I will punish the people who are entrenched in their sin , those who think to themselves , ‘ The Lord neither rewards nor punishes . ’ <EOS>
Their wealth will be stolen and their houses ruined ! They will not live in the houses they have built , nor will they drink the wine from the vineyards they have planted . <EOS>
The Lord 's great day of judgment is almost here ; it is approaching very rapidly ! There will be a bitter sound on the Lord 's day of judgment ; at that time warriors will cry out in battle . <EOS>
That day will be a day of God 's anger , a day of distress and hardship , a day of devastation and ruin , a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and dark skies , <EOS>
a day of trumpet blasts and battle cries . Judgment will fall on the fortified cities and the high corner towers . <EOS>
I will bring distress on the people and they will stumble like blind men , for they have sinned against the Lord . Their blood will be poured out like dirt ; their flesh will be scattered like manure . <EOS>
Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord 's angry judgment . The whole earth will be consumed by his fiery wrath . Indeed , he will bring terrifying destruction on all who live on the earth . @" <EOS>
