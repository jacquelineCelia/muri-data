I look up toward you , the one enthroned in heaven . <EOS>
Look , as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master , as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress , so my eyes will look to the Lord , our God , until he shows us favor . <EOS>
Show us favor , O Lord , show us favor ! For we have had our fill of humiliation , and then some . <EOS>
We have had our fill of the taunts of the self @-@ assured , of the contempt of the proud . <EOS>
