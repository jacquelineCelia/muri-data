Fools say to themselves , "@ There is no God . @" They sin and commit evil deeds ; none of them does what is right . <EOS>
God looks down from heaven at the human race , to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God . <EOS>
Everyone rejects God ; they are all morally corrupt . None of them does what is right , not even one ! <EOS>
All those who behave wickedly do not understand - those who devour my people as if they were eating bread , and do not call out to God . <EOS>
They are absolutely terrified , even by things that do not normally cause fear . For God annihilates those who attack you . You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them . <EOS>
I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion ! When God restores the well @-@ being of his people , may Jacob rejoice , may Israel be happy ! <EOS>
