Lord , how numerous are my enemies ! Many attack me . <EOS>
Many say about me , "@ God will not deliver him . @" ( Selah ) <EOS>
But you , Lord , are a shield that protects me ; you are my glory and the one who restores me . <EOS>
To the Lord I cried out , and he answered me from his holy hill . ( Selah ) <EOS>
I rested and slept ; I awoke , for the Lord protects me . <EOS>
I am not afraid of the multitude of people who attack me from all directions . <EOS>
Rise up , Lord ! Deliver me , my God ! Yes , you will strike all my enemies on the jaw ; you will break the teeth of the wicked . <EOS>
The Lord delivers ; you show favor to your people . ( Selah ) <EOS>
