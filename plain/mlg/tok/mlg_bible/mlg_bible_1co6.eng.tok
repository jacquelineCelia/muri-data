When any of you has a legal dispute with another , does he dare go to court before the unrighteous rather than before the saints ? <EOS>
Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you not competent to settle trivial suits ? <EOS>
Do you not know that we will judge angels ? Why not ordinary matters ! <EOS>
So if you have ordinary lawsuits , do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church ? <EOS>
I say this to your shame ! Is there no one among you wise enough to settle disputes between fellow Christians ? <EOS>
Instead , does a Christian sue a Christian , and do this before unbelievers ? <EOS>
The fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves demonstrates that you have already been defeated . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ? <EOS>
But you yourselves wrong and cheat , and you do this to your brothers and sisters ! <EOS>
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ! The sexually immoral , idolaters , adulterers , passive homosexual partners , practicing homosexuals , <EOS>
thieves , the greedy , drunkards , the verbally abusive , and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God . <EOS>
Some of you once lived this way . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God . Flee Sexual Immorality <EOS>
"@ All things are lawful for me @" - but not everything is beneficial . "@ All things are lawful for me @" - but I will not be controlled by anything . <EOS>
"@ Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food , but God will do away with both . @" The body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body . <EOS>
Now God indeed raised the Lord and he will raise us by his power . <EOS>
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? Never ! <EOS>
Or do you not know that anyone who is united with a prostitute is one body with her ? For it is said , " The two will become one flesh . @" <EOS>
But the one united with the Lord is one spirit with him . <EOS>
Flee sexual immorality ! "@ Every sin a person commits is outside of the body @" - but the immoral person sins against his own body . <EOS>
Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you , whom you have from God , and you are not your own ? <EOS>
For you were bought at a price . Therefore glorify God with your body . <EOS>
