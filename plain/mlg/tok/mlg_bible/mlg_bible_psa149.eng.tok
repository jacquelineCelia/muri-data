Praise the Lord ! Sing to the Lord a new song ! Praise him in the assembly of the godly ! <EOS>
Let Israel rejoice in their Creator ! Let the people of Zion delight in their king ! <EOS>
Let them praise his name with dancing ! Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp ! <EOS>
For the Lord takes delight in his people ; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them . <EOS>
Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication ! Let them shout for joy upon their beds ! <EOS>
May they praise God while they hold a two @-@ edged sword in their hand , <EOS>
in order to take revenge on the nations , and punish foreigners . <EOS>
They bind their kings in chains , and their nobles in iron shackles , <EOS>
and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced . All his loyal followers will be vindicated . Praise the Lord ! <EOS>
