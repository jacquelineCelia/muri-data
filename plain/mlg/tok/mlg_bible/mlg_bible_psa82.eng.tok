God stands in the assembly of El ; in the midst of the gods he renders judgment . <EOS>
He says , "@ How long will you make unjust legal decisions and show favoritism to the wicked ? ( Selah ) <EOS>
Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless ! Vindicate the oppressed and suffering ! <EOS>
Rescue the poor and needy ! Deliver them from the power of the wicked ! <EOS>
They neither know nor understand . They stumble around in the dark , while all the foundations of the earth crumble . <EOS>
I thought , ‘ You are gods ; all of you are sons of the Most High . ’ <EOS>
Yet you will die like mortals ; you will fall like all the other rulers . @" <EOS>
Rise up , O God , and execute judgment on the earth ! For you own all the nations . <EOS>
