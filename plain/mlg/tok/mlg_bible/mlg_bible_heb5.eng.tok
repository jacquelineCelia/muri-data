For every high priest is taken from among the people and appointed to represent them before God , to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins . <EOS>
He is able to deal compassionately with those who are ignorant and erring , since he also is subject to weakness , <EOS>
and for this reason he is obligated to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people . <EOS>
And no one assumes this honor on his own initiative , but only when called to it by God , as in fact Aaron was . <EOS>
So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high priest , but the one who glorified him was God , who said to him , " You are my Son ! Today I have fathered you , @" <EOS>
as also in another place God says , " You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . @" <EOS>
During his earthly life Christ offered both requests and supplications , with loud cries and tears , to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his devotion . <EOS>
Although he was a son , he learned obedience through the things he suffered . <EOS>
And by being perfected in this way , he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him , <EOS>
and he was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek . The Need to Move on to Maturity <EOS>
On this topic we have much to say and it is difficult to explain , since you have become sluggish in hearing . <EOS>
For though you should in fact be teachers by this time , you need someone to teach you the beginning elements of God 's utterances . You have gone back to needing milk , not solid food . <EOS>
For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness , because he is an infant . <EOS>
But solid food is for the mature , whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both good and evil . <EOS>
