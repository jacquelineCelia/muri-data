I will give you thanks with all my heart ; before the heavenly assembly I will sing praises to you . <EOS>
I will bow down toward your holy temple , and give thanks to your name , because of your loyal love and faithfulness , for you have exalted your promise above the entire sky . <EOS>
When I cried out for help , you answered me . You made me bold and energized me . <EOS>
Let all the kings of the earth give thanks to you , O Lord , when they hear the words you speak . <EOS>
Let them sing about the Lord 's deeds , for the Lord 's splendor is magnificent . <EOS>
Though the Lord is exalted , he takes note of the lowly , and recognizes the proud from far away . <EOS>
Even when I must walk in the midst of danger , you revive me . You oppose my angry enemies , and your right hand delivers me . <EOS>
The Lord avenges me . O Lord , your loyal love endures . Do not abandon those whom you have made ! <EOS>
