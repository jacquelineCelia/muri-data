"@ Since my youth they have often attacked me , " let Israel say . <EOS>
"@ Since my youth they have often attacked me , but they have not defeated me . <EOS>
The plowers plowed my back ; they made their furrows long . <EOS>
The Lord is just ; he cut the ropes of the wicked . @" <EOS>
May all who hate Zion be humiliated and turned back ! <EOS>
May they be like the grass on the rooftops which withers before one can even pull it up , <EOS>
which can not fill the reaper 's hand , or the lap of the one who gathers the grain ! <EOS>
Those who pass by will not say , "@ May you experience the Lord 's blessing ! We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the Lord . @" <EOS>
