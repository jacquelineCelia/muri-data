At that same time the Lord said to me , "@ Carve out for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones and come up the mountain to me ; also make for yourself a wooden ark . <EOS>
I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets you broke , and you must put them into the ark . @" <EOS>
So I made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two stone tablets just like the first ones . Then I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands . <EOS>
The Lord then wrote on the tablets the same words , the ten commandments , which he had spoken to you at the mountain from the middle of the fire at the time of that assembly , and he gave them to me . <EOS>
Then I turned , went down the mountain , and placed the tablets into the ark I had made - they are still there , just as the Lord commanded me . Conclusion of the Historical Resume <EOS>
"@ During those days the Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene @-@ Yaaqan to Moserah . There Aaron died and was buried , and his son Eleazar became priest in his place . <EOS>
From there they traveled to Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a place of flowing streams . <EOS>
At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the Lord 's covenant , to stand before the Lord to serve him , and to formulate blessings in his name , as they do to this very day . <EOS>
Therefore Levi has no allotment or inheritance among his brothers ; the Lord is his inheritance just as the Lord your God told him . <EOS>
As for me , I stayed at the mountain as I did the first time , forty days and nights . The Lord listened to me that time as well and decided not to destroy you . <EOS>
Then he said to me , "@ Get up , set out leading the people so they may go and possess the land I promised to give to their ancestors . @" An Exhortation to Love Both God and People <EOS>
Now , Israel , what does the Lord your God require of you except to revere him , to obey all his commandments , to love him , to serve him with all your mind and being , <EOS>
and to keep the Lord 's commandments and statutes that I am giving you today for your own good ? <EOS>
The heavens - indeed the highest heavens - belong to the Lord your God , as does the earth and everything in it . <EOS>
However , only to your ancestors did he show his loving favor , and he chose you , their descendants , from all peoples - as is apparent today . <EOS>
Therefore , cleanse your heart and stop being so stubborn ! <EOS>
For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords , the great , mighty , and awesome God who is unbiased and takes no bribe , <EOS>
who justly treats the orphan and widow , and who loves resident foreigners , giving them food and clothing . <EOS>
So you must love the resident foreigner because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt . <EOS>
Revere the Lord your God , serve him , be loyal to him and take oaths only in his name . <EOS>
He is the one you should praise ; he is your God , the one who has done these great and awesome things for you that you have seen . <EOS>
When your ancestors went down to Egypt , they numbered only seventy , but now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky . <EOS>
