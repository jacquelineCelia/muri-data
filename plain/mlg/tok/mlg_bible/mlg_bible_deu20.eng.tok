When you go to war against your enemies and see chariotry and troops who outnumber you , do not be afraid of them , for the Lord your God , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt , is with you . <EOS>
As you move forward for battle , the priest will approach and say to the soldiers , <EOS>
"@ Listen , Israel ! Today you are moving forward to do battle with your enemies . Do not be fainthearted . Do not fear and tremble or be terrified because of them , <EOS>
for the Lord your God goes with you to fight on your behalf against your enemies to give you victory . @" <EOS>
Moreover , the officers are to say to the troops , "@ Who among you has built a new house and not dedicated it ? He may go home , lest he die in battle and someone else dedicate it . <EOS>
Or who among you has planted a vineyard and not benefited from it ? He may go home , lest he die in battle and someone else benefit from it . <EOS>
Or who among you has become engaged to a woman but has not married her ? He may go home , lest he die in battle and someone else marry her . @" <EOS>
In addition , the officers are to say to the troops , "@ Who among you is afraid and fainthearted ? He may go home so that he will not make his fellow soldier 's heart as fearful as his own . @" <EOS>
Then , when the officers have finished speaking , they must appoint unit commanders to lead the troops . <EOS>
When you approach a city to wage war against it , offer it terms of peace . <EOS>
If it accepts your terms and submits to you , all the people found in it will become your slaves . <EOS>
If it does not accept terms of peace but makes war with you , then you are to lay siege to it . <EOS>
The Lord your God will deliver it over to you and you must kill every single male by the sword . <EOS>
However , the women , little children , cattle , and anything else in the city - all its plunder - you may take for yourselves as spoil . You may take from your enemies the plunder that the Lord your God has given you . <EOS>
This is how you are to deal with all those cities located far from you , those that do not belong to these nearby nations . Laws Concerning War with Canaanite Nations <EOS>
As for the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God is going to give you as an inheritance , you must not allow a single living thing to survive . <EOS>
Instead you must utterly annihilate them - the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites - just as the Lord your God has commanded you , <EOS>
so that they can not teach you all the abhorrent ways they worship their gods , causing you to sin against the Lord your God . <EOS>
If you besiege a city for a long time while attempting to capture it , you must not chop down its trees , for you may eat fruit from them and should not cut them down . A tree in the field is not human that you should besiege it ! <EOS>
However , you may chop down any tree you know is not suitable for food , and you may use it to build siege works against the city that is making war with you until that city falls . <EOS>
