Praise the Lord ! Praise , you servants of the Lord , praise the name of the Lord ! <EOS>
May the Lord 's name be praised now and forevermore ! <EOS>
From east to west the Lord 's name is deserving of praise . <EOS>
The Lord is exalted over all the nations ; his splendor reaches beyond the sky . <EOS>
Who can compare to the Lord our God , who sits on a high throne ? <EOS>
He bends down to look at the sky and the earth . <EOS>
He raises the poor from the dirt , and lifts up the needy from the garbage pile , <EOS>
that he might seat him with princes , with the princes of his people . <EOS>
He makes the barren woman of the family a happy mother of children . Praise the Lord ! <EOS>
