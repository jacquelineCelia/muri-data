This is what the Lord says to his chosen one , to Cyrus , whose right hand I hold in order to subdue nations before him , and disarm kings , to open doors before him , so gates remain unclosed @: <EOS>
"@ I will go before you and level mountains . Bronze doors I will shatter and iron bars I will hack through . <EOS>
I will give you hidden treasures , riches stashed away in secret places , so you may recognize that I am the Lord , the one who calls you by name , the God of Israel . <EOS>
For the sake of my servant Jacob , Israel , my chosen one , I call you by name and give you a title of respect , even though you do not recognize me . <EOS>
I am the Lord , I have no peer , there is no God but me . I arm you for battle , even though you do not recognize me . <EOS>
I do this so people will recognize from east to west that there is no God but me ; I am the Lord , I have no peer . <EOS>
I am the one who forms light and creates darkness ; the one who brings about peace and creates calamity . I am the Lord , who accomplishes all these things . <EOS>
O sky , rain down from above ! Let the clouds send down showers of deliverance ! Let the earth absorb it so salvation may grow , and deliverance may sprout up along with it . I , the Lord , create it . The Lord Gives a Warning <EOS>
One who argues with his creator is in grave danger , one who is like a mere shard among the other shards on the ground ! The clay should not say to the potter , "@ What in the world are you doing ? Your work lacks skill ! @" <EOS>
Danger awaits one who says to his father , "@ What in the world are you fathering ? @" and to his mother , "@ What in the world are you bringing forth ? @" <EOS>
This is what the Lord says , the Holy One of Israel , the one who formed him , concerning things to come @: "@ How dare you question me about my children ! How dare you tell me what to do with the work of my own hands ! <EOS>
I made the earth , I created the people who live on it . It was me - my hands stretched out the sky , I give orders to all the heavenly lights . <EOS>
It is me - I stir him up and commission him ; I will make all his ways level . He will rebuild my city ; he will send my exiled people home , but not for a price or a bribe , " says the Lord who commands armies . The Lord is the Nations ' Only Hope <EOS>
This is what the Lord says @: "@ The profit of Egypt and the revenue of Ethiopia , along with the Sabeans , those tall men , will be brought to you and become yours . They will walk behind you , coming along in chains . They will bow down to you and pray to you @: ‘ Truly God is with you ; he has no peer ; there is no other God ! ’ @" <EOS>
Yes , you are a God who keeps hidden , O God of Israel , deliverer ! <EOS>
They will all be ashamed and embarrassed ; those who fashion idols will all be humiliated . <EOS>
Israel will be delivered once and for all by the Lord ; you will never again be ashamed or humiliated . <EOS>
For this is what the Lord says , the one who created the sky - he is the true God , the one who formed the earth and made it ; he established it , he did not create it without order , he formed it to be inhabited - "@ I am the Lord , I have no peer . <EOS>
I have not spoken in secret , in some hidden place . I did not tell Jacob 's descendants , ‘ Seek me in vain ! ’ I am the Lord , the one who speaks honestly , who makes reliable announcements . <EOS>
Gather together and come ! Approach together , you refugees from the nations ! Those who carry wooden idols know nothing , those who pray to a god that can not deliver . <EOS>
Tell me ! Present the evidence ! Let them consult with one another ! Who predicted this in the past ? Who announced it beforehand ? Was it not I , the Lord ? I have no peer , there is no God but me , a God who vindicates and delivers ; there is none but me . <EOS>
Turn to me so you can be delivered , all you who live in the earth 's remote regions ! For I am God , and I have no peer . <EOS>
I solemnly make this oath - what I say is true and reliable @: ‘ Surely every knee will bow to me , every tongue will solemnly affirm ; <EOS>
they will say about me , "@ Yes , the Lord is a powerful deliverer . @"@ ' @" All who are angry at him will cower before him . <EOS>
All the descendants of Israel will be vindicated by the Lord and will boast in him . <EOS>
