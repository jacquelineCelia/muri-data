This is the word of the Lord which was revealed to Hosea son of Beeri during the time when Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah ruled Judah , and during the time when Jeroboam son of Joash ruled Israel . Symbols of Sin and Judgment @: The Prostitute and Her Children <EOS>
When the Lord first spoke through Hosea , he said to him , "@ Go marry a prostitute who will bear illegitimate children conceived through prostitution , because the nation continually commits spiritual prostitution by turning away from the Lord . @" <EOS>
So Hosea married Gomer , the daughter of Diblaim . Then she conceived and gave birth to a son for him . <EOS>
Then the Lord said to Hosea , "@ Name him ‘ Jezreel , ’ because in a little while I will punish the dynasty of Jehu on account of the bloodshed in the valley of Jezreel , and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel . <EOS>
At that time , I will destroy the military power of Israel in the valley of Jezreel . @" <EOS>
She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter . Then the Lord said to him , "@ Name her ‘ No Pity ’ ( Lo @-@ Ruhamah ) because I will no longer have pity on the nation of Israel . For I will certainly not forgive their guilt . <EOS>
But I will have pity on the nation of Judah . I will deliver them by the Lord their God ; I will not deliver them by the warrior 's bow , by sword , by military victory , by chariot horses , or by chariots . @" <EOS>
When she had weaned ‘ No Pity ’ ( Lo @-@ Ruhamah ) she conceived again and gave birth to another son . <EOS>
Then the Lord said @: "@ Name him ‘ Not My People ’ ( Lo @-@ Ammi ) , because you are not my people and I am not your God . @" <EOS>
