In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus , who was of Median descent and who had been appointed king over the Babylonian empire - <EOS>
in the first year of his reign I , Daniel , came to understand from the sacred books that , according to the word of the LORD disclosed to the prophet Jeremiah , the years for the fulfilling of the desolation of Jerusalem were seventy in number . <EOS>
So I turned my attention to the Lord God to implore him by prayer and requests , with fasting , sackcloth , and ashes . <EOS>
I prayed to the LORD my God , confessing in this way @: "@ O Lord , great and awesome God who is faithful to his covenant with those who love him and keep his commandments , <EOS>
we have sinned ! We have done what is wrong and wicked ; we have rebelled by turning away from your commandments and standards . <EOS>
We have not paid attention to your servants the prophets , who spoke by your authority to our kings , our leaders , and our ancestors , and to all the inhabitants of the land as well . <EOS>
"@ You are righteous , O Lord , but we are humiliated this day - the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel , both near and far away in all the countries in which you have scattered them , because they have behaved unfaithfully toward you . <EOS>
O LORD , we have been humiliated - our kings , our leaders , and our ancestors - because we have sinned against you . <EOS>
Yet the Lord our God is compassionate and forgiving , even though we have rebelled against him . <EOS>
We have not obeyed the LORD our God by living according to his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets . <EOS>
"@ All Israel has broken your law and turned away by not obeying you . Therefore you have poured out on us the judgment solemnly threatened in the law of Moses the servant of God , for we have sinned against you . <EOS>
He has carried out his threats against us and our rulers who were over us by bringing great calamity on us - what has happened to Jerusalem has never been equaled under all heaven ! <EOS>
Just as it is written in the law of Moses , so all this calamity has come on us . Still we have not tried to pacify the LORD our God by turning back from our sin and by seeking wisdom from your reliable moral standards . <EOS>
The LORD was mindful of the calamity , and he brought it on us . For the LORD our God is just in all he has done , and we have not obeyed him . <EOS>
"@ Now , O Lord our God , who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with great power and made a name for yourself that is remembered to this day - we have sinned and behaved wickedly . <EOS>
O Lord , according to all your justice , please turn your raging anger away from your city Jerusalem , your holy mountain . For due to our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors , Jerusalem and your people are mocked by all our neighbors . <EOS>
"@ So now , our God , accept the prayer and requests of your servant , and show favor to your devastated sanctuary for your own sake . <EOS>
Listen attentively , my God , and hear ! Open your eyes and look on our desolated ruins and the city called by your name . For it is not because of our own righteous deeds that we are praying to you , but because your compassion is abundant . <EOS>
O Lord , hear ! O Lord , forgive ! O Lord , pay attention , and act ! Do n't delay , for your own sake , O my God ! For your city and your people are called by your name . @" Gabriel Gives to Daniel a Prophecy of Seventy Weeks <EOS>
While I was still speaking and praying , confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my request before the LORD my God concerning his holy mountain - <EOS>
yes , while I was still praying , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen previously in a vision , was approaching me in my state of extreme weariness , around the time of the evening offering . <EOS>
He spoke with me , instructing me as follows @: "@ Daniel , I have now come to impart understanding to you . <EOS>
At the beginning of your requests a message went out , and I have come to convey it to you , for you are of great value in God 's sight . Therefore consider the message and understand the vision @: <EOS>
"@ Seventy weeks have been determined concerning your people and your holy city to put an end to rebellion , to bring sin to completion , to atone for iniquity , to bring in perpetual righteousness , to seal up the prophetic vision , and to anoint a most holy place . <EOS>
So know and understand @: From the issuing of the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until an anointed one , a prince arrives , there will be a period of seven weeks and sixty @-@ two weeks . It will again be built , with plaza and moat , but in distressful times . <EOS>
Now after the sixty @-@ two weeks , an anointed one will be cut off and have nothing . As for the city and the sanctuary , the people of the coming prince will destroy them . But his end will come speedily like a flood . Until the end of the war that has been decreed there will be destruction . <EOS>
He will confirm a covenant with many for one week . But in the middle of that week he will bring sacrifices and offerings to a halt . On the wing of abominations will come one who destroys , until the decreed end is poured out on the one who destroys . @" <EOS>
