To the Lord I cry out ; to the Lord I plead for mercy . <EOS>
I pour out my lament before him ; I tell him about my troubles . <EOS>
Even when my strength leaves me , you watch my footsteps . In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me . <EOS>
Look to the right and see ! No one cares about me . I have nowhere to run ; no one is concerned about my life . <EOS>
I cry out to you , O Lord ; I say , "@ You are my shelter , my security in the land of the living . @" <EOS>
Listen to my cry for help , for I am in serious trouble ! Rescue me from those who chase me , for they are stronger than I am . <EOS>
Free me from prison , that I may give thanks to your name . Because of me the godly will assemble , for you will vindicate me . <EOS>
