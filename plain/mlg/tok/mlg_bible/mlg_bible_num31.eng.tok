The Lord spoke to Moses @: <EOS>
"@ Exact vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites - after that you will be gathered to your people . @" <EOS>
So Moses spoke to the people @: "@ Arm men from among you for the war , to attack the Midianites and to execute the Lord 's vengeance on Midian . <EOS>
You must send to the battle a thousand men from every tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel . @" <EOS>
So a thousand from every tribe , twelve thousand armed for battle in all , were provided out of the thousands of Israel . Campaign Against the Midianites <EOS>
So Moses sent them to the war , one thousand from every tribe , with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest , who was in charge of the holy articles and the signal trumpets . <EOS>
They fought against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses , and they killed every male . <EOS>
They killed the kings of Midian in addition to those slain - Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur , and Reba - five Midianite kings . They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword . <EOS>
The Israelites took the women of Midian captives along with their little ones , and took all their herds , all their flocks , and all their goods as plunder . <EOS>
They burned all their towns where they lived and all their encampments . <EOS>
They took all the plunder and all the spoils , both people and animals . <EOS>
They brought the captives and the spoils and the plunder to Moses , to Eleazar the priest , and to the Israelite community , to the camp on the plains of Moab , along the Jordan River across from Jericho . <EOS>
Moses , Eleazar the priest , and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp . The Death of the Midianite Women <EOS>
But Moses was furious with the officers of the army , the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds , who had come from service in the war . <EOS>
Moses said to them , "@ Have you allowed all the women to live ? <EOS>
Look , these people through the counsel of Balaam caused the Israelites to act treacherously against the Lord in the matter of Peor - which resulted in the plague among the community of the Lord ! <EOS>
Now therefore kill every boy , and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man . <EOS>
But all the young women who have not had sexual intercourse with a man will be yours . Purification After Battle <EOS>
"@ Any of you who has killed anyone or touched any of the dead , remain outside the camp for seven days ; purify yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day . <EOS>
You must purify each garment and everything that is made of skin , everything made of goat 's hair , and everything made of wood . @" <EOS>
Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone into the battle , "@ This is the ordinance of the law that the Lord commanded Moses @: <EOS>
‘ Only the gold , the silver , the bronze , the iron , the tin , and the lead , <EOS>
everything that may stand the fire , you are to pass through the fire , and it will be ceremonially clean , but it must still be purified with the water of purification . Anything that can not withstand the fire you must pass through the water . <EOS>
You must wash your clothes on the seventh day , and you will be ceremonially clean , and afterward you may enter the camp . ’ @" The Distribution of Spoils <EOS>
Then the Lord spoke to Moses @: <EOS>
"@ You and Eleazar the priest , and all the family leaders of the community , take the sum of the plunder that was captured , both people and animals . <EOS>
Divide the plunder into two parts , one for those who took part in the war - who went out to battle - and the other for all the community . <EOS>
"@ You must exact a tribute for the Lord from the fighting men who went out to battle @: one life out of five hundred , from the people , the cattle , and from the donkeys and the sheep . <EOS>
You are to take it from their half @-@ share and give it to Eleazar the priest for a raised offering to the Lord . <EOS>
From the Israelites ' half @-@ share you are to take one portion out of fifty of the people , the cattle , the donkeys , and the sheep - from every kind of animal - and you are to give them to the Levites , who are responsible for the care of the Lord 's tabernacle . @" <EOS>
So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses . <EOS>
The spoil that remained of the plunder which the fighting men had gathered was 675,000 sheep , <EOS>
72,000 cattle , <EOS>
61,000 donkeys , <EOS>
and 32,000 young women who had never had sexual intercourse with a man . <EOS>
The half @-@ portion of those who went to war numbered 337,500 sheep ; <EOS>
the Lord 's tribute from the sheep was 675 . <EOS>
The cattle numbered 36,000 ; the Lord 's tribute was 72 . <EOS>
The donkeys were 30,500 , of which the Lord 's tribute was 61 . <EOS>
The people were 16,000 , of which the Lord 's tribute was 32 people . <EOS>
So Moses gave the tribute , which was the Lord 's raised offering , to Eleazar the priest , as the Lord commanded Moses . <EOS>
From the Israelites ' half @-@ share that Moses had separated from the fighting men , <EOS>
there were 337,500 sheep from the portion belonging to the community , <EOS>
36,000 cattle , <EOS>
30,500 donkeys , <EOS>
and 16,000 people . <EOS>
From the Israelites ' share Moses took one of every fifty people and animals and gave them to the Levites who were responsible for the care of the Lord 's tabernacle , just as the Lord commanded Moses . <EOS>
Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the commanders over thousands and the commanders over hundreds , approached Moses <EOS>
and said to him , "@ Your servants have taken a count of the men who were in the battle , who were under our authority , and not one is missing . <EOS>
So we have brought as an offering for the Lord what each man found @: gold ornaments , armlets , bracelets , signet rings , earrings , and necklaces , to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord . @" <EOS>
Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them , all of it in the form of ornaments . <EOS>
All the gold of the offering they offered up to the Lord from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds weighed 16,750 shekels . <EOS>
Each soldier had taken plunder for himself . <EOS>
So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord . <EOS>
