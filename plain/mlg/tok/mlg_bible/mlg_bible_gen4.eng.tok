Now the man had marital relations with his wife Eve , and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain . Then she said , "@ I have created a man just as the Lord did ! @" <EOS>
Then she gave birth to his brother Abel . Abel took care of the flocks , while Cain cultivated the ground . <EOS>
At the designated time Cain brought some of the fruit of the ground for an offering to the Lord . <EOS>
But Abel brought some of the firstborn of his flock - even the fattest of them . And the Lord was pleased with Abel and his offering , <EOS>
but with Cain and his offering he was not pleased . So Cain became very angry , and his expression was downcast . <EOS>
Then the Lord said to Cain , "@ Why are you angry , and why is your expression downcast ? <EOS>
Is it not true that if you do what is right , you will be fine ? But if you do not do what is right , sin is crouching at the door . It desires to dominate you , but you must subdue it . @" <EOS>
Cain said to his brother Abel , "@ Let 's go out to the field . @" While they were in the field , Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him . <EOS>
Then the Lord said to Cain , "@ Where is your brother Abel ? @" And he replied , "@ I do n't know ! Am I my brother 's guardian ? @" <EOS>
But the Lord said , "@ What have you done ? The voice of your brother 's blood is crying out to me from the ground ! <EOS>
So now , you are banished from the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand . <EOS>
When you try to cultivate the ground it will no longer yield its best for you . You will be a homeless wanderer on the earth . @" <EOS>
Then Cain said to the Lord , "@ My punishment is too great to endure ! <EOS>
Look ! You are driving me off the land today , and I must hide from your presence . I will be a homeless wanderer on the earth ; whoever finds me will kill me . @" <EOS>
But the Lord said to him , "@ All right then , if anyone kills Cain , Cain will be avenged seven times as much . @" Then the Lord put a special mark on Cain so that no one who found him would strike him down . <EOS>
So Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and lived in the land of Nod , east of Eden . The Beginning of Civilization <EOS>
Cain had marital relations with his wife , and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch . Cain was building a city , and he named the city after his son Enoch . <EOS>
To Enoch was born Irad , and Irad was the father of Mehujael . Mehujael was the father of Methushael , and Methushael was the father of Lamech . <EOS>
Lamech took two wives for himself ; the name of the first was Adah , and the name of the second was Zillah . <EOS>
Adah gave birth to Jabal ; he was the first of those who live in tents and keep livestock . <EOS>
The name of his brother was Jubal ; he was the first of all who play the harp and the flute . <EOS>
Now Zillah also gave birth to Tubal @-@ Cain , who heated metal and shaped all kinds of tools made of bronze and iron . The sister of Tubal @-@ Cain was Naamah . <EOS>
Lamech said to his wives , "@ Adah and Zillah ! Listen to me ! You wives of Lamech , hear my words ! I have killed a man for wounding me , a young man for hurting me . <EOS>
If Cain is to be avenged seven times as much , then Lamech seventy @-@ seven times ! @" <EOS>
And Adam had marital relations with his wife again , and she gave birth to a son . She named him Seth , saying , "@ God has given me another child in place of Abel because Cain killed him . @" <EOS>
And a son was also born to Seth , whom he named Enosh . At that time people began to worship the Lord . <EOS>
