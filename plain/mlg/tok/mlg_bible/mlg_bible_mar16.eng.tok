When the Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought aromatic spices so that they might go and anoint him . <EOS>
And very early on the first day of the week , at sunrise , they went to the tomb . <EOS>
They had been asking each other , "@ Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb ? @" <EOS>
But when they looked up , they saw that the stone , which was very large , had been rolled back . <EOS>
Then as they went into the tomb , they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side ; and they were alarmed . <EOS>
But he said to them , "@ Do not be alarmed . You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene , who was crucified . He has been raised ! He is not here . Look , there is the place where they laid him . <EOS>
But go , tell his disciples , even Peter , that he is going ahead of you into Galilee . You will see him there , just as he told you . @" <EOS>
Then they went out and ran from the tomb , for terror and bewilderment had seized them . And they said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid . The Longer Ending of Mark [ [ <EOS>
Early on the first day of the week , after he arose , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had driven out seven demons . <EOS>
She went out and told those who were with him , while they were mourning and weeping . <EOS>
And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her , they did not believe . <EOS>
After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country . <EOS>
They went back and told the rest , but they did not believe them . <EOS>
Then he appeared to the eleven themselves , while they were eating , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected . <EOS>
He said to them , "@ Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature . <EOS>
The one who believes and is baptized will be saved , but the one who does not believe will be condemned . <EOS>
These signs will accompany those who believe @: In my name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new languages ; <EOS>
they will pick up snakes with their hands , and whatever poison they drink will not harm them ; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be well . @" <EOS>
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them , he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God . <EOS>
They went out and proclaimed everywhere , while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs . ] ] <EOS>
