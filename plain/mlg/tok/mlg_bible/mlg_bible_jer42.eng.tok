Then all the army officers , including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah and all the people of every class , went to the prophet Jeremiah . <EOS>
They said to him , "@ Please grant our request and pray to the Lord your God for all those of us who are still left alive here . For , as you yourself can see , there are only a few of us left out of the many there were before . <EOS>
Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do . @" <EOS>
The prophet Jeremiah answered them , "@ Agreed ! I will indeed pray to the Lord your God as you have asked . I will tell you everything the Lord replies in response to you . I will not keep anything back from you . @" <EOS>
They answered Jeremiah , "@ May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not do just as the Lord sends you to tell us to do . <EOS>
We will obey what the Lord our God to whom we are sending you tells us to do . It does not matter whether we like what he tells us or not . We will obey what he tells us to do so that things will go well for us . @" <EOS>
Ten days later the Lord spoke to Jeremiah . <EOS>
So Jeremiah summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people of every class . <EOS>
Then Jeremiah said to them , "@ You sent me to the Lord God of Israel to make your request known to him . Here is what he says to you @: <EOS>
‘ If you will just stay in this land , I will build you up . I will not tear you down . I will firmly plant you . I will not uproot you . For I am filled with sorrow because of the disaster that I have brought on you . <EOS>
Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear . Do not be afraid of him because I will be with you to save you and to rescue you from his power . I , the Lord , affirm it ! <EOS>
I will have compassion on you so that he in turn will have mercy on you and allow you to return to your land . ’ <EOS>
"@ You must not disobey the Lord your God by saying , ‘ We will not stay in this land . ’ <EOS>
You must not say , ‘ No , we will not stay . Instead we will go and live in the land of Egypt where we will not face war , or hear the enemy 's trumpet calls , or starve for lack of food . ’ <EOS>
If you people who remain in Judah do that , then listen to what the Lord says . The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says , ‘ If you are so determined to go to Egypt that you go and settle there , <EOS>
the wars you fear will catch up with you there in the land of Egypt . The starvation you are worried about will follow you there to Egypt . You will die there . <EOS>
All the people who are determined to go and settle in Egypt will die from war , starvation , or disease . No one will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them . ’ <EOS>
For the Lord God of Israel who rules over all says , ‘ If you go to Egypt , I will pour out my wrath on you just as I poured out my anger and wrath on the citizens of Jerusalem . You will become an object of horror and ridicule , an example of those who have been cursed and that people use in pronouncing a curse . You will never see this place again . ’ <EOS>
"@ The Lord has told you people who remain in Judah , ‘ Do not go to Egypt . ’ Be very sure of this @: I warn you here and now . <EOS>
You are making a fatal mistake . For you sent me to the Lord your God and asked me , ‘ Pray to the Lord our God for us . Tell us what the Lord our God says and we will do it . ’ <EOS>
This day I have told you what he said . But you do not want to obey the Lord by doing what he sent me to tell you . <EOS>
So now be very sure of this @: You will die from war , starvation , or disease in the place where you want to go and live . @" <EOS>
