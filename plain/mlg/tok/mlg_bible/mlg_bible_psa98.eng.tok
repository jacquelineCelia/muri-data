Sing to the Lord a new song , for he performs amazing deeds ! His right hand and his mighty arm accomplish deliverance . <EOS>
The Lord demonstrates his power to deliver ; in the sight of the nations he reveals his justice . <EOS>
He remains loyal and faithful to the family of Israel . All the ends of the earth see our God deliver us . <EOS>
Shout out praises to the Lord , all the earth ! Break out in a joyful shout and sing ! <EOS>
Sing to the Lord accompanied by a harp , accompanied by a harp and the sound of music ! <EOS>
With trumpets and the blaring of the ram 's horn , shout out praises before the king , the Lord ! <EOS>
Let the sea and everything in it shout , along with the world and those who live in it ! <EOS>
Let the rivers clap their hands ! Let the mountains sing in unison <EOS>
before the Lord ! For he comes to judge the earth ! He judges the world fairly , and the nations in a just manner . <EOS>
