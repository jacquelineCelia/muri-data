When the Lord restored the well @-@ being of Zion , we thought we were dreaming . <EOS>
At that time we laughed loudly and shouted for joy . At that time the nations said , "@ The Lord has accomplished great things for these people . @" <EOS>
The Lord did indeed accomplish great things for us . We were happy . <EOS>
O Lord , restore our well @-@ being , just as the streams in the arid south are replenished . <EOS>
Those who shed tears as they plant will shout for joy when they reap the harvest . <EOS>
The one who weeps as he walks along , carrying his bag of seed , will certainly come in with a shout of joy , carrying his sheaves of grain . <EOS>
