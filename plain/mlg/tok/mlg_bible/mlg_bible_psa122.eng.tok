I was glad because they said to me , "@ We will go to the Lord 's temple . @" <EOS>
Our feet are standing inside your gates , O Jerusalem . <EOS>
Jerusalem is a city designed to accommodate an assembly . <EOS>
The tribes go up there , the tribes of the Lord , where it is required that Israel give thanks to the name of the Lord . <EOS>
Indeed , the leaders sit there on thrones and make legal decisions , on the thrones of the house of David . <EOS>
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem ! May those who love her prosper ! <EOS>
May there be peace inside your defenses , and prosperity inside your fortresses ! <EOS>
For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors I will say , "@ May there be peace in you ! @" <EOS>
For the sake of the temple of the Lord our God I will pray for you to prosper . <EOS>
