When Israel left Egypt , when the family of Jacob left a foreign nation behind , <EOS>
Judah became his sanctuary , Israel his kingdom . <EOS>
The sea looked and fled ; the Jordan River turned back . <EOS>
The mountains skipped like rams , the hills like lambs . <EOS>
Why do you flee , O sea ? Why do you turn back , O Jordan River ? <EOS>
Why do you skip like rams , O mountains , like lambs , O hills ? <EOS>
Tremble , O earth , before the Lord - before the God of Jacob , <EOS>
who turned a rock into a pool of water , a hard rock into springs of water ! <EOS>
