Then Job answered @: <EOS>
"@ Even today my complaint is still bitter ; his hand is heavy despite my groaning . <EOS>
O that I knew where I might find him , that I could come to his place of residence ! <EOS>
I would lay out my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments . <EOS>
I would know with what words he would answer me , and understand what he would say to me . <EOS>
Would he contend with me with great power ? No , he would only pay attention to me . <EOS>
There an upright person could present his case before him , and I would be delivered forever from my judge . The Inaccessibility and Power of God <EOS>
"@ If I go to the east , he is not there , and to the west , yet I do not perceive him . <EOS>
In the north when he is at work , I do not see him ; when he turns to the south , I see no trace of him . <EOS>
But he knows the pathway that I take ; if he tested me , I would come forth like gold . <EOS>
My feet have followed his steps closely ; I have kept to his way and have not turned aside . <EOS>
I have not departed from the commands of his lips ; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion . <EOS>
But he is unchangeable , and who can change him ? Whatever he has desired , he does . <EOS>
For he fulfills his decree against me , and many such things are his plans . <EOS>
That is why I am terrified in his presence ; when I consider , I am afraid because of him . <EOS>
Indeed , God has made my heart faint ; the Almighty has terrified me . <EOS>
Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness , because of the thick darkness that covered my face . <EOS>
