O God , hear my cry for help ! Pay attention to my prayer ! <EOS>
From the most remote place on earth I call out to you in my despair . Lead me up to an inaccessible rocky summit ! <EOS>
Indeed , you are my shelter , a strong tower that protects me from the enemy . <EOS>
I will be a permanent guest in your home ; I will find shelter in the protection of your wings . ( Selah ) <EOS>
For you , O God , hear my vows ; you grant me the reward that belongs to your loyal followers . <EOS>
Give the king long life ! Make his lifetime span several generations ! <EOS>
May he reign forever before God ! Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him . <EOS>
Then I will sing praises to your name continually , as I fulfill my vows day after day . <EOS>
