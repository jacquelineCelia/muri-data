When I call out , answer me , O God who vindicates me ! Though I am hemmed in , you will lead me into a wide , open place . Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer ! <EOS>
You men , how long will you try to turn my honor into shame ? How long will you love what is worthless and search for what is deceptive ? ( Selah ) <EOS>
Realize that the Lord shows the godly special favor ; the Lord responds when I cry out to him . <EOS>
Tremble with fear and do not sin ! Meditate as you lie in bed , and repent of your ways ! ( Selah ) <EOS>
Offer the prescribed sacrifices and trust in the Lord ! <EOS>
Many say , "@ Who can show us anything good ? @" Smile upon us , Lord ! <EOS>
You make me happier than those who have abundant grain and wine . <EOS>
I will lie down and sleep peacefully , for you , Lord , make me safe and secure . <EOS>
