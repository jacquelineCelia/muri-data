By the rivers of Babylon we sit down and weep when we remember Zion . <EOS>
On the poplars in her midst we hang our harps , <EOS>
for there our captors ask us to compose songs ; those who mock us demand that we be happy , saying @: "@ Sing for us a song about Zion ! @" <EOS>
How can we sing a song to the Lord in a foreign land ? <EOS>
If I forget you , O Jerusalem , may my right hand be crippled ! <EOS>
May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth , if I do not remember you , and do not give Jerusalem priority over whatever gives me the most joy . <EOS>
Remember , O Lord , what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell . They said , "@ Tear it down , tear it down , right to its very foundation ! @" <EOS>
O daughter Babylon , soon to be devastated ! How blessed will be the one who repays you for what you dished out to us ! <EOS>
How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies and smashes them on a rock ! <EOS>
