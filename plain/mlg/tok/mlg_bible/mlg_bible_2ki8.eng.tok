Now Elisha advised the woman whose son he had brought back to life , "@ You and your family should go and live somewhere else for a while , for the Lord has decreed that a famine will overtake the land for seven years . @" <EOS>
So the woman did as the prophet said . She and her family went and lived in the land of the Philistines for seven years . <EOS>
After seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to ask the king to give her back her house and field . <EOS>
Now the king was talking to Gehazi , the prophet 's servant , and said , "@ Tell me all the great things which Elisha has done . @" <EOS>
While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life , the woman whose son he had brought back to life came to ask the king for her house and field . Gehazi said , "@ My master , O king , this is the very woman and this is her son whom Elisha brought back to life ! @" <EOS>
The king asked the woman about it , and she gave him the details . The king assigned a eunuch to take care of her request and ordered him , "@ Give her back everything she owns , as well as the amount of crops her field produced from the day she left the land until now . @" Elisha Meets with Hazael <EOS>
Elisha traveled to Damascus while King Ben Hadad of Syria was sick . The king was told , "@ The prophet has come here . @" <EOS>
So the king told Hazael , "@ Take a gift and go visit the prophet . Request from him an oracle from the Lord . Ask him , ‘ Will I recover from this sickness ? ’ @" <EOS>
So Hazael went to visit Elisha . He took along a gift , as well as forty camel loads of all the fine things of Damascus . When he arrived , he stood before him and said , "@ Your son , King Ben Hadad of Syria , has sent me to you with this question , ‘ Will I recover from this sickness ? ’ @" <EOS>
Elisha said to him , "@ Go and tell him , ‘ You will surely recover , ’ but the Lord has revealed to me that he will surely die . @" <EOS>
Elisha just stared at him until Hazael became uncomfortable . Then the prophet started crying . <EOS>
Hazael asked , "@ Why are you crying , my master ? @" He replied , "@ Because I know the trouble you will cause the Israelites . You will set fire to their fortresses , kill their young men with the sword , smash their children to bits , and rip open their pregnant women . @" <EOS>
Hazael said , "@ How could your servant , who is as insignificant as a dog , accomplish this great military victory ? @" Elisha answered , "@ The Lord has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria . @" <EOS>
He left Elisha and went to his master . Ben Hadad asked him , "@ What did Elisha tell you ? @" Hazael replied , "@ He told me you would surely recover . @" <EOS>
The next day Hazael took a piece of cloth , dipped it in water , and spread it over Ben Hadad 's face until he died . Then Hazael replaced him as king . Jehoram 's Reign over Judah <EOS>
In the fifth year of the reign of Israel 's King Joram , son of Ahab , Jehoshaphat 's son Jehoram became king over Judah . <EOS>
He was thirty @-@ two years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem . <EOS>
He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel , just as Ahab 's dynasty had done , for he married Ahab 's daughter . He did evil in the sight of the Lord . <EOS>
But the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah . He preserved Judah for the sake of his servant David to whom he had promised a perpetual dynasty . <EOS>
During his reign Edom freed themselves from Judah 's control and set up their own king . <EOS>
Joram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots . The Edomites , who had surrounded him , attacked at night and defeated him and his chariot officers . The Israelite army retreated to their homeland . <EOS>
So Edom has remained free from Judah 's control to this very day . At that same time Libnah also rebelled . <EOS>
The rest of the events of Joram 's reign , including a record of his accomplishments , are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah . <EOS>
Joram passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David . His son Ahaziah replaced him as king . Ahaziah Takes the Throne of Judah <EOS>
In the twelfth year of the reign of Israel 's King Joram , son of Ahab , Jehoram 's son Ahaziah became king over Judah . <EOS>
Ahaziah was twenty @-@ two years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem . His mother was Athaliah , the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel . <EOS>
He followed in the footsteps of Ahab 's dynasty and did evil in the sight of the Lord , like Ahab 's dynasty , for he was related to Ahab 's family . <EOS>
He joined Ahab 's son Joram in a battle against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth Gilead in which the Syrians defeated Joram . <EOS>
King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians in Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria . King Ahaziah son of Jehoram of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel , for he was ill . <EOS>
