Now Shephatiah son of Mattan , Gedaliah son of Pashhur , Jehucal son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur son of Malkijah had heard the things that Jeremiah had been telling the people . They had heard him say , <EOS>
"@ The Lord says , ‘ Those who stay in this city will die in battle or of starvation or disease . Those who leave the city and surrender to the Babylonians will live . They will escape with their lives . ’ @" <EOS>
They had also heard him say , "@ The Lord says , ‘ This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon . They will capture it . ’ @" <EOS>
So these officials said to the king , "@ This man must be put to death . For he is demoralizing the soldiers who are left in the city as well as all the other people there by these things he is saying . This man is not seeking to help these people but is trying to harm them . @" <EOS>
King Zedekiah said to them , "@ Very well , you can do what you want with him . For I can not do anything to stop you . @" <EOS>
So the officials took Jeremiah and put him in the cistern of Malkijah , one of the royal princes , that was in the courtyard of the guardhouse . There was no water in the cistern , only mud . So when they lowered Jeremiah into the cistern with ropes he sank in the mud . An Ethiopian Official Rescues Jeremiah from the Cistern <EOS>
An Ethiopian , Ebed Melech , a court official in the royal palace , heard that Jeremiah had been put in the cistern . While the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate , <EOS>
Ebed Melech departed the palace and went to speak to the king . He said to him , <EOS>
"@ Your royal Majesty , those men have been very wicked in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah . They have thrown him into a cistern and he is sure to die of starvation there because there is no food left in the city . <EOS>
Then the king gave Ebed Melech the Ethiopian the following order @: "@ Take thirty men with you from here and go pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies . @" <EOS>
So Ebed Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasure room in the palace . He got some worn @-@ out clothes and old rags from there and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern . <EOS>
Ebed Melech called down to Jeremiah , "@ Put these rags and worn @-@ out clothes under your armpits to pad the ropes . Jeremiah did as Ebed Melech instructed . <EOS>
So they pulled Jeremiah up from the cistern with ropes . Jeremiah , however , still remained confined to the courtyard of the guardhouse . Jeremiah Responds to Zedekiah 's Request for Secret Advice <EOS>
Some time later Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah brought to him at the third entrance of the Lord 's temple . The king said to Jeremiah , "@ I would like to ask you a question . Do not hide anything from me when you answer . @" <EOS>
Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , "@ If I answer you , you will certainly kill me . If I give you advice , you will not listen to me . @" <EOS>
So King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah and sealed it with an oath . He promised , "@ As surely as the Lord lives who has given us life and breath , I promise you this @: I will not kill you or hand you over to those men who want to kill you . @" <EOS>
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , "@ The Lord , the God who rules over all , the God of Israel , says , ‘ You must surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon . If you do , your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down . Indeed , you and your whole family will be spared . <EOS>
But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon , this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down . You yourself will not escape from them . ’ @" <EOS>
Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , "@ I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Babylonians . The Babylonians might hand me over to them and they will torture me . @" <EOS>
Then Jeremiah answered , "@ You will not be handed over to them . Please obey the Lord by doing what I have been telling you . Then all will go well with you and your life will be spared . <EOS>
But if you refuse to surrender , the Lord has shown me a vision of what will happen . Here is what I saw @: <EOS>
All the women who are left in the royal palace of Judah will be led out to the officers of the king of Babylon . They will taunt you saying , ‘ Your trusted friends misled you ; they have gotten the best of you . Now that your feet are stuck in the mud , they have turned their backs on you . ’ <EOS>
"@ All your wives and your children will be turned over to the Babylonians . You yourself will not escape from them but will be captured by the king of Babylon . This city will be burned down . @" <EOS>
Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah , "@ Do not let anyone know about the conversation we have had . If you do , you will die . <EOS>
The officials may hear that I have talked with you . They may come to you and say , ‘ Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you . Do not hide anything from us . If you do , we will kill you . ’ <EOS>
If they do this , tell them , ‘ I was pleading with the king not to send me back to die in the dungeon of Jonathan 's house . ’ @" <EOS>
All the officials did indeed come and question Jeremiah . He told them exactly what the king had instructed him to say . They stopped questioning him any further because no one had actually heard their conversation . <EOS>
So Jeremiah remained confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse until the day Jerusalem was captured . The Fall of Jerusalem and Its Aftermath The following events occurred when Jerusalem was captured . <EOS>
