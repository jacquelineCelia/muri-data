With regard to the collection for the saints , please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia @: <EOS>
On the first day of the week , each of you should set aside some income and save it to the extent that God has blessed you , so that a collection will not have to be made when I come . <EOS>
Then , when I arrive , I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem . <EOS>
And if it seems advisable that I should go also , they will go with me . Paul 's Plans to Visit <EOS>
But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia - for I will be going through Macedonia - <EOS>
and perhaps I will stay with you , or even spend the winter , so that you can send me on my journey , wherever I go . <EOS>
For I do not want to see you now in passing , since I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord allows . <EOS>
But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost , <EOS>
because a door of great opportunity stands wide open for me , but there are many opponents . <EOS>
Now if Timothy comes , see that he has nothing to fear among you , for he is doing the Lord 's work , as I am too . <EOS>
So then , let no one treat him with contempt . But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me . For I am expecting him with the brothers . <EOS>
With regard to our brother Apollos @: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers , but it was simply not his intention to come now . He will come when he has the opportunity . Final Challenge and Blessing <EOS>
Stay alert , stand firm in the faith , show courage , be strong . <EOS>
Everything you do should be done in love . <EOS>
Now , brothers and sisters , you know about the household of Stephanus , that as the first converts of Achaia , they devoted themselves to ministry for the saints . I urge you <EOS>
also to submit to people like this , and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard . <EOS>
I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus , Fortunatus , and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked . <EOS>
For they refreshed my spirit and yours . So then , recognize people like this . <EOS>
The churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you . Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord , with the church that meets in their house . <EOS>
All the brothers and sisters send greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss . <EOS>
I , Paul , send this greeting with my own hand . <EOS>
Let anyone who has no love for the Lord be accursed . Our Lord , come ! <EOS>
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you . <EOS>
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus . <EOS>
