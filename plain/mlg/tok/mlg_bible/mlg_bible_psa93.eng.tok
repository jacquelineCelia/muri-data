The Lord reigns ! He is robed in majesty , the Lord is robed , he wears strength around his waist . Indeed , the world is established , it can not be moved . <EOS>
Your throne has been secure from ancient times ; you have always been king . <EOS>
The waves roar , O Lord , the waves roar , the waves roar and crash . <EOS>
Above the sound of the surging water , and the mighty waves of the sea , the Lord sits enthroned in majesty . <EOS>
The rules you set down are completely reliable . Holiness aptly adorns your house , O Lord , forever . <EOS>
