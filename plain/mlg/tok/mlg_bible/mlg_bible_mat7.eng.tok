"@ Do not judge so that you will not be judged . <EOS>
For by the standard you judge you will be judged , and the measure you use will be the measure you receive . <EOS>
Why do you see the speck in your brother 's eye , but fail to see the beam of wood in your own ? <EOS>
Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me remove the speck from your eye , ’ while there is a beam in your own ? <EOS>
You hypocrite ! First remove the beam from your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother 's eye . <EOS>
Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs ; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces . Ask , Seek , Knock <EOS>
"@ Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened for you . <EOS>
For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks , the door will be opened . <EOS>
Is there anyone among you who , if his son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? <EOS>
Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a snake ? <EOS>
If you then , although you are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him ! <EOS>
In everything , treat others as you would want them to treat you , for this fulfills the law and the prophets . The Narrow Gate <EOS>
"@ Enter through the narrow gate , because the gate is wide and the way is spacious that leads to destruction , and there are many who enter through it . <EOS>
But the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life , and there are few who find it . A Tree and Its Fruit <EOS>
"@ Watch out for false prophets , who come to you in sheep 's clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves . <EOS>
You will recognize them by their fruit . Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles , are they ? <EOS>
In the same way , every good tree bears good fruit , but the bad tree bears bad fruit . <EOS>
A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit , nor a bad tree to bear good fruit . <EOS>
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . <EOS>
So then , you will recognize them by their fruit . Judgment of Pretenders <EOS>
"@ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven - only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven . <EOS>
On that day , many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , did n't we prophesy in your name , and in your name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds ? ’ <EOS>
Then I will declare to them , ‘ I never knew you . Go away from me , you lawbreakers ! ’ Hearing and Doing <EOS>
"@ Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock . <EOS>
The rain fell , the flood came , and the winds beat against that house , but it did not collapse because it had been founded on rock . <EOS>
Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand . <EOS>
The rain fell , the flood came , and the winds beat against that house , and it collapsed ; it was utterly destroyed ! @" <EOS>
When Jesus finished saying these things , the crowds were amazed by his teaching , <EOS>
because he taught them like one who had authority , not like their experts in the law . <EOS>
