If the Lord does not build a house , then those who build it work in vain . If the Lord does not guard a city , then the watchman stands guard in vain . <EOS>
It is vain for you to rise early , come home late , and work so hard for your food . Yes , he can provide for those whom he loves even when they sleep . <EOS>
Yes , sons are a gift from the Lord , the fruit of the womb is a reward . <EOS>
Sons born during one 's youth are like arrows in a warrior 's hand . <EOS>
How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them ! They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate . <EOS>
