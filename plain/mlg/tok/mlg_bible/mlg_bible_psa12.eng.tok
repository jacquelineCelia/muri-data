Deliver , Lord ! For the godly have disappeared ; people of integrity have vanished . <EOS>
People lie to one another ; they flatter and deceive . <EOS>
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that boasts ! <EOS>
They say , "@ We speak persuasively ; we know how to flatter and boast . Who is our master ? @" <EOS>
"@ Because of the violence done to the oppressed , because of the painful cries of the needy , I will spring into action , " says the Lord . "@ I will provide the safety they so desperately desire . @" <EOS>
The Lord 's words are absolutely reliable . They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground , where it is thoroughly refined . <EOS>
You , Lord , will protect them ; you will continually shelter each one from these evil people , <EOS>
for the wicked seem to be everywhere , when people promote evil . <EOS>
