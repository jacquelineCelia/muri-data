This is a message about Babylon that God revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz @: <EOS>
On a bare hill raise a signal flag , shout to them , wave your hand , so they might enter the gates of the princes ! <EOS>
I have given orders to my chosen soldiers ; I have summoned the warriors through whom I will vent my anger , my boasting , arrogant ones . <EOS>
There is a loud noise on the mountains - it sounds like a large army ! There is great commotion among the kingdoms - nations are being assembled ! The Lord who commands armies is mustering forces for battle . <EOS>
They come from a distant land , from the horizon . It is the Lord with his instruments of judgment , coming to destroy the whole earth . <EOS>
Wail , for the Lord 's day of judgment is near ; it comes with all the destructive power of the sovereign judge . <EOS>
For this reason all hands hang limp , every human heart loses its courage . <EOS>
They panic - cramps and pain seize hold of them like those of a woman who is straining to give birth . They look at one another in astonishment ; their faces are flushed red . <EOS>
Look , the Lord 's day of judgment is coming ; it is a day of cruelty and savage , raging anger , destroying the earth and annihilating its sinners . <EOS>
Indeed the stars in the sky and their constellations no longer give out their light ; the sun is darkened as soon as it rises , and the moon does not shine . <EOS>
I will punish the world for its evil , and wicked people for their sin . I will put an end to the pride of the insolent , I will bring down the arrogance of tyrants . <EOS>
I will make human beings more scarce than pure gold , and people more scarce than gold from Ophir . <EOS>
So I will shake the heavens , and the earth will shake loose from its foundation , because of the fury of the Lord who commands armies , in the day he vents his raging anger . <EOS>
Like a frightened gazelle or a sheep with no shepherd , each will turn toward home , each will run to his homeland . <EOS>
Everyone who is caught will be stabbed ; everyone who is seized will die by the sword . <EOS>
Their children will be smashed to pieces before their very eyes ; their houses will be looted and their wives raped . <EOS>
Look , I am stirring up the Medes to attack them ; they are not concerned about silver , nor are they interested in gold . <EOS>
Their arrows will cut young men to ribbons ; they have no compassion on a person 's offspring , they will not look with pity on children . <EOS>
Babylon , the most admired of kingdoms , the Chaldeans ' source of honor and pride , will be destroyed by God just as Sodom and Gomorrah were . <EOS>
No one will live there again ; no one will ever reside there again . No bedouin will camp there , no shepherds will rest their flocks there . <EOS>
Wild animals will rest there , the ruined houses will be full of hyenas . Ostriches will live there , wild goats will skip among the ruins . <EOS>
Wild dogs will yip in her ruined fortresses , jackals will yelp in the once @-@ splendid palaces . Her time is almost up , her days will not be prolonged . <EOS>
