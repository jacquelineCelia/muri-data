In the Lord I have taken shelter . How can you say to me , "@ Flee to a mountain like a bird ! <EOS>
For look , the wicked prepare their bows , they put their arrows on the strings , to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright . <EOS>
When the foundations are destroyed , what can the godly accomplish ? @" <EOS>
The Lord is in his holy temple ; the Lord 's throne is in heaven . His eyes watch ; his eyes examine all people . <EOS>
The Lord approves of the godly , but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence . <EOS>
May the Lord rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked ! A whirlwind is what they deserve ! <EOS>
Certainly the Lord is just ; he rewards godly deeds ; the upright will experience his favor . <EOS>
