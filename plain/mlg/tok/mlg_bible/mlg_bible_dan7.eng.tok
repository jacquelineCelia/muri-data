In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon , Daniel had a dream filled with visions while he was lying on his bed . Then he wrote down the dream in summary fashion . <EOS>
Daniel explained @: "@ I was watching in my vision during the night as the four winds of the sky were stirring up the great sea . <EOS>
Then four large beasts came up from the sea ; they were different from one another . <EOS>
"@ The first one was like a lion with eagles ' wings . As I watched , its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the ground . It was made to stand on two feet like a human being , and a human mind was given to it . <EOS>
"@ Then a second beast appeared , like a bear . It was raised up on one side , and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . It was told , ‘ Get up and devour much flesh ! ’ <EOS>
"@ After these things , as I was watching , another beast like a leopard appeared , with four bird @-@ like wings on its back . This beast had four heads , and ruling authority was given to it . <EOS>
"@ After these things , as I was watching in the night visions a fourth beast appeared - one dreadful , terrible , and very strong . It had two large rows of iron teeth . It devoured and crushed , and anything that was left it trampled with its feet . It was different from all the beasts that came before it , and it had ten horns . <EOS>
"@ As I was contemplating the horns , another horn - a small one - came up between them , and three of the former horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it . This horn had eyes resembling human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things . <EOS>
"@ While I was watching , thrones were set up , and the Ancient of Days took his seat . His attire was white like snow ; the hair of his head was like lamb 's wool . His throne was ablaze with fire and its wheels were all aflame . <EOS>
A river of fire was streaming forth and proceeding from his presence . Many thousands were ministering to him ; Many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him . The court convened and the books were opened . <EOS>
"@ Then I kept on watching because of the arrogant words of the horn that was speaking . I was watching until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and thrown into the flaming fire . <EOS>
As for the rest of the beasts , their ruling authority had already been removed , though they were permitted to go on living for a time and a season . <EOS>
I was watching in the night visions , "@ And with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man was approaching . He went up to the Ancient of Days and was escorted before him . <EOS>
To him was given ruling authority , honor , and sovereignty . All peoples , nations , and language groups were serving him . His authority is eternal and will not pass away . His kingdom will not be destroyed . An Angel Interprets Daniel 's Vision <EOS>
"@ As for me , Daniel , my spirit was distressed , and the visions of my mind were alarming me . <EOS>
I approached one of those standing nearby and asked him about the meaning of all this . So he spoke with me and revealed to me the interpretation of the vision @: <EOS>
‘ These large beasts , which are four in number , represent four kings who will arise from the earth . <EOS>
The holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will take possession of the kingdom forever and ever . ’ <EOS>
"@ Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast , which was different from all the others . It was very dreadful , with two rows of iron teeth and bronze claws , and it devoured , crushed , and trampled anything that was left with its feet . <EOS>
I also wanted to know the meaning of the ten horns on its head , and of that other horn which came up and before which three others fell . This was the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogant things , whose appearance was more formidable than the others . <EOS>
While I was watching , that horn began to wage war against the holy ones and was defeating them , <EOS>
until the Ancient of Days arrived and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Most High . Then the time came for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom . <EOS>
"@ This is what he told me @: ‘ The fourth beast means that there will be a fourth kingdom on earth that will differ from all the other kingdoms . It will devour all the earth and will trample and crush it . <EOS>
The ten horns mean that ten kings will arise from that kingdom . Another king will arise after them , but he will be different from the earlier ones . He will humiliate three kings . <EOS>
He will speak words against the Most High . He will harass the holy ones of the Most High continually . His intention will be to change times established by law . They will be delivered into his hand For a time , times , and half a time . <EOS>
But the court will convene , and his ruling authority will be removed - destroyed and abolished forever ! <EOS>
Then the kingdom , authority , and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be delivered to the people of the holy ones of the Most High . His kingdom is an eternal kingdom ; all authorities will serve him and obey him . ’ <EOS>
"@ This is the conclusion of the matter . As for me , Daniel , my thoughts troubled me greatly , and the color drained from my face . But I kept the matter to myself . @" <EOS>
