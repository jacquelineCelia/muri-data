@FarahSaafan : Does anyone know where I can buy a safety helmet ? <EOS>
Not the motorbikes helmet , the safety helmet for work sites or that Journalists wear ! <EOS>
And Ahmed Al Ish advises @: <EOS>
: Whoever is coming to the ousted president 's trial on Wednesday should first buy a plastic helmet from the industrial safety shops on Gomhoriya Street for five pounds . <EOS>
Lawyer Gamal Eid , who attended the trial and runs the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( ANHRI ) , notes ( Ar ) : <EOS>
@gamaleid : The public prosecution duped the Egyptian people and presented witnesses who would make murderers become innocent instead of charging them . <EOS>
The public prosecutor does not represent the people . <EOS>
The situation is disgusting and demoralising <EOS>
Editor and presenter Yosri Fouda sarcastically adds : <EOS>
@YosriFouda <EOS>
@YosriFouda : At the next trial , it would be Tahrir Square that pounced on the American University and killed Mubarak and Adly and 800 members of the security forces <EOS>
