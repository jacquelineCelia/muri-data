Foreigner carrying grenades @: Held in jail in Antanimora <EOS>
A foreigner named Mohamad Amad , residing around Mandrosoa Ivato and carrying grenades and two guns ( 7,65 mm and a bird gun ) , was handed over to authorities . <EOS>
According to local news , he was held in jail in Antanimora after his appearance before the judge . <EOS>
In this case , the foreigner was charged with disturbing public order . <EOS>
These powerful weapons were found during the search of his home on Monday . <EOS>
More discussion about weapons . <EOS>
Why not liberalize the carrying of guns like in the United States ? <EOS> That will allow the people to protect themselves against the villains . <EOS>
Looks like the villains are the one protected , not talking about the self @-@ proclaimed human rights activists . <EOS>
Like this foreigner carrying grenades . <EOS>
Apparently , he knows some high @-@ level authority . <EOS> So if that high @-@ level person protects him , why not interrogate him and keep him in jail ? <EOS>
