Hi Chris

It's always great to hear about people doing interesting things with Kinyarwanda. All of our data is available under this Creative Commons Licence so you're free to do what you want within that licence. I've attached a recent XML dump and can provide updated data in the future. All entries are stored by lemma/prefix and I hope the XML format will be fairly self-explanatory.

I'd be very interested in hearing how your work progresses.
