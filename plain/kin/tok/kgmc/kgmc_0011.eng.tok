My name is Mukundwa Safi , I am 21 years old , and before the genocide we lived in Kibuye , in the former commune of Gitesi , currently known as Karongi community , in the Bwishyura sector , the sector kept its old name , Bwishyura cellule . <EOS>
How many members did your family have before the genocide ? <EOS>
Before the genocide we were a family of five , we also had other members from the extended family , we lived with our grandmother and a cousin of my mother . <EOS>
When the genocide started were you in Kibuye ? <EOS>
I was in Kibuye when the genocide started , I was eight years old . <EOS>
Could you give as an account of your experiences during the genocide and how you managed to survive ; could you in a few words recount how you lived through the genocide from its beginning and how it was carried out in your area of Kibuye ? <EOS>
The genocide ; In the morning after Habyarimana 's death ; I was still a child and I did n't understand but our parents told us to stay in the house , not to go anywhere and stay home ; at that time we stayed home , my mother later sent me to town ; our town was a small centre ; on my way there , when I was nearing my destination , I met this lady who was like an auntie to me , her name was Marie Goreth , she was so angry she nearly hit me , she ordered me to run home otherwise I was going to be killed there ; at that time people had started looting the town centre ; some shops were being looted while others were left alone , I did n't know why ; then there was this relative of mine who did business in this part of the centre , I saw him run and some people welding machetes were chasing after him , at that point Kayishema had fired bullets and the genocide had started in Kibuye , that is how the genocide started in our area of Kibuye . <EOS>
Two days later , that was on the ninth of that month ; the men and elder boys went up towards Bisesero , we remained with mother and my brother who was a little older than me , he was called Claude , we stayed home , as you can understand we were very scared and my mother was very worried about the events that were unfolding , it was not an easy situation . We stayed at home and the food cooked was left untouched on the fire stones because people were too scared and we only ate after a few days ; after a few days , someone came to our home , my mother worked in the ministry of works , she had helped that person get a job ; he came running and screaming ; quick , quick , you are the third on the list of those to be killed and whose property is to be destroyed ; my mother got hold of a few things ; she only took a few things ; she asked us to move with the people who were moving towards the sports stadium , we lived near the side of the road ; after some time we moved into the sports stadium , we had initially stayed at home but we were told we should move or we would be killed , so we went and joined the others in the sports stadium , it was about the tenth of that month , that is an estimate , I can not remember the dates very well ; we went to the sports stadium and found many people with the same problem as ours , we stayed there for about two weeks ; we soon run out of food we had brought with us , mother had a little money , she used the money to buy some food , some people in the stadium had brought their cattle with them and were now slaughtering them because of the food shortage ; people were buying meat but only able to cook it with dry grass because there was no firewood and once you had entered the stadium you were n't able to leave , there were very many road @-@ blocks and those soldiers would not let you leave , we were also very thirsty because there was n't enough water , there were no toilets either and people started getting sick because of dirt , we stayed there until the eighteenth , I will always remember that date , there are two dates that I will always remember . <EOS>
The eighteenth of April , it was about two o'clock in the afternoon when three buses arrived with people singing and hanging on them , they were singing genocide songs ; the genocide songs that they sang at that time , those songs that you all know , they got off the buses and kept singing , for those who know the Kibuye sports stadium , Gatwaro is in a low laying area with hills on either sides , we were in the middle , then they started to shoot into the crowd . <EOS>
One of my first terrible images of the genocide is one that always comes back to me , there was this man , who claimed to have become a Hutu following some Rwandan customs , he moved up towards the Interahamwe on the Gatwaro hill , when he got close enough one of them picked an axe and hit him splitting him open like firewood , they cut his body into two pieces and threw him back into the stadium . <EOS>
Many people died during that period , many people died in the stadium , when I was with my parents , there was a man named Mutabagisha Thomas , he was a pastor ; I usually loved to pray very much and I loved to go to him to hear him talk about God , I used to go to listen to children stories about God from the bible , so when the Interahamwe came , I was with my mother , I immediately looked for a way to find the pastor but I was not able to get to him , I lost him , I went back to look for my mother who was also worried about me , when I got back I found my mother 's sister and grandmother had been shot ; after they died , my mother covered them with a sheet of cloth , I took the sheet of cloth off to look at them , I felt so angry but my mother told me to calm down , she told me to keep quiet which I did ; when my mother was covering the bodies she was also hit by a bullet but it was not serious . <EOS>
We stayed on in that situation , they sometimes threw in smoke grenades into the crowd and we poured water on them , after some time we had no more water and no more energy and that is when they wanted to come down into the stadium and start hacking people with machetes , in the stadium there were some tough men like a man called Emile , I remember him , he was a family friend and his wife worked with my mother , he asked people to gather stones , he was like a leader , he ordered people to stone the Interahamwe to keep them away , shooting rather than letting them come down and start hacking with machetes , time went on and about six thirty in the evening , it was dusk , the Interahamwe started using whistles to create chaos , I was never hit by a bullet , the Interahamwe then called it a day and left fearing they would shoot each other because it was becoming dark , we also prepared for the following day . Early next morning , we left the stadium , the smell in the stadium is one of the things I always remember about the genocide , it was a terrible smell , people had died , animals had died , some cattle had been shot , some food had gone bad , when we got home , we found a child , about nine months old , the baby had been shot in the abdomen , it was my auntie 's baby , it was a very nice baby that everyone loved , it was very sad . <EOS>
After shooting her in the ribs ; I thought that my mother was dying and she was going to breath and her intestines would come out , it 's one of the things that hurt me most in the genocide , I will never forget it ; later when it was sunset ; it was night , about eight o'clock , after some time people organized themselves and said they were going to Busesero , others said they could not make it there with such a number ; many people had remained in the stadium , some who had been shot , those who could not come out because they were wounded , my mother and I left the stadium ; we left the stadium and headed for the Gatwaro forest , on our way I lost my mother , I cried very much but the people with me ordered me to keep quiet . <EOS>
My mother later returned looking for me , she found me , and we continued together , we slept in the forest . My mother said that she knew some Congolese who taught Forestry , we should get to them and they will be able to help us cross to the other side . We had many relatives who lived in Congo , so we moved . At the time we got to Gatwaro forest , a lot of rain fell , there was thunder and lightning , it rained until the following morning then through the day up to three o'clock in the afternoon , we were in the forest with nowhere to shelter from the rain , we were cold , hungry and all other things <EOS>
We continued in the forest until a point when the Interahamwe came in with dogs , they brought dogs to hunt us and they were able to find some people , they would shout that they have seen someone and if you got scared and run then you would give yourself out and they would chase you and kill you . I know many people among my relatives who ran and they were chased and killed . We were in that forest but I do n't know why they were not able to see us ; we were able to see them and that is why I am able to tell you about the many things I saw , in that forest you could be in a position to see a person while that person was unable to see you <EOS>
You see when the rain came down it was mixing with blood , it was very scary , that was life in the forest , that evening we left the forest , my mother said we should go and try to find the Congolese and see if they could help us in anyway ; we left together with my brother and another small boy whose elder brother , Jean , worked at a pharmacy in Kibuye . Jean 's family was not from Kibuye , they were from Kigali . Jean 's little brother was just visiting and he did not know anyone , I do n't know how my mother spotted him and she then asked him to come with us , we left together ; we moved down the forest towards Lake Kivu ; To go to Nyamishamba , one needs to go past Lake Kivu . We saw a lot of bodies at Lake Kivu , we heard that many of these people had been killed in the Friday market day and their bodies had been piled onto a truck and dumped here . We saw very many bodies in that place , they seemed to be white as they reflected the moonlight , we moved on because we were very scared , we also saw trees and we kept thinking they we people only later to realize they were trees . <EOS>
We moved on until we got to Nyamishamba , when we got closer to where the Congolese lived , we found the doors and windows and all the house property had been taken and someone had been killed there ; I did not know these people , I only remember my mother saying that someone had been killed in that house that night ; here , here , someone said , the Inyenzi rebels have attacked , I thought these people may have seen those who left the stadium and were trying to get to Bisesero . These people may have seen them and mistaken them for rebels . I remember mother saying , these people must be mocking us , if only those rebels came . <EOS>
We stayed and slept there , in the morning , my mother who had a stomach problem , woke up hiccupping ; she hiccupped so much and being a child I started to cry , I cried hard and my mother tried to calm me down saying that it was going to be alright . I thought she was going to die . I was also thinking about many things because she had a stomach problem and we were hungry . We had slept in the other house ; in the morning ; about five o'clock , some people came to the house ; the Interahamwe came to the house ; they said that the people we saw last night might be hiding in these ruins , so they decided to check the house , that is how they found us , they immediately saw us , they ordered us out and with many others took us to Nyamishaba , they took all of us to the Gasura sector <EOS>
At the Gasura sector , about one hundred people had already been killed , many people had been killed and their bodies had been put up in piles ; the bodies had already started decomposing and as a child I had a problem with nausea and vomiting , when I saw the bodies that had been piled , I felt nauseated and that also made one Interahamwe nauseated and he hit me on the arm with a stick , when he hit me the nausea went away , since that day I no longer have that problem When we got there we found a girl called Claudine , she was down , hacked by machetes and had been stripped naked . My mother took a sheet of clothing and gave it to her . When the girl saw my mother she cried out to her , she said she had been raped and hacked with machetes , you see my mother , my mother was , I do n't know if I can say she was weak , she was affected by such a situation , she sat down and started crying , she told the girl to persevere because there was nothing any of us could do , that is how life is , you have to remain strong <EOS>
The Interahamwe at that point had not given us any orders , then suddenly they came , I think they had been in a meeting , they ordered us to dig pits , go did pits they said , children will bury children , you should bury your relatives , the rest will be buried on top to cover the pits and we all thought that is how it was going to be . <EOS>
People then started to dig up the pits ; When we got to the Nyamishaba memorial many people had already been killed and we were throwing them , I mean we were burying them , but the Interahamwe had ordered us to throw them into the pits . I saw many children , I saw three children that I had gone to school with , they were still alive , burying their friends and some hands were coming of the bodies because those bodies had already started to decompose , those are some of the memories that I get from the genocide , I do n't like thinking about it ; our people were desecrated . <EOS>
You see it was my first time to see a dead person , then I was soon forced to carry them and I was not able to do well because of reasons beyond my control , after the burials they ordered us to move forward to be killed , that is when my mother leaned against a raised wall of soil , she stopped hiccupping . There was a lady who lived in Nyamishaba , I did not know her name ; I tried to ask people about her name , gave her description but no one seemed to know her . She helped us a lot , she helped small children and my mother when she was sick , she gave us porridge with no sugar , she helped us in ways she could , she also gave us sweet potatoes to eat but we knew elsewhere we were heading for death <EOS>
After a short while , the Interahamwe let us go but just before that they separated the men and boys from the rest and took them away . We then continued to move with my elder brother and the other small boy because he was a visitor in Kibuye and was quite young , I do n't know why they were n't taken with the men and other boys , they came to us and we left together . My mother said she there was a family friend called Visa , let 's go to his home , let 's see if they can shelter us because the Congolese were n't able , they had already left for their country . <EOS>
We then left Nyamishaba ; we moved until we reached a place where the Ministry of works ' garage was situated , the guard there saw us , he knew us because that is where my mother worked , he laughed and asked , you are still alive ? My mother pleaded with him to pity us and keep quiet and let us in because there was a group of killers that was behind us , my mother then suggested we should get inside and I asked her , how do you trust the guard ? They may kill us at anytime , my mother then said that I should not be scared because she had helped him get the job he would be kind to us and he would not harm us . We then decided to go there ; he then asked , what are you still doing here ? My mother started pleading with him she even took her jewelry off her neck and gave it to him , he then asked if we had any money , and she hesitated for a while and before she answered he raised an alarm screaming , "@ inyenzi @"@ , "@ inyenzi @" and the group of killers that we were running from found us . <EOS>
When they saw my mother they screamed , they were surprised she was still alive , they got hold of her and hacked her with a machete , that is what I saw , I even saw the machete , she immediately fell down with fear and the whole group descended on her with machetes , I do n't know what part they hacked but I saw them hack all parts of the body , I was like someone who was losing my mind , my brother kept calling me , @"@ fill @" that was my pet name at home , please hurry he was pushing me away , when he pushed me away he remained behind and he was hacked together with the other child , the group split into two and the followed the small boy and also hacked him , the boy who was visiting was hacked , when my brother pushed me , I fell down into a garden of sweet potatoes , I quietly crawled away and hid behind a tree , it was a bit dark , it was about quarter to seven o'clock and in the rainy season it was already dark . <EOS>
After hacking the others to death they were leaving when suddenly one said ; they were with another child , where is the other child ? They started searching for me , the guard was with them searching for me and he was the last person I saw and he hit me with a slasher and I lost consciousness ; he hit me on the arm because I had seen other people use machetes to hack , I had seen many people who had been hacked at the forest in Nyamishamba , most were hacked on the head , that is why I raised my arm , when I raised my hand above my head , he first hit me with a slasher which was not sharp but my hand bled badly , he then hit me on the head with a club , the club had nails and my head bled a lot , they also slashed my leg and stabbed me ; they also slashed my ribs , I think I tried to turn I am not sure , I only felt the blows to the hand and head and after that I lost consciousness ; I was unconscious , I was not able to talk , I was not able to think , I was not able to do anything but the last thing I heard the guard , Francois Sinzabakira , saying was " pay me back if you can @" <EOS>
I do n't know how much time I spent unconscious ; I did not seem to remember everything that happened , I stayed there a little longer , I then slept until sunset when I came around again . I slowly regained consciousness and woke up hearing the wind ; Being close to Lake Kivu , it was cold ; I was hearing the wind and noises from the valley below wondering where I was . What am I doing here ? I then remembered how the Interahamwe had attacked , how they had hacked my mother to death , how they had hacked my brother to death , how they had hacked the other child , I did n't see how they hacked him but I clearly saw the rest , I did n't see this child because he was a small distance away but I could hear his screams , I kept on gathering my thoughts up to the point I remembered how I had been attacked and the first time I had looked at my arm , I saw that the bones had been exposed and were in pieces ; I realized the pieces of bone were not attached . <EOS>
I kept on realizing where I was , at that time I was wearing a dress , it had been torn to pieces by the machetes and was full of blood , I then thought about checking other parts of the body , and they were also full of blood , the whole body as it was , with mud from the valley , water and other things ; That was at the sunset , early in the morning I wanted to ; when I regained consciousness I wanted to know truly if my family had died . <EOS>
I really wanted to know if my family was dead or still living , I had stopped feeling like a child and was now feeling like a grown adult , a responsible person , although I say that , getting up was not easy , it was difficult , you see , when your legs are injured , you use your arms to get up , it was n't easy ; I crawled towards my brother who was lying next to me , I looked and saw his neck had been hacked and only something small here was holding his neck together , he was dead , I asked him , are you still alive ? Just like someone can ask you a question , voices are not clear . I was a child and I did n't know that the voices are not clear . He asked me , are you still alive ? Voice is not clear . He had been traumatized , I thought about how I would have been taken and killed , I showed him bodies , I kept quiet , I did n't have what to say to him ; At that point the man took me and gave me tea ; They got me other clothes and took off the clothes stained with blood , that auntie gave me a bath and helped me wear the new clothes . <EOS>
Later about eight o'clock that morning , I went to Visa 's house , they had told me that Visa was a friend of the family , let 's see if they can give us any help , so we left , when he saw me , he immediately shouted ; Fille , you are still alive ? And I said yes , I immediately entered the house , they took me in and gave me some food and because I had not eaten in many days , I felt like there were some wounds in my throat , voices are not clear , I was hungry but I failed to eat , I asked them give me some water , give me some water , and then Visa told the husband of my auntie that their house was always being searched and they did n't know where to hide me , let 's take her to the back of the house in the sorghum garden until the sunset . <EOS>
I was taken to the sorghum garden and when I got to the sorghum garden I did n't feel like staying there . The neighboring house belong to a man named Emile , he and his wife had already been killed , I do n't remember how I came to think of this , I was n't able to stand , I crawled into their home , I entered a room and pulled myself near a door that was about here ; The family was here and I was by their side , voices are not clear . There was blood everywhere . voices are not clear Honestly , I could not believe it , someone gave them directions because they came knowing I was hiding there , they did n't find me because I had already left , they looked around after failing to find me , you see an empty house gives echoes so I was able to hear their voices , they were in the living room , you see that room had a lot paper scattered on the ground , so they said , let 's look around and see if we can find Emile 's Inkotanyi papers , so they started looking through the papers and were moving in my direction , one even nearly stepped on me but picked a piece of paper and left , I am not sure he saw me or not . I stayed there for about four hours , later that evening I crawled back into the sorghum garden , there was a nearby maize garden owned by someone named Patel <EOS>
Patel , I mean his wife , Patel was not there at that time , his wife , her younger brother and a worker came to harvest some maize and saw me , they were very surprised ; Ehh , this child is still alive ? The lady lamented about my mother , the lady said , this girl 's mother was a good friend to me , let me take her into my home and she took me in ; they carried me away because I was unable to walk , she took me to her home , it was a drivers home ; Her husband was Kayishema Clement 's driver , you all know his stories from Kibuye , he had to be driven by a very important person . His wife put me in the house where I stayed ; I spent about two weeks because I was wounded , she was treating my wounds . I had wounds all over and that made me very weak . Some wounds , especially on my legs had become infected . <EOS>
My ribs hurt very badly and pus oozed out but the infection on the legs was even worse , I was yellow because I had lost a lot of blood ; I had a little blood left in my body , she got scared , she said , what shall I do if she dies in my house ? She then decided to tell her husband about me , it had been a long time , I am not sure but I think it was the very first time , all I know is that he came to see me and found I was swollen all over , he told me he would take me to see a doctor the following day , I was in so much pain , I was unable to sleep ; I was unable to sit up , I was in so much pain , <EOS>
I agreed to go to the doctor the following day ; I was taken to see a doctor . I was taken to Kibuye Hospital , in the pediatric department , I was going to be treated , when we got there he asked for me to be admitted ; Admit this child he said ; He asked them to allocate me a bed , they also gave me a blanket , those given by the hospital , he then said , If anyone kills this child , I will kill them and their off springs myself . <EOS>
He also told the head of the pediatric ward that when he returns he should not find me missing from the hospital . He then left , that 's the last I saw of him , honestly , he had been so good to me , he kept me from killers because they were scared of him . They were unable to kill me , I stayed in the hospital but got no treatment , they could have treated me if they wanted ; I stayed in the hospital and the infected wounds that I had caused a lot of pain , there was a man named Bahutu Pierre , he still works in Kibuye , he was one of the workers in Kibuye , he took me and "@ stole @" me away from that part of the Hospital , he cleaned my wounds and tried to clear the infections by dressing the wounds with cotton . He recently told me that he would take me into the operations room in the middle of the night , because that is where he worked , to treat me and a certain other girl called Esther , she was also from Kibuye . My leg was flexed and I could not stretch it out because I was not getting any treatment ; Esther also had the same problem , she could not stretch out her arm . <EOS>
As you realize he tried to help me as much as he could , we stayed in the hospital , it 's the place ; It 's where I saw the worst happen ; It 's where I saw the things that will always remind me of the genocide , even when I fall sick , I still fear going to see a doctor in a hospital because if I get admitted it would remind me of the genocide because of the things I saw there ; many members of my family were still alive , you see it had been from April to May , It was in May when many members of my family died trying to visit me because they saw me as only a child who had lost a whole family ; A child who had been hacked in her hiding place , there was a man named Twayigira , he was my mother 's brother , some people had managed to hide him and assured him that he would be safe <EOS>
When he heard about me , he said ; Would n't it be stupid not to try to find her ? They tried to tell him that they would find me for him but he insisted on coming out . He then left the place . He should have had his wedding in July 94 , he left his hiding place and came rushing to find me . He reached me about seven o'clock one evening ; When I saw him , I felt overcome with grief and I felt like crying , I kept myself from crying because I did n't want them to see me cry , when he greeted me I almost broke down and cried , I replied his greeting , he had a lot of money because he was preparing for his wedding ; you see , he still had all the money , his fiancé had already been killed , he took his wallet out of his pocket ; I am not sure he was going to give me some money but as he took out his wallet , an Interahamwe named Bizuru quickly came up to him he was carrying a machete , he then led him down towards the pediatric ward , those who know a little history about Kibuye know about a very large pit they called Onapo , just behind the windows of where we were living <EOS>
It is where many Tutsi from that neighborhood who came to the hospital were killed , you see many were injured so many came to the hospital ; they took Twayigira and started to hack him , I could hear his screams , he screamed until he died , Pascal had been killed ; Pascal had a younger brother called Bosco ; Bosco is still alive , he lives in Kacyiru . They also told him that Fille is still alive although she was hacked by machetes , at that time it was the kind of news that travelled ; Let me go and see that child he said , he came with Pascal 's fiancé called Christine , they came together , she was butchered in that hole ; Then came another uncle 's wife , his name was Pascal , his wife had given birth in a hole where she was hiding . They told her that Fille was still alive , she also came asking , how is that child ? She like many others was also killed in that place , at that time it still was n't important to be one family <EOS>
We all had something in common , everyone felt responsible and wanted to come and visit and many people were killed by an Interahamwe leader called Mahundaza , I remember him ; Mahundaza also had his leader called Benoit , they used to come together . There was also the headmaster of Gatwaro school . My mother was well loved and many people said she was a social person , I did not get a chance to know her well ; many people came to visit me ; one lady came wearing a skirt and blouse that was given to her by my mother . Another girl , her father 's name was Gisunzu , there was also a second girl who had clothes given to her by my mother , and she was also killed there . <EOS>
It was also another form of torture , they would come and say to me , "@ We killed Aime , we stripped her naked and paraded her through the Round @-@ About . They also killed an eight year old girl and they bragged about it , today they deny it but in the past they were talking about it even when no one asked . They said they took the pastor 's wife naked from church and paraded her through the Round @-@ About , your relative Masamaza , they said , has been crucified at the Round @-@ About . Many told me how others had been killed , they said Butati had been killed and many things about Rutabingwa . The voices are not clear , they said that Sankara ; Thomas had resurrected to see his relatives but they had killed him too , together with Masamaza . They told me many things ; they told me how they killed many people . <EOS>
Honestly , I thought only Esther and I had survived and life became unbearable and it became worse than even during the genocide , another thing , that Interahamwe named Bizuru is that one who killed most of these people who came to visit us from nearby ; Bizuru who killed them also tortured us ; he used to cut us with razorblades , hit our feet with a hammer . Those small hammers were used on us on specific days , that is one thing that hurt most during the genocide , if only people were to be killed without being mocked and tortured ; they always gave us dates to die , if I remember well , they once said , today is the 19th , on the 20th no more Tutsi 's will be living <EOS>
We always waited for the dates when we were supposed to be killed but the Interahamwe would come and say , we will kill you the day after tomorrow , then one day they came and ordered us out to be killed , I was so weak and I was unable to move , Esther was also very weak and so we were unable to walk to our place of slaughter so they promised to come and kill us later <EOS>
After some time of waiting , there was this lady with a sick child , her name was mama Patrick , I have n't seen her since the genocide ended , and we asked about her but received no information . She gave the Interahamwe one thousand francs , I remember she put rosaries around our necks and prayed for us , she told us not to worry , nothing would happen to us and even if we were killed , we would go to heaven , there was nothing else to do , we agreed ; The Interahamwe took the one thousand at that time and left promising to return and kill us the following day ; We continued staying in the hospital ; Some people came to mock us , they said do n't bother killing her , her infections will , that is the life we were living in the hospital when the French soldiers came and stayed , after sometime they started taking people , the Interahamwe started to flee while they looted the hospital <EOS>
They took us outside , they carried us outside ; outside the hospital the UNAMIR also started taking people , they also took Esther from that place , I was also later taken , they took us in N.T ; They transported us in N.T ; They received us and tried to give us treatment but it was difficult , if you had been hacked on the lower arm , they usually amputated through the elbow , that is how it was . <EOS>
The auntie that I had lived with earlier had also come to the N.T ; she tried to follow @-@ up with the treatment but they asked her to leave it to them ; She asked them to let her take me to Congo and see if some of my relatives can help me . They tried to treat me . I would like to talk about the time at the hospital again , there was once an old lady who came running after they had discovered her hiding place , I do n't know where she came from , she came running and hid under one of the beds , she was very scared , she had a rosary and was saying her prayers . The Interahamwe came and took her . I will always remember that lady , I always remember her when I remember the genocide period . <EOS>
After leaving the hospital for N.T ; when we moved to Congo , I met my relative , there was an auntie working in Bukavu , she was studying at Istem , she learnt I was still alive , we usually gave out our names and other details . She came and started helping me get treated but with a lot of difficulty ; If she had no medical knowledge I do n't think I would have been able to walk . She taught me a lot , I first learnt how to stand like an infant , then I had a wheelchair and later with improvement I was able to use crutches . I then stayed there <EOS>
Until the point I left Bukavu ; But there are a lot of things that happened there ; you understand ; The auntie who was helping me was called Murebwayire Sheriza , most people only knew the name Sheriza , later people realized she was Rwandan , There were very many Interahamwe that I used to meet and they wanted to know where I live so they can come and kill me . I met Interahamwe from Kibuye where I lived and they always asked , Fille , where do you live ? My auntie ordered me to stop speaking Kinyarwanda ; I did n't know any other language although I slowly started to learn Swahili and tried to speak . I used to have very many operations and when I was under anesthesia , I always spoke Kinyarwanda and I also spoke about the genocide . I always remember that when I remember the genocide . <EOS>
We later left Bukavu , I really wanted to see Rwanda , I really wanted to see how my home was . My auntie remained in Bukavu and I returned with the family of my mother 's brother . She remained behind because of some things she had n't finished and was later to return to Rwanda . She was then attacked by some people who knew her as my relative ; they attacked her and tried to kill her , but a white colleague who worked with the saved her . This white person , I do n't remember his name had been my doctor . She then moved to Europe in a country called Norway , she had a school going child , she moved with that child . I stayed with my uncle 's family <EOS>
Recently , in the year two thousand ; the year two thousand and two , she died ; she was n't ill , it was a sudden death , she left work , went to bed and died , that pushed me back a lot , to be honest about life ; about the experiences I lived through the genocide . I do n't know how to rank those experiences that remind me of the genocide , they are just so many . I will never forget <EOS>
You told us about your mother , you also talked about your brother , you did n't tell us about your father or any other siblings <EOS>
They went North towards Bisesero , we did n't meet from that point <EOS>
So you never managed to know how they died or the way they were killed ? <EOS>
Killing squads would attack from here and there ... as you know some came from Gikongoro , from ... it 's just that we stayed together with those people until the last minute . <EOS>
How your mother was killed in your presence or how your brother was killed in your presence , how do you feel when you remember those experiences ? <EOS>
In the beginning it was very difficult , I felt a lot of pain ; Even when I had other kinds of problems , they always brought up the memories of my mother 's suffering and I wished she was still alive . It is understandable to hurt when your parent suffers and her life is taken . The pain you feel is understandable <EOS>
You were quite young during the genocide , eight years old , is there anything you remember about life before the war , you and your family at home ; the genocide later came and claimed the lives of your family members and parents , can you tell us the fondest memories of your mother ? <EOS>
I have very many memories of my mother ; I was the only girl in the family and she use to tell me ; when a family has only one girl and she grows up into a foolish person that 's a terrible thing to happen , so I grew up with that in mind , not to grow up into a foolish person , she also told me that a girl is like milk , she can not be tasted , I heard those things as a child but up to today I still follow those principles ; She always wished to see me study and get into secondary school and finish , I always wanted to study at least until I finish secondary school and I was able to do it . <EOS>
I can not stop studying until I have attained at least ; at least a degree , she had high hopes in me , she hoped I would grow up to become someone ; a Rwanda girl who is the pride of her mother , as her single girl child , and about the genocide we were able to share her last suffering and when I think of that , it gives me strength to keep fighting to live again . <EOS>
Can you recognize any of the people who were involved in the murder of your mother and brother ? <EOS>
As I had already said , it was sunset and I was n't able to see clearly and it was out of our neighborhood ; there is one person I know though ; I remember him , he even told me that I should pay him back if I can , it was the guard named Francois Sinzabakira <EOS>
