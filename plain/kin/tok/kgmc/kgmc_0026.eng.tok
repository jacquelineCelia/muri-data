Testimonies related to the crime of rape are not given in public . <EOS>
Any witness ... <EOS>
Let 's try to restore the society . <EOS>
This restores Rwandan society in some way . <EOS>
In order to achieve this , Gacaca courts have been established as a strategy . <EOS>
In Gacaca courts each and every Rwandan is required to tell the truth <EOS>
about the genocide , what he saw , his own contribution and what he has heard of it <EOS>
in order to lean on this and restore the Rwandan society , <EOS>
and restore it bearing in mind that genocide was planned , <EOS>
investigating on its implementation , perpetrators , <EOS>
as well as its damages , so that this may serve as a foundation <EOS>
and then give us courage to really restore the society <EOS>
in reconciling Rwandans , the tripartite people <EOS>
so that they may live in good relations again , so that they may live together again being aware of what had broken them up . <EOS>
It is within this context that we always gather here all <EOS>
in order to remind each other what happened all over Rwanda <EOS>
especially in Rugenge sector . <EOS>
Rugenge was one of the sectors of the district . <EOS>
we find here Sainte Famille parish . As you know it well , <EOS>
during the genocide , Rwandans often went to hide in places where they used to go to pray God <EOS>
thinking they would find the very God who used to help them . However it was not the case ; most of time they were killed there . <EOS>
Those places are catholic churches and others . <EOS>
Particularly , many people died in Sainte Famille . <EOS>
As you will be realizing , it remains even unknown to some that people who died in the church . <EOS>
They had come to hide ; others joined them and went to the church courtyard . <EOS>
Some who went out were killed and others were thrown grenades at . <EOS>
Some were picked one after another and killed . I hope by today we will listen to <EOS>
Our testimonies or one of Major General Munyakazi Laurent <EOS>
As a someone who was living in Kigali , as an authority , as a person who <EOS>
Followed the events , heard , saw what was being done in this city of <EOS>
Kigali . The most important thing we want to know is <EOS>
The information about what happened what will help us know what I was just saying above <EOS>
And lead us to reconciliation and rebuilding of our nation . <EOS>
Normally we want this information to be delivered in its full truth . <EOS>
There are three things @: what one did , heard and saw . <EOS>
Among people present , there are eyewitnesses and those who just heard of things . <EOS>
Rwandans here present are looking forward to making known the truth and making it available to the public <EOS>
So that we may build our nation with truth as a foundation . <EOS>
Ladies and gentlemen , the members of gacaca court panel in front of you make up the sector Court . <EOS>
As it has been said , it is made up of eighty @-@ one gacaca court members <EOS>
From seven cells , the sector court and the court of appeal . That is nine times <EOS>

They are good at law and penalties as well as all other related issues . <EOS>
As it has just been said , today is not scheduled for trial proceeding ; <EOS>
We will be listening to testimonies . This aims at allowing a person who may have heard of something <EOS>
and intends to provide some addition to the witness ' s information or ask for some clarifications . <EOS>
The cession will be chaired by the presiding judge of the court in front of us . <EOS>
In his power and wisdom , I would like to go over to him <EOS>
And ask him to chair the cession as empowered by the law . <EOS>

To provide us with good and full information that will help restore our nation <EOS>
And take it from the chaos it was plunged into . Thank you ! <EOS>

Article 38 in relation to rape ; <EOS>
The raped person chooses among the members of the gacaca court Panel . <EOS>
As it has been demonstrated ; Major general Munyakazi , in the time , I think <EOS>
He was still Major ; was in charge of the gendarmerie at Sainte @-@ Famille . Rutabana in question <EOS>
Is one of the people who escaped fights at Gisozi . He and his colleagues came <EOS>
And formed a fighter group at Sainte @-@ Famille . They had guns . Of course they were not trained . <EOS>
They had guns . They arrested some people and killed others . <EOS>
Those people are those who were escaping to Sainte @-@ Famille church . so , we want him <EOS>
To explain to us his relationship with Rutabana , how the two groups <EOS>
Were established at Sainte @-@ Famille , how people were killed . <EOS>
That is the reason why we have called him as a witness . <EOS>
We have not called him for trial . <EOS>
Unfortunately , he received the invitation belatedly whereas he himself had asked <EOS>
To share with us some experiences at the level of Nyarugenge district . Now , we may go over to him . <EOS>
In case he is needed somewhere else such as in cells , such institutions will invite him <EOS>
on their own . Without delaying , we go over to him . <EOS>
Before he starts talking , we remind that he talk of three things @: what he did himself , <EOS>
What he saw as it has been explained above and what he heard . <EOS>
The floor is his . He should start by what he did . <EOS>

So that we may take notes <EOS>
I wanted to give my testimony to gacaca court in March . <EOS>
Meanwhile , on 13th and 18th , the government of Rwanda <EOS>
Sent me to Addis @-@ Ababa in a mission so that could not be available . <EOS>
In March from 4th to the 9th I was sent <EOS>
To Mombasa in mission as well . I could not be available for the whole week . <EOS>
From the tenth to the sixteenth , I was sent <EOS>
Luanda in Angola in a mission too . From Luanda , on my own initiative , <EOS>
I went to see the mayor of Nyarugenge district . <EOS>
I asked him to give my testimony because it is my right as a Rwandan . <EOS>
He first gave me the appointment of April , 30th 2005 . <EOS>
I would give my testimony on this day of community work <EOS>
On the seventh May I talked to him in person <EOS>
He is here himself . I had not received any summon from the tribunal . I personally took the initiative <EOS>
That is why on the sixth <EOS>
May , he wrote a letter to me after having considering <EOS>
one I had written to him , asking me to come today for my testimony <EOS>
As a Rwandan . In this testimony I would like to tell you <EOS>
in brief what I did between the first October 1990 <EOS>
And the thirty @- first December 1994 <EOS>
In July 1990 I was studying in Belgium in the Ecole de Guerre <EOS>
I came back in July and I was appointed to the President of central record keeping <EOS>
Of the national gendarmerie . In August 1st , <EOS>
As you already know , the Rwanda Liberation War broke off . On 23rd , 24th , <EOS>
and 29th march 1991 the NSELE agreement was signed <EOS>
From April to September 1991 <EOS>
I joined GOMMU chaired by the General BITA from Tanzania <EOS>
From September 1991 to 1992 I was still in GOMMU <EOS>
I stayed in GOMMU chaired at the time by a colonel from Zaire <EOS>
I stayed in GOMMU but because of the conflict between Rwanda <EOS>
and Burundi . The war was likely to take place from January to April 1992 . <EOS>
In 1992 I was appointed to CPGL Security standing <EOS>
Grouping officers from Rwanda , Burundi and Zaire in order to study the resolution of the conflict . <EOS>
From April 1992 to August <EOS>
Not only I stayed in both the commission and GOMMU but also <EOS>
I went to staff headquarters from time to time in the third office where I worked . <EOS>
As you know , in July the Arusha agreement was signed . <EOS>
On August 30th 1993 <EOS>
I joined GOMMU one and GOMMU two chaired by <EOS>
General Oparelle from Nigeria . From November 1993 <EOS>
To the fourth 1994 <EOS>
I was in charge of Camp Muhima and the commander of the mobile group that operated in Camp Muhima <EOS>
Called in the time Kigali Mobile group <EOS>
On the 4th July 1994 , I left the city and exiled to <EOS>
Congo , Zaire in Southern Kivu where . I was living in Bukavu Boronge refugee camp . <EOS>
I came back to Rwanda on February 28th <EOS>
1995 <EOS>
The testimony I want to give you concerns <EOS>
What I saw and heard all along my carrier <EOS>
And travels <EOS>
Try to be slow in your speech <EOS>
The first thing I want to highlight is that <EOS>
genocide started in 1959 and kept being planned and executed by the government of Rwanda . <EOS>
I mean the governments of Rwanda during the time of MDR PARMEHUTU and MRND . <EOS>
I will show how the genocide of Tutsis was planned and executed <EOS>
From October 1st , 1990 <EOS>
To the 4th 1994 <EOS>
By the successive governments of Rwanda . <EOS>
Here is the succession of those governments @: <EOS>
From the first October 1990 to November 1991 <EOS>
The President of the Republic was Habyarimana Juvenal <EOS>
The government was made by of ministers who were all from MRND . <EOS>
From December 1991 to April 1992 , <EOS>
The president was still Habyarimana Juvenal , the then government headed by <EOS>
Nsanzimana was made of MRND and PDC . <EOS>
From April 1992 to July 1994 , <EOS>
The president was Habyarimana Juvenal and the government headed by Nsengiyaremye <EOS>
Was made of MRND , MDR , PL , PCD , and PDC . <EOS>
From 1994 to April sixth 1994 , <EOS>
The president was Habyarimana juvenal and the government headed by Uwiringiyimana <EOS>
Was made of MRND , MDR , PL PSD and PDC . <EOS>
From 6th 1994 to July 4th 1994 , <EOS>
The president was Sindikubwabo , and the government was headed by Kambanda . <EOS>
I also want to show you that after the government exiled , it kept on <EOS>
Attacking Rwanda in order to resume genocide from where it stayed in the time . <EOS>
I also want to show you strategies used to make possible these killings in Rwanda . I will show as well , in my testimony , that the killings that started on April 6th had been planned . <EOS>
As you may have just realized it , I saw all of that all along different services I was involved in . This is what I am about to tell you right now . <EOS>
Tutsis were killed during thirty @-@ five years @: <EOS>
From 1959 to 1994 . <EOS>
The period going from 1959 to July 1st 1962 @: <EOS>
During the period going from 1959 to July 1st 1962 the genocide of Tutsis was carried out by MDR PARMEHUTU , APROSOMA using Hutus so far considered as the Majority . <EOS>
The then policy aimed at chasing Tutsis out of the country and exterminating them . The genocide of Tutsis started in 1959 . <EOS>
Many books show that the killings started in the very period . <EOS>
Yes , the genocide took place but neither the UN nor foreign countries took appropriate measures to punish the perpetrators in that time . <EOS>
During the period going from July 1st 1962 to October 1st 1990 the genocide was carried out by the government of Rwanda with MDR PARMEHUTU AND MRND . The Government established the policies briefly detailed as follows @: <EOS>
It established the politics of exclusion aiming at chasing Tutsis out of the country in 1962 , 1963 , and 1973 . <EOS>
In 1982 , the then government of Rwanda refused the repatriation of Rwandan refugees living in Uganda . The government of Rwanda raised troops at the boarder in order to shoot at refugees intending to come back . This is real . <EOS>
In 1986 , the government of Rwanda asked Uganda to take back to Uganda refugees that had settled in Mutara and Nansho . This was in line with the politics of exclusion . <EOS>
This was implemented in schools , work places , public services , and the army ; everywhere the policy of extermination . Rwanda experienced this in 1962 , 1963 , 1967 and 1973 . <EOS>
The genocide of Tutsis took place but neither the UN nor foreign countries took appropriate measures to prosecute those who carried it out . <EOS>
Please sir , we would like to ask you the copy of what you are telling us and start precisely from 1994 on April 7th to the 31st 1994 . <EOS>
Please , I beg you not to muddle up my message ! I need to be calm because there is a logical sequence of events in it . This is just an introduction . I am soon starting October 1st 1990 . I only still have two lines . <EOS>
I think you are getting my point @: I must provide explanations about the period going from October 1st 1990 to 31st and I have to introduce it . <EOS>
I would like to go on , if you allow it , without dropping out this introduction . <EOS>
We need to work together so to follow our programme <EOS>
We have told you three things to talk about @: what you did , what you saw and what you heard . You will start by what you did . If there is not tell us there is n't or you will ... <EOS>
From 1959 , the government favored killers of Tutsis . in other words , it enthroned impunity toward any who kills a Tutsi in Rwanda . The government of Rwanda and MRND , the then leading party , refused the repatriation of refugees . <EOS>
Since they knew that those refugees were going to come back by force , they started blacklisting Tutsis so to exterminate them . <EOS>
The genocide of Tutsis had been planned and was perpetrated since October 1st 1990 till October 31st 1994 . <EOS>
As you 've just asked me to , I am now going to tell you what I saw and heard , in the following lines . I mean the three points you asked me to develop . <EOS>
The government of Rwanda in power since 1st 1990 till December 1991 <EOS>
had Major General Habyarimana Juvenal as the president of the republic and ministers from MRND as it had been for many successive governments by the way . The genocide of Tutsis started on October 1st 1990 . <EOS>
The extermination of Tutsis started being put into practice on October 1st 1990 <EOS>
The government of Rwanda and MRND , the then leading party , started killing Tutsis in Rwanda because every Rwandan and all leaders at all levels adhered to MRND hence had to execute the orders from the MRND central committee and its President . <EOS>
On October 1st 1990 , the strategy of bringing fake accusations against Tutsis started being used by the government of Rwanda and MRND who faked the charge of betrayal against Tutsis so that Hutus might exterminate them in very short time under pretext that Tutsis who were in Rwanda collaborated with Inyenzi hence had to be arrested and killed . <EOS>
Tutsis were wrongfully accused of keeping guns and bullets to kill hutus all over Rwanda . They were wrongfully accused of keeping Inyenzi 's guns and bullets and having transmitting and receiving sets to communicate with Inyenzi . All this intended to arresting and killing them . it was said that , in their murderous operations , Tutsis had identity cards model IV drawn and printed in Sisi Evariste 's printing house <EOS>
So that Inyenzi might kill hutus who had identity cards model III . Tutsis were also wrongfully accused of having dug graves in their houses in which to bury Hutus after killing them . <EOS>
The government of Rwanda invented a story according to which Inyenzi alongside their accomplices had left Uganda to invade Kigali during the night the 4th and the 6th October 1990 . <EOS>
Within the context of this scenario , soldiers and gendarmes from Kanombe , Kacyiru , Kami and Kigali military camps were ordered by the army staff and the gendarmerie to shoot in the air all the night . I saw this myself because I told you I was here in the city <EOS>
The government of Rwanda headed by Habyarimana lied to Rwandans and foreign countries that the Rwandan army had just beaten Inyenzi and their accomplices having invaded Kigali and that the invaders had been caught with their guns and many bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets . It added that in case one needed proofs would go to see them at Gikondo police station . <EOS>
The president of the republic Habyarimana Juvenal ordered to arrest Tutsis who were in Rwanda whom he called accomplices of Inyenzi as well as Hutus presumed to be in connection with Inyenzi who invaded Rwanda . <EOS>
In Kigali , the arrested people were taken to Nyamirambo stadium and had to be killed in the shortest future because they had been called the enemies of the whole country . Here is the high @-@ ranking staff of FAR ( Forces Armées Rwandaises ) [ Rwanda Army Forces ] similar to one of the unities in Kigali . <EOS>
In the president 's office , the president was Habyarimana whose private secretary was Sagatwa . In the Military intelligence , there were such people as Nuwayezu and Simbikangwa . <EOS>
The commander of the Republican Guard was lieutenant @-@ colonel Nkundiye . All of them were from Gisenyi . <EOS>
G3 @: Lieutenant @-@ colonel Rwabarinda and G4 Major Ngirumpatse . <EOS>
The gendarmerie staff was headed by the gendarmerie chief @-@ staff and army chief @-@ staff Habyarimana , the MRND President . The gendarmerie deputy chief @-@ staff was Colonel Rwagafirita who was also the president of the central committee . G1 @: colonel Ngayinteranya , G2 @: Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Rutayisire , J3 @: Colonel Hakizimana and G4 @: Major Nsanzimfura . <EOS>
Here are unities operating in Kigali @: the commander of Kanombe military camp was Colonel Bagosora , battalion commander was major Ntabakuze , junior battalion commander was Major Ntibihora , the ordnance commander was Mutabera , Colonel Bagosora , base commander was Major Nubaha and the head of health department was Lieutenant @-@ colonel Baransabitse . <EOS>
ESM ( Ecole Supérieure Militaire ) [ Senior Military Academy ) : the director was Colonel Buregeya ; the air force department was headed by Colonel Ntahobari ; in Kami military Camp there was Bararwerekana ; in Kigali military camp , Major Ntizigirwa whereas Kacyiru military camp was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel Nyuragabo and the mobile group by Major Rwarakabije . <EOS>
Kigali formation commander was Major General Nturagabo ; technician commander was colonel Biganiro whereas the commander general was Captain Ndayisaba ; traffic security commander was Nzabonimpa and I , Major Munyakazi , was the central chief record @-@ keeper . <EOS>
It is clear to one 's eyes that all unities were commanded by people from Gisenyi or Ruhengeri . In addition , the very unities arrested people , arrested Tutsis and Hutus and took them to the stadium within the context of the operation ordered by the national army staff . <EOS>
In October 1990 , colonel Rwagafirita who was a member of MRND central committee and gendarmerie deputy chief staff always said that all Tutsis living in Rwanda had to be killed because they were the enemies of the country and accomplices of Inyenzi . <EOS>
According to them , all Tutsis had to be arrested and killed in the shortest future without any trial . He always said that and it was realized that he told it French confirming that Tutsis were in small number , that they would easily be killed . He said it in the parliamentary report submitted to General Jean Valle who was in charge of the French Military Commission . <EOS>
He [ General Jean Valle ] also told the commission that he had known this from Rwagafirita himself . <EOS>
In October 1990 , colonel Serubuga who was a member of the central committee and Rwandan army chief staff said that he had just found the alibi to kill all Tutsis on October 1st all over Rwanda . He always said that , confirming that Tutsis were the enemies of the country . He even said it to French in his own words that Tutsis would all die . <EOS>
It is clearly stated in the parliamentary commission report that the then ambassador to Rwanda said that he had been told those words by colonel Serubuga . Clearly both colonel Serubuga and colonel Rwagafirita who commanded the army and gendarmerie headquarters had already told French that Tutsis would be killed . <EOS>
Even in October 1990 the then defense attaché colonel Réné Darny wrote in his report that seven hundred thousand Tutsis would die in Rwanda in such a way that the issue was raised in the French parliamentary report . <EOS>
The reason why people were not exterminated in 1990 as it had been planned is that other countries and embassies put pressure on Habyarimana and obliged him to release people showing that they were innocent . <EOS>
When they went to Gikondo police station , they realized that the guns , transmitting and receiving sets were just a story invented to put fake accusations on Tutsis . <EOS>
A clearing commission chaired by the prosecutor general Nkubito discovered that there were neither guns nor bullets found in Tutsis ' houses in the whole country . The commission found out that there was no model IV of the identity card discovered in Tutsis . It also found out that there were no graves dug in houses and fields of Tutsis , which graves , as said , Tutsis would bury hutus in . <EOS>
As you have said that one has to say what he knows or heard , MRND maintained this policy up to April , May and June . They did not change at all . <EOS>
That is why I wanted to deeply explain this problem in order to make you understand well . <EOS>
During all this time , that government carried out genocide of Tutsis . It carried out the genocide of Tutsis in October 1990 in Mutara and Byumba . It carried out the genocide of Tutsis in January 1991 in Kibirira , Gisenyi and the genocide of Bagogwe in January 1991 in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi . <EOS>
Other countries started denouncing those killings by the government of Rwanda . However , the government of Rwanda and MRND refused the Agreement of Nsele signed on March 29th 1991 and kept planning the extermination of Tutsis in Rwanda . <EOS>
From October RPF had always denounced that genocide of Tutsis carried out by the government of Rwanda and headed by MRND for successive terms . MRND Members were present in all positions in the government of December 1991 till April 16th 1992 . <EOS>
The president of the republic was Major General Habyarimana , the prime minister was Nsanzimana and ministers were MRND members . The prime minister was from PDC . <EOS>
The government still rejected agreements and went on planning the extermination of Tutsis in Rwanda . <EOS>
The government of Rwanda kept on killing people and in March 1992 there was the genocide of Tutsis in Kibirira , Gisenyi , in Bugesera , and Kigali Ngali . <EOS>
The government formed on April 16th 1992 and reshuffled in July 1993 had Major General Habyarimana Juvenal as the president of the republic and Nsengimana as the prime minister . This government was made up of ministers from different political parties @: MRND had 9 , MDR 3 , PSD3 , PL 3 , and PDC 1 . <EOS>
The government of Rwanda still refused the agreements and kept the war logic and the extermination of Tutsis . <EOS>
As you know it , the genocide of Tutsis was carried out in June and July 1992 in Bugesera , Kigali Ngali . The genocide of Tutsis was carried out in March 1992 in Gisenyi , Kibirira and Kibuye . <EOS>
From March to June 1992 , the president of the republic Habyarimana , the government headed by Nsanzimana , and the government headed by Nsengiyaremye kept carrying out the genocide of Tutsis in Gisenyi and elsewhere in Rwanda , as I have just demonstrated it above . <EOS>
RPF asked the government of Rwanda to cease the killings and decided to stop the genocide in Rwanda . <EOS>
The government of Rwanda accepted to stop killings in Bugesera , Kigali Ngali . The government and RPF signed Arusha agreement on July 12th 1992 . <EOS>
MRND , CDR and some officers in favor of MRND were not happy about the agreement of the 10th and 30th October 1992 and 9th January 1993 concerning the power sharing in the government . They accused minister Ngurinzira from MDR of being RPF 's accomplice since he had granted to RPF the ministries before occupied by MRND . <EOS>
Those ministries were the ministry of interior , the ministry of transport , the ministry of health , and the ministry of youth . <EOS>
In January 1993 , the president Habyarimana and MRND continued the genocide of Tutsis in Kibirira and Kibuye . <EOS>
On February 4th 1993 , RPF asked the AUO [ African Union Organization ] to tell the government of Rwanda to stop the genocide of Tutsis in Gisenyi , Kibuye and all over Rwanda . it also said there was enough force to protect Rwandans who were being killed not later than three days from then <EOS>
RPF did it and on February 8th 1993 it decided to start the war intended to stop genocide all over Rwanda . <EOS>
On February 9th 1993 , RPF was about 30 km from Kigali . Other countries ordered RPF to stop the war intended to stop genocide that was taking place in Rwanda and the very countries started suggesting to RPF to withdraw . <EOS>
From February 25th to March 2nd 1993 RPF met MDR , PL , PSD , and PDC in Bujumbura and accepted the ceasefire . <EOS>
MRND refused to go to Bujumbura and continued the plan of exterminating Tutsis in Rwanda . On March 7th 1993 Dar @-@ es @-@ salaam communiqué signed between RPF and the government of Rwanda was issued . <EOS>
As you know , MRND and CDR rejected the Dar @-@ es @- Salaam communiqué and continued their project of exterminating Tutsis in Rwanda . <EOS>
The government in power from July 1993 to April 6th 1994 comprised major General Habyarimana as the president of the republic , Uwiringiyimana Agatha as the prime minister , 9 ministers from MRND , 3 from MDR , 3 from PSD , 3 from PL , and one from PDC . <EOS>
On August 4th 1993 , RPF and the government of Rwanda signed Arusha peace Agreement . After the signing of Arusha agreement , MRND and CDR continued to refuse the agreement of power sharing with RPF . During that time , MRND and CDR continued to stay away from those agreements and maintained their programme of exterminating Tutsis and rejecting agreements as well as training and equipping their militias . <EOS>
After August 4th 1993 , MRND , CDR , alongside MDR Power and PL Power , continued the programme of exterminating Tutsis . The president Habyarimana refused the establishment of the transitional government and National Assembly . <EOS>
The government would have 21 ministers and the National Assembly 71 deputies . <EOS>
The president Habyarimana was afraid that 48 of 71 deputies would make decisions and that 14 of 21 ministers would decide as well . That is why he wanted to have 1/3 plus one person . <EOS>
In the National Assembly there would be 11 deputies from MRND and other 13 of whom he thought 6 would come from MDR Power , 5 from PL Power and 2 from other parties . 5 ministers would come from MRND , 3 from MDR Power and 1 from PL Power . <EOS>
There was a very bad atmosphere among Politicians in Rwanda from July 1993 to April 6th 1994 . There was a misunderstanding in MDR and PL . MRND , CDR , and PL Power wanted the war so to beat RPF and Tutsis whom treated as accomplices in Rwanda . <EOS>
In FAR , there was a very bad atmosphere as well . There was such a misunderstanding that some were for MRND , CDR , PL Power were strongly against MDR Uwiringiyimana 's leanings , PL Lando 's leanings , and RPF supported by all Tutsis in Rwanda called RPF INKOTANYI 's accomplices <EOS>
The part of FAR on the side of MRND , CDR , PL , MDR power supported MRND 's , CDR 's , PL Power 's , and MDR Power 's militias in such a way that it supplied them in war equipment to use in the war of exterminating Tutsis in Rwanda <EOS>
Those protocols of agreement of October 10th 1992 and January 9th 1993 talked about power sharing . <EOS>
The protocol of agreement of August 3rd talked about power sharing in national army and gendarmerie . There were some soldiers who said they could not work with Tutsis and Inyenzi in the national army and gendarmerie . <EOS>
From 1960 to December 1993 , people from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri constituted the majority in FAR and occupied very important positions in all domains in FAR . They were not happy about hearing that the government headed by Agatha Uwiringiyimana would demobilize their officers due to the principle that had just been set in relation to sharing 12 positions among 11 prefectures of Rwanda . <EOS>
The government headed by Uwiringiyimana Agatha decided that each prefecture would have one place except Gisenyi that would have two . This decision caused discontent in soldiers from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri who turned against the prime minister Uwiringiyimana Agatha given that those decisions had been made at the level of every prefecture . <EOS>
Rwandan army 's Seats to transitional government were shared as follows . Rwandan army Ruhengeri @: chief staff A1 major General Nsabimaana ; Byumba @: brigadier commander Colonel Bizimungu ; Kigali city @: brigadier commander Colonel Gatsinzi ; Kibungo @: deputy Brigadier commander Lieutenant @-@ colonel Sebuhire ; Butare @: deputy brigadier commander Major Gasarabwe . <EOS>
National gendarmerie in Gikongoro @: colonel Rutayisire ; deputy chief staff in Cyangugu @: Major Bavugamenshi ; Kibuye formation commander @: lieutenant @-@ colonel Nzapfakumunsi ; Kigali formation commander @: Major Nsanzimfura ; Gitarama formation commander @: commander Ndereyimana ; Gisenyi formation commander @: Major Munyarugerero and Major Nzabonimpa had been appointed . <EOS>
From January 5th 1994 , after the president Habyarimana swore , there was a bad atmosphere in politicians and FAR soldiers . On 8th January 1994 Interahamwe of MRND , Impuzamugambi of CDR as well as other young men of MDR Power made a march in Kigali city and at CND showing their strength and that they would exterminate Tutsis who lived in Rwanda . <EOS>
From this date , militias of those political parties in all sectors of Kigali and all communes of Rwanda received guns and bullets they used during genocide which started on April 6th 1994 . <EOS>
After the death of Gatabazi in February 1993 there was genocide of Tutsis in Kigali . MINUAR was seeing that Tutsis were being killed by the government of Rwanda . <EOS>
In the government in power from June 4th 1994 to July 4th 1994 , the president was Sindikubwabo and the prime minister Kambanda . In the night of 6th to 7th April , the government of Rwanda headed by Kambanda that was composed of MRND , MDR Power , PL Power and others continued to plan and carry out the genocide of Tutsis all over Rwanda which cost more than one million lives between April and July 4th 1994 . <EOS>
The strategies that was prepared since October 1990 . On April 7th 1994 , RPF Inkotanyi decided to stop the genocide . On 4th RPF Inkotanyi stopped Rwanda 's genocide , they stopped the genocide all over Rwanda . <EOS>
Strategies used to exterminate Tutsis include blacklisting them in order to kill them . Here is the problem you usually encounter probably . I am going to tell you all of that because I have come here for that . <EOS>
Blacklisting Tutsis and bringing fake accusations against them so that they get killed by hutus , publication of ten commandments of Hutus so to make the latter hate and then kill Tutsis , convincing Hutus at all levels that any tutsi living in Rwanda or in exile is an enemy that needs killing , setting barriers in all paths even in cells all over Rwanda so to hunt every tutsi and prevent him from escaping , searching houses in order to find where Tutsis might be hiding so kill them , <EOS>
Giving out guns in the population of all communes all over Rwanda which guns were to be used in order to exterminate Tutsis , establishing militias Interahamwe of MRND and Impuzamugambi of CDR intended to kill Tutsis on the barriers and where they might be hiding , training Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi in order to invade houses of religious people of the Catholic Church , churches and schools where Tutsis might have gone for escape so kill them in a very short time . <EOS>
Convincing hutus that they are above Tutsis and that killing the latter , raping tutsi women , burning their houses , seizing their property shall not be punished in Rwanda . Blacklisting Tutsis was a strategy that started being used since 1961 and 1973 by MDR PARMEHUTU . <EOS>
The method was also used by MRND chaired by Habyarimana Juvenal on October 1st 1990 . The president 's office had an intelligence department that kept the lists of Tutsis to be caught and killed at once because Inyenzi had invaded Rwanda . <EOS>
I think I have already told you that on October 1st 1990 , the government of Rwanda used the strategy of charging Tutsis of fake accusations in order to abuse their reputation . I will repeat it because the very accusations took four years . <EOS>
Tutsis were wrongfully accused of being accomplices of Inyenzi to be killed like any other enemy , of keeping guns and bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets . as I have already showed above , the government of Rwanda invented a story whereby Inyenzi had invaded . I have already explained that the government accepted the publication and teaching of the ten commandments of hutus to the population . <EOS>
are you through ? <EOS>
No , people are making noise . You may tell them to keep quiet ! <EOS>
Please hold on ! Hold on please ! Remember the instructions we have already read . Let him finish . <EOS>
On September 21st 1992 , chief staff Nsabimaana told soldiers in the army that every tutsi living in Rwanda was an enemy . <EOS>
This ideology had already existed since 1963 and had just been put into writing by the army staff . Political parties such as MRND , CDR , MDR Power , and PL Power with their lists had convinced their members that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed . In order to locate the enemy and prevent him from escaping , barriers were set in all paths in cells of Rwanda . Houses and bushes were also searched to se where a tutsi might be hiding and kill him . <EOS>
This method was used since April 6th 1994 till July 4th 1994 and cost many lives of Tutsis in Rwanda <EOS>
Because the population in cells was ordered to settle on the barriers , be on patrol all nights looking for a Tutsi in order to kill him . This method was called self and common defense . This was just fancying other countries so that they might not denounce it but the method was actually intended to exterminating Tutsis in Rwanda since it had been put that a Tutsi is an enemy to be killed . <EOS>
Guns had also been given out since October 1st 1990 . The guns intended to exterminate Tutsis . The establishment of MRND and CDR militias was illegal as far as Rwandan law was concerned . Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi were also trained . From 1959 , Tutsis had been escaping to houses of religious people , churches and schools of the Catholic church and could survive <EOS>
Because the population feared to kill Tutsis in those houses . MRND and CDR trained Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi to attack those houses , churches and schools of the catholic Church and kill in very short time the Tutsis in . <EOS>
This method was used till July 4th . That is the reason why people who escaped there were attacked many times . Interahamwe were set to exterminate them and killed many Tutsis in those houses , churches and schools . <EOS>
Since 1959 , the governments of Rwanda had been using a big number of Hutus to kill Tutsis whom Hutus seized the property of the latter without any prosecution by the government . <EOS>
Now here is what I saw at Goma when I was exiling with FAR People though people may say that is not necessary , I am afraid ... <EOS>
April , June 1994 till July 3rd 1994 , officers who were in the army and gendarmerie staff command are the following @: in the time Bizimana was not in Rwanda . Bagosora was the principal private secretary . <EOS>
In the army staff command , there were regions . Mutara region was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel Karyabwite and Byumba region by Bizimungu replaced by lieutenant @-@ colonel Ruvugabagabo . Gisenyi region was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel Nsengiyumva whereas Rusimo was under Nkwiyekubona . Butare was commanded by Gatsinzi later replaced by Muvunyi , Gitarama by lieutenant @-@ colonel Habufite , Bugesera by Ntabakuze . Nyanza was under Gasarabwe , Cyangugu Musonera , and Kigali region was commanded by colonel Muberuka whereas Overall Command1 was under colonel Ndahimana and Command12 under Nkwiyekubona . <EOS>
In the capital Kigali , there were many unities and commanders @: one for Kimihurura military camp , one for Kigali military camp , one for Kanombe military camp , one for ESM , one for Muhima military camp , and another for Kacyiru military camp . <EOS>
Killings . Political parties such as MRND , CDR , MDR Power , PL Power and governmental administration kept conspiring in the capital Kigali . As far as the killings of Tutsis from October 1st 1990 to December 31st 1994 are concerned , the reaction was that all reports showed that those killings were carried out by the government of Rwanda together with FAR , authorities at all levels as well as a big number of the population . <EOS>
I was the head of central record @-@ keeping from October 2nd 1990 in the capital Kigali . In my duties , I drew a report to the gendarmerie chief staff and the minister of defense saying that I had not caught a single Tutsi with model IV identity card so far said to be held by all Tutsis in Rwanda , what was just an invented story . <EOS>
The second thing I did is that I drew a report saying that we found no spool neither in Sisi Evariste 's printing house at Kicukiro nor in other Tutsis accused of keeping them and giving them out in Tutsis so that Inyenzi might distinguish them from Hutus . Those accusations had been brought by the central intelligence department of the president 's office . munyakazi Munyakazi I drew a report saying that there was no gun found , illegally possessed by a single tutsi because there were Tutsis who possessed guns that they had been given by the government <EOS>
I reported that no gun stores , bullets , transmitting and receiving sets were found in Tutsis ' houses . I also went to Gikondo police station . I found out that the guns showed to be taken from Tutsis were worn and greased . They were kept in small stores of the Rwandan army . We asked gendarmes who were around . They told us that the guns had been brought by GD soldiers commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel Nsengiyumva . We met there some agents from embassies who had come to see the guns <EOS>
We also found out that the transmitters and receivers said to be taken from Inyenzi were too worn and could not work . The soldiers we met at Gikondo told us that the transmitters and receivers had been brought by GD soldiers which GD was commanded by the Lieutenant @-@ colonel . I handed in those reports to gendarmerie chief staff and the minister of defense . The same reports were submitted to the prosecutor general Lorge . <EOS>
Please , another clarification ! Did you hand the report in to Habyarimana 's regime or the current regime ? I mean ours . <EOS>
I handed it in to Habyarimana 's regime <EOS>
Is it before the war ? <EOS>
Yes , before ! I told you that it was on 4th and 6th . That is the time when we met agents from embassies , which started putting pressure on Habyarimana saying he was bringing fake accusations against Tutsis in order to have the alibi to kill them . <EOS>
I do n't know whether you are through so that we may ask you another question ! <EOS>
Not yet . I 'm still developing what you have asked me about .... <EOS>
Try to tackle questions you 've been asked @: what you did personally . <EOS>
Of course that is what I did personally ! <EOS>
That was just reports ! What would you tell us about the genocide ? Did you do anything ? <EOS>
That is what I am going to talk about . Right ! <EOS>
Hello ! Listen please ! <EOS>
On April 6th 1994 I was the commander of Muhima military camp and Kigali mobile group commander . The mobile group was a unity of the national gendarmerie in charge of protecting Radio Rwanda , Rwanda television , Rwandatel , the National bank , and MINADEF . <EOS>
I say it once again @: as the mobile group commander , my duty was to protect Radio Rwanda , Rwanda television , Rwandatel , the National bank , and MINADEF . As the commander of Muhima military camp , I had to protect Muhima military camp . <EOS>
Do I answer your question about what I did ? What I did as the mobile group commander is to give the order to gendarmes to protect Radio Rwanda , Rwanda television , Rwandatel , the National bank , and MINADEF as well as the population and religious people who were in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . <EOS>
Go on <EOS>
in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral .... <EOS>
You have just said what you did and the duties of gendarmes under your command . Now we want to know ; what was your role in all that ? You have absolutely said you did not do anything wrong . Would you explain to us ? <EOS>
In Saint @-@ Michel cathedral ... in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral ... The gendarmes under my command succeeded to protect all the people who escaped to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . I protected religious people and all others who came there . Displaced people who were at Gisimba 's were taken from Nyamirambo to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral because it was known that it was protected by gendarmes under the command of lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . <EOS>
Let him talk so to explain what we will ask him . You are allowed neither to laugh at him nor to acclaim what he says be it false or true . You shall be given the floor when need is ! <EOS>
in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral ... you know ... though I see people laughing at me ! I protected all those orphans and old people from Nyamirambo till July 4th when gendarmes exiled . They had not hurt anyone though . Gisimba himself can confirm that . <EOS>
Note father Karibushi as well . Father Karibushi who received those displaced people in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . This was in the center of my area . No single individual was attacked by the gendarmes under my command in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . You shall invite Father Karibushi . Even Gisimba can tell you that I did not hurt any of his children and old people . <EOS>
I now go to something else ; as the commander of Muhima military camp . At one time , Nyarugenge territory company came to settle next to Muhima military camp . It used to stay in the police 's place today . Though Nyarugenge territory company belonged to Kigali formation , I gave them orders . I ordered captain Nyiribambe to go and protect the people who were in Hotel de Mille Collines , in Sainte @-@ Famille church , in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral , I beg your pardon ! It is rather saint @-@ Paul centre and Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux . <EOS>
The gendarmes of the company protected Hotel de Milles Collines . They were with lieutenant @-@ colonel Mwangi of MINUAR . <EOS>
On June 27th , the army staff command displaced people who were ... Those who had stayed were displaced pretending that other activities were to be established there . It was said French would come to settle in Kigali . In that time , the territory company had no responsibilities because the hotel had just been seized by Rwanda army staff command <EOS>
On the 10th , Hotel de Milles Collines was repeatedly attacked by Interahamwe militias because it sheltered people called RPF accomplices . However , the gendarmes of the company together with the mobile group who were at Hotel de Milles Collines , as I told you , fought against Interahamwe <EOS>
On June 17th 1994 , the Interahamwe militias came in a very big number and succeeded to enter the hotel . They broke doors and started getting people down in order to kill them . I was called and I went there . I found two families that had just been taken to the reception desk to be killed . I may even tell you the families so that you may ask them yourself . <EOS>
There was the family of Murindangabo Embroise and one of Habiyakare . They all saw that I was coming for their help <EOS>
When I was at Hotel de Milles Collines on 17th , there was Father Uwimana the priest of Saint @-@ André parish who had escaped to Saint @-@ Paul center but went to Hotel de Milles Collines after . He saw me at the hotel ; I even gave orders to go for help to people who were at Saint @-@ Paul and Sainte @-@ Famille and chase Interahamwe who were going there to kill them . <EOS>
Father Uwimana told me @: "@ I can see that you still have a human heart to help people . I want to beg you one thing ; I want you to go for help to people who are at Saint @-@ Paul center who are going to get killed by Interahamwe . They are at father Vermerie 's @"@ . They were sitting down in the caves at Bishop Vermerie 's . <EOS>
I went to him and said that I did not know at Father Vermerie 's . He suggested going together so that he might lead me . I was in a pick @-@ up vehicle . We went to take priests and nuns who were there . I took all of them to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . Among the priests , there was Hakizimana Celestin who was in charge of Saint @-@ Paul center , Mwumvaneza Anaclet , Galican Ndayisaba , Sfi , Tubane and other people with him . I carried them in the pickup to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . I was with Father Uwimana . I did it two times <EOS>
Surprisingly , I read in newspapers .... Meanwhile when Inkotanyi came and took people with them , MP Rugema Donatien went among the people . On the way he came back to Saint @-@ Paul lest he should get killed . He had joined the group at Saint @-@ Paul and stayed with them . When I went there for their help , he immediately ran away and went to Sainte @-@ Famille to tell displaced people who were in that he had just escaped from death @: lieutenant @-@ colonel had taken people in a pickup and was going to kill them . <EOS>
He had been with the people in saint @-@ Paul all the day , refused to be taken with others and went to bring fake accusations against me in the church saying that I was going to kill those I had taken with me . All those people are still alive . Investigations have proven that . They are all alive . <EOS>
Because I was at Saint @-@ Michel cathedral , on 18th and 19th I was asked by priests to take Saint @-@ Vincent and Assumption sisters as well as religious brothers who were in Procure and bring them to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral so that they might stay together . I took all of them to the cathedral . Nothing bad happened to them . They are all alive , invite them ; they will tell you . I did not harm them . <EOS>
Meanwhile , the gendarmes I had transferred to Saint @-@ Paul center and Sainte @-@ Famille had another duty given to them . It had not been evoked but we have to evoke it for the moment . Displaced people comprised two parts @: there were displaced people who were for the government outside the church , to the primary school and to JOC . These ones could walk without any problem . There were others who were hiding in the church and Saint @-@ Paul center who could not have neither food nor water . <EOS>
Father Hakizimana , praised for having helped a lot displaced people , together with Father Galican as well as other priests they were together , told me the problem . They said that they sheltered displaced people but did not have means to get water and food . There were Interahamwe there and they could not leave so to bring food from CARITAS stock at Nyamirambo , Saint @-@ André and ... the place where the Church built a very big house <EOS>
They asked me to give them gendarmes to help them get food for displaced people . I accepted that gendarmes at saint @-@ Paul center and Sainte @-@ Famille went to fetch water for the displaced people . They even went to bring food for them . Even though these things are not often evoked the priests who were there may tell you that the gendarmes did that work . <EOS>
Something else I did as far as helping people is concerned is running a secret operation with Father Hakizimana . In our secret operation , we were well @-@ suited that the food would be taken from Sainte @-@ Famille stock and sent to King Faycal Hospital and Hotel Méridien through Red Cross because there was no food . We wanted to secretly take the food from CARITAS stocks at Nyamirambo and bring it in the area controlled by RPF . We would proceed like that . We did it exactly that way . <EOS>
Priests who present , that is the secret . You have been asking what we did . I , lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi , accepted to send in a deep secret the food eaten by people in King Faycal , in Hotel Méridien . Even my seniors asked me about that and I denied it because it was a very deep secret . You can see that I was a good @-@ hearted man ; I did not even want people to starve <EOS>
Do you think you are through ? Have you said that the mobile group at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul ... <EOS>
I ordered Captain Ntirugiribambe <EOS>
Do you mean you set them to protect people who had escaped to the church ? <EOS>
Definitely ! <EOS>
Was n't it that way ? <EOS>
I gave orders <EOS>
Alright ! Before that , I want to start by the reason why we had invited you though you did not get the invitation .... <EOS>
I did not get it <EOS>
We want to know your relationship with ... As you explained , there were two groups at Sainte @-@ Famille . One of gendarmes of course under your command , and another of the population who were armed . Was n't it that way ? Did you explain it that way ? You had the responsibility to protect people as you said . How come that there were armed people killing others who were running away because of their ethnic group ? I think you all know that . You have also explained it . <EOS>
Before we get deep into the matter , we would like to ask you about rumors about you so that you may say something about it as well . Would you say something about your relationship with armed people who had escaped from fights at Gisozi ? These people set barriers in roads and arrested people who went to Sainte @-@ Famille in order to kill them . How can you explain it given that your protection did not save lives since all people who were at Sainte @-@ Famille died ? You shall explain to us the above relationship and tell us the importance of your gendarmes considering that people died every single day . <EOS>
I am afraid you have not understood me well ! I told you that I commanded the mobile group . I also told you that the mobile group watched over Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . Do you get me ? I told you there was no problem at Saint @-@ Michel Cathedral . <EOS>
Then as the commander of Muhima military camp , I ordered the territory company that was there , to settle at Hotel de Mille Collines , Sainte @-@ Famille church , Saint @-@ Paul center , and Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux in order to protect the population . Personally I did not have any connection with the Interahamwe . <EOS>
Explain it well till we really understand . Why were those Interahamwe armed ? It was among your duties to protect people so that they might not be killed . Where did those people get guns from if you were not connected with them ? <EOS>
I told you that the gendarmes protected the population there . Whether gendarmes went there from time to time , whether they were connected with them , Captain Ntirugiribambe may explain it to you better . I ensure you that I had no connection with the Interahamwe who attacked Sainte @-@ Famille church and Saint @-@ Paul center . <EOS>
Do you accept that many people died at saint @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul Sir ? <EOS>
Of course ! I do know that people died there <EOS>
So , the task you had given to your gendarmes was to protect who exactly ? <EOS>
The population , yes I know ! <EOS>
Which population ? <EOS>
One that had escaped there <EOS>
In the church and at Saint @-@ Paul center ? Isn ’ it ? <EOS>
Yes , it is . <EOS>
So , why were they dying every single day ? It is clear in many reports and many people who had escaped there say it . How can you really explain that ? It is not clear ! <EOS>
Tell me first what those reports are so that I may have the idea of those accusations brought against me as you are saying . <EOS>
I just wanted to explain to you so to have the same understanding of things . This is not a trial . It is just information collection <EOS>
You have just said yourself that this is not a trial ! On June 17th , I read in newspapers that I headed the Interahamwe 's attack to Sainte @-@ Famille . It is impossible @: at that time , RPF had carried out an operation and took people from Saint @-@ Paul . The Interahamwe became angry and decided to attack all institutions . They attacked Hotel de Mille Collines , Sainte @-@ Famille church and tried even to attack Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . <EOS>
As a commander , I already told you what I did . I was told that the doors of Hotel de Mille Collines had just been broken and that people had already been taken up to the reception desk . This was my reaction @: I quickly ran from Muhima military camp to Hotel de Mille Collines . I immediately brought the Interahamwe 's attack to heel and the very gendarmes chased the Interahamwe who were taking people from Sainte @-@ Famille church and making them enter the Procure . <EOS>
You can see well that saying I headed the attack is pure lies because I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . Here are even people who saw me . I can see them here . There is Uwimana and others . I was not part of that attack ; I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . <EOS>
We would like to ask you a question Sir ! Still about Saint @-@ Michel , can you really confirm that no single individual died there ? I know one who died there . His name was Semuhungu . He worked in the National Bank ... I mean Banque de Kigali . I think he first worked in Banque de Kigali and shifted to the National Bank after . The man died there . <EOS>
Okay , let 's just forget about that one . Let 's come back to the issue of Sainte @-@ Famille . You have just confirmed that you saved people who were in Saint @-@ Michel and Hotel de Mille Collines because the gendarmes could protect them . Why did n't the gendarmes protect Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul center and let such people die ? Talk about that that very minor issue then we give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . <EOS>
I told you that the gendarmes I sent to Mille Collinnes , Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul belonged to the Nyarugenge territory company of Kigali formation . <EOS>
Who was in charge of them ? <EOS>
They had the formation commander who was in charge of them . it was a unity under the command of the army staff . I told them to go and protect the population in the places I mentioned . The unity under my command in the capital was the mobile group . You should only ask me about Saint @-@ Michel cathedral because it was in my area . <EOS>
Do you mean that protecting Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul were not within your duties ? <EOS>
They were under Nyarugenge territory company of Kigali formation <EOS>
Who was the responsible ? <EOS>
Each formation had its own commander <EOS>
What was his name ? <EOS>
His name was lieutenant @-@ colonel Kanimba . He was there temporarily but he normally belonged to Kacyiru military camp <EOS>
What about what you said that you once arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul ? <EOS>
Of course I did <EOS>
You said you were going to save people the priest had recommended . And who else ? <EOS>
On June 17th ... <EOS>
Did n't you realize anything strange ? <EOS>
I was with Father Uwimana from Hotel de Mille Collines . We went together to father Veneche 's and we carried people who were hiding at Father ... Bishop Veneche 's in the pickup . This took us two rounds of times . <EOS>
Please sir ! We learnt from the case of a prisoner going by the name of Rutabana that he killed one 186 people picked from the church where gendarmes settled . There was a barrier too ; can you tell us that you really arrived there ? <EOS>
I arrived at Saint @-@ Paul and Mille Collines ! <EOS>
Do n't you think you can explain those things to us ? I mean the 186 people killed on that day . You know ... when only one person dies the whole area can get informed in one day . Did you never know anything ? Explain to us ! <EOS>
I told you that I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . By the way , why are people shouting when I am explaining ? <EOS>
They should keep quiet . Keep quiet ! We are about to give them the floor . We only want you to explain that minor issue . <EOS>
In the testimonies you received people said that I headed the attack ! I told you that on June 17th I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . We had been fighting the Interahamwe there all along the day . From there I went with Father Uwimana to pick people from Father Veneche 's .... Bishop Veneche 's . I carried them in two rounds in my pickup . Surprisingly , MP Rugema said that I was going to kill them . <EOS>
We have understood that . Let 's go back to Saint @-@ Michel 's issue . You told us no single individual died there whereas there is one called Semuhungu and his family . As the commander of the area , did n't you know that ? <EOS>
No , I did n't <EOS>
There were your gendarmes <EOS>
I did n't know it <EOS>
Eeh...I got it ! The man and his family died . He lived near Saint @-@ Michel <EOS>
According to the report I had from the priests , no one of the people who had escaped to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral died . I was told that . <EOS>
Let 's go on ! Let 's give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . You have actually talked about everything . Let 's now listen to the population ; you will get their views as well <EOS>
Allow me to add something ! <EOS>
Try to be brief <EOS>
In a word , I would like to ask you to carefully investigate this case . Some days earlier , at the tenth anniversary July 2004 , all the survivors who were living in that area praised the government authorities for having saved them . Their representative said @: "@ you should also thank also lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi who came to us for help @"@ . You may make noise Yes , but I am not lying ! The division commander who delivered the message is here himself ; he might explain it to you . <EOS>
The population said that they thank lieutenant @-@ colonel who came to them in difficult situations . They recommended delivering the message to me . I had the message that I had saved people . I can not understand the reason for of this trick of bringing fake accusations against me during the last days . Where does it come from ? <EOS>
This is not a trial , Sir ! <EOS>
It is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . The very people who were praising me just some days ago ! <EOS>
I did not mean to accuse you , Sir ! <EOS>
They have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me . <EOS>
That is a good thing . Any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it . I have not said that people must accuse you . We only have to let the two sides speak . We go to the Court Panel first and listen to their views . <EOS>
You said that you gave orders . Did you give orders and did not follow them up ? The problem arises there . More than 180 people died but you did n't know it . However , we know that when a person dies of a car accident in an area , we all come to see . As a high @-@ ranked Rwandan in the time , you should have known that . You should have known what your colleagues were doing . Tough the territory company was commanded by someone else , you had enough power yourself . You can see that we did not get the point well . <EOS>
I think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you . He also reminded you that , as a leader , you should have known the death of the people you have been asked about . That is his point . We go over to someone else <EOS>
Thank you Mister President . According to the information we have ... there is a prisoner called Rutabana who told us that you usually used to come to Sainte @-@ Famille with Father Munyeshyaka and that you were aware of all the things the prisoner could do . I want to ask you mister Munyakazi ; do n't you think you might have forgotten that information and that you have just been reminded ? It is also said that you might have taken some bodies and that the place where you took them is still unknown . You may also tell us about that . Thank you ! <EOS>
Thank you . I never drove that red bus . I had a white Hilux pickup . Even my driver belonged to the national gendarmerie . I never travelled in the red bus . You can see it is someone else they are talking about not lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . Let 's forget about that ; the red bus never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . <EOS>
It carried someone else . I used to travel in a white pickup . You can see that people mentioned the name of Munyakazi whereas it was not him . I used to travel in a white bus , with which I carried priests and nuns from Sainte @-@ Famille church . So the person who did those things wrongfully attributed to colonel Munyakazi .... That is not true Ladies and Gentlemen of gacaca court Panel . I did n't travel in that car at all . <EOS>
This is not a trial , Sir ! <EOS>
No this is a trial . It is being proceeded right now ! <EOS>
It is not a trial . He has just asked his question in his own way but this is not a trial . <EOS>
That question must remove all confusions . The red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . The second thing I did n't mention , I guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court Panel , is that I see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas I did my best to protect them . <EOS>
Once Saint @-@ Famille church was being fired at . I myself went to Sainte @-@ Famille church to console the population . We took sick people and they went to be treated in Red Cross infirmary . Red Cross was chaired by Kayiranga in the time . I never travelled in the red car . Remove that accusation completely . <EOS>
That is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , Sir ! Of course if it is one . We have not come for trial . You should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself . <EOS>
You are asking me what you 've been told though . <EOS>
Of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial . I go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well . <EOS>
Court Panel According to Rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp <EOS>
You had already been asked the question . As you do not know him , however , it is okay . you may explain <EOS>
I told you that distributing food was not among my duties . We can not be in war and see lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi distributing to displaced people . It is not possible at all . You can see well that he completely told lies . I told you that I gave the order to Captain Ntirugiribambe to tell gendarmes to go and bring food for displaced people to Father 's . I never distributed food . That accusation is wrong as well . Remove it too . <EOS>
It was not an accusation . He just wanted to know . Food can not be an accusation because everyone eats . <EOS>
He is saying I and the Interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people . <EOS>
court panel I want to ask a question . Mister colonel Munyakazi has just examples such as Mille Collines , Sainte @-@ Famille , and Saint @-@ Paul and he tried to help Rwandans everywhere . Probably he was doing that during the day . I would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action . Thank you ! <EOS>
Right ! About that question ... do you mean Rwandan journalists or foreign ones ? About that question ... About that question ... from 1992...from 1994 ... If you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people . All of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living . However if you read the book le droit de vivre by Hibert , you can see that book shows well that Hotel de Mille Collines was protected by Gendarmes according to the investigations . That is why people did not die there . That is what the book says <EOS>
There was an American who was with Gisimba 's displaced people in Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . We had taken him from Nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral . Even Gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major Karangwa <EOS>
Unfortunately this is not evoked . For the time being , however , people should know the action took place . When people arrived there , some were even told not to say they had been saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi because he would be charged of killings later . Fortunately there are gacaca courts ; you have given me the opportunity to tell you that I had given orders to the gendarmes of Hotel de Mille Coliines . I had given orders to people at Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . I also gave orders to gendarmes to go and fetch water and bring food . You have known that too . You can see that I did not intend to plot against Tutsis <EOS>
Yes sir , that was perfect . What you did at Mille Collines was perfect ! What you did is also recognized . Just because of the power you had in the time , we get curious and worried and we are obliged to ask you questions in order to know . We would also like to ask you to stand appropriately in front of the Court Panel . This is because people fear even to ask due to your dignity . No , by standing appropriately I do not mean standing that way . ; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity . They have said you are an important person so they have much respect for you . If you feel tired you may even sit down so that they may ask you . <EOS>
You know Sir ... may the Court Panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in Kigali . However , I had prepared it . I hope you will allow me that . When you check well that structure and see how I did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area ..... <EOS>
Yes you told me that you thank me for that ! However , I do not want someone to come and wrongfully accuse me of having travelled in the red pickup , of having headed attacks somewhere whereas I was in another area . That is why I have to provide explanations to show you that the accusations presented to you are false though you are trying to talk to me in a diplomatic way that this is not a trial . I have to defend myself . <EOS>
May be he was confused about it . If it was me , the President or any other of the Court Panel ; that would really be a fake accusation and you would have won the discussion . <EOS>
This is not a trial . The other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened . <EOS>
So , we want you to provide us with explanations . This is not a trial . It is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . We are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . We give the floor to someone else <EOS>
Court Panel Thank you . Just out of curiosity tell me about three questions @: you have been evoking MRND a bit a lot ; would you please let us know which political party you belonged to ? Second @: you told us that you drew reports denying the accusations brought against Tutsis . So I want to ask you ; as a high @-@ ranked personality of then who could go abroad at times , how many Tutsis have you warned ? Third @: you told us about a man called Ntirugiribambe . Where can we find him ? What was his responsibility ? Thank you . <EOS>
The first question concerns the political party I belonged to . According to the Rwandan constitution in force till June 10th 1991 , all Rwandans including you adhered to MRND . Surely it was the same for you . All people adhered to MRND . Even you because any Rwandan did . <EOS>
After June 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . Soldiers did not adhere to any political party . The second question you asked is about reports I drew and how many Tutsis I might have warned . <EOS>
I drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . I was told to verify . I committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . I did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at Sisi Evariste 's . <EOS>
I also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . That is why they started putting pressure on Habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating Tutsis and start releasing people . People were released . There are even people who were released . Habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore You should check those who are being released @"@ . <EOS>
In April 1991 ... It would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing Tutsis for fake accusations . I am telling you ; the report served a lot because I told foreigners that we had verified and found out that Tutsis were innocent . What was the third question again ? Ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of Nyarugenge . He exiled to Zaire . I do not know where he might be right now . Thank you ! <EOS>
Let 's first listen to these people . Hold on ! You will first introduce yourself , later ... <EOS>
What are your names ? <EOS>
My names are Nyirangazare Marie Immaculée <EOS>
Parents ? <EOS>
Ntwarabashi Joseph and Cecilia ... <EOS>
Date of birth ? <EOS>
1959 <EOS>
Place of birth ? <EOS>
Kabarondo in Kibungo <EOS>
District ? <EOS>
Kabarondo <EOS>
The province is Kibungo <EOS>
Are you Rwandan ? <EOS>
Yes Rwandan ? <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear @: I ... <EOS>
I swear to God that what I was going is true . <EOS>
You shall say the truth . Do not lie to us ! <EOS>
You have already said that this information collection . I would like to remind my brother some few things I can remember . <EOS>
In 1990 , I do not remember the month and date , he co @-@ presided over a very big conference I attended at Kimihurura . He was with Renzaho Tharcisse . They told us that any Rwandan living in Kigali had to return to his or her place of birth . Otherwise , they had enough soldiers in all over the country and bullets so that every Rwandan would be shot at . <EOS>
Renzaho ended saying @: "@ a word to a wise is enough ! @" This saying was a puzzle to us . We could not figure out what it meant . Many of us could not know what this intended to . I beg your pardon , I want to be very brief . A long time after , you , the then Gendarmerie commander , joined us somewhere in Sainte @-@ Famille . Do you know me ? Do you ? <EOS>
I want to give you my testimony first . You joined us in Sainte @-@ Famille during the war . You were with your men . They were so many . Meanwhile , before the war started ... you yourself and the republican guard at Kimihurura triggered off the war . When you were at Kimicanga , you ordered that all Tutsis be taken uphill . You added that you would kill even a Hutu who refused to bring them uphill . <EOS>
I escaped from then . It was 2 pm. Look at me carefully . I am not wrongfully accusing you . I escaped to Kiyovu . I spent three days there . You controlled the entire city together with Renzaho and other soldiers . Even when you were still lieutenant , you would say that you commanded the gendarmerie , that all gendarmerie 's cars were yours , that all the property of the gendarmerie were your own property <EOS>
You know Sir ; I do not have anything against you . I would advise that you accepted all that has been said and that you consider as lies . We are many witnesses for that . You know that we only wanted to remind each other . <EOS>
We shall give to each speaker minutes not to go beyond . <EOS>
I was born in Ubumanzi cell , Rugenge sector , Nyarugenge district . Thank you . <EOS>
Wait a bit ! You first raise your right hand and swear @: "@ I , your name , swear to God that what I am going to say is true @"@ . <EOS>
I , Gasasira Jean Marie Maurice , swear to God that what I am going to say is true . <EOS>
Tell the truth then ! <EOS>
Thank you mister President1 even though we have been given few minutes , I would like to ask to be given the same minutes as him because we are all equal before gacaca . <EOS>
In fact , he asked to give his testimony . We can not give you the same minutes as him considering your number . Try to look behind you ; there are other people . We might even receive testimonies from five people . You can see that the testimonies can not take such a time unless you want to tell us stories from 1959 as well ! In case you want , say , to evoke something wrong he did , just go straight . <EOS>
Thank you mister President and you ladies and gentlemen ! We are just at the information collection stage . I will only say few . I would also like to ask you to speed the proceedings because we have many accusations against him . <EOS>
Let us just give you little information . You shall probably show us where to give more . We actually do have more . Major General Munyakazi came to Sainte @-@ Famille many times . He was escorted by the pickup he has denied , which car travelled before his . <EOS>
He had his own car . The red one usually rolled before his . The car bore the script COMMUNE NYARUGENGE ... MRND COMMUNE NYARUGENGE . Do n't you all know those cars in this city ? The car bore the script COMMUNE NYARUGENGE above which MRND and COMMUNE NYARUGENGE was below . Such pickups were known in this city . People who were at Sainte @-@ Famille may remind each other . <EOS>
When he came to Sainte @-@ Famille he was always accompanied by Interahamwe . But he had his gendarmes as he already said . It is surprising , however , that , as a commander of Muhima military camp , he did not mention the name of Munyeshyaka among the priests but only limited himself to Celestin . <EOS>
You all know what Munyeshyaka did in this country . We always say his name . He is even known abroad . Munyakazi usually came to Munyeshyaka 's office where they held meetings together with another priest who was the army chaplain in ESM . <EOS>
The very Munyakazi here present ... After they entered the office , all other activities stopped . We will tell you the names of the army chaplain in other cessions . Mister President , I am now going to tell you the names of people who were taken from Sainte @-@ Famille and how they were taken . <EOS>
Shortly before April 28th , this man came to Sainte @-@ Famille . He went to Munyeshyaka 's and they killed people . I call upon people who were in Sainte @-@ Famille to remember well . Father Wensislas Munyeshyaka wore a bullet @-@ proof . this one wore the gendarmerie uniform and had a pistol in his white pocket . He said @: "@ what I want today is tutsis who are in Sainte @-@ FAMILLE @"@ . I beg you , mister President and other people who were in Sainte @-@ Famille with me , to follow up well this issue . He entered . He had come with Interahamwe from everywhere ; Gikondo , Muhima , Rugenge , I could even see my neighbors of Nyarugenge . Munyakazi and Renzaho , the prefect of the capital , were present as well . <EOS>
Those of our area , Rugenge had also come uphill . You remember four groups that were at Sainte @-@ Famille I guess . Renzaho , Munyakazi and the school inspector were all present . <EOS>
Please , look at the Court Panel not at the audience ! <EOS>
Thank you mister President . I just want that we may remind each other . In regard to the attack I am going to talk about , -@ I have already told you that the Interahamwe had all come uphill @- it is clear that it had already been planned since they all met there ; what means they were coming to kill Tutsis at Sainte @-@ Famille @: those from Muhima , Rugenge and Gikondo were all present . <EOS>
Sainte @-@ Famille sheltered people who were displaced in the time of Bucyana 's case . I will also tell you Tutsis who died on the altar . Munyakazi was also there if he remembers well . I am now going to tell you the Interahamwe from my area Rugenge . If it does please to him , he will also let us know those from Muhima and Gikondo because he was their commander . Those from Rugenge included . <EOS>
Nyirabagenzi Odette and Mukandutiye Angelina whose I do not know the address today ; Nzamwita Narcisse , a prisoner at Muhima ; Bagabo Leonard , a prisoner at Muhima as well ; Codo , released and living at Rugenge today ; Muhutu released and living at Rugenge today ; Bideri , we do not know where he disappeared ; Bikomagu ; Mathias , a dancer in Bikindi 's troop ; and Nyirankeshimana . <EOS>
I would like also to tell you , mister President , people who died in Sainte @-@ Famille church . They are 18 @: among them was a man from Gikondo who covered his head with a veil disguising himself in a woman . Munyeshyaka himself ... Wensislas Munyeshyaka said not to put the 18 people among others . They were all taken to Renzaho 's . <EOS>
It was said they were going to give some information concerning Inyenzi . I beg you , mister President , to go to the field so that we may prove what we are saying @: how he exercised his power and what happened under his authority . The people were tied with shirts and put into the pickup . Your own pickup , Mister Munyakazi , was white as you said but another before yours packed those people first . <EOS>
In that time the Interahamwe I have talked about were in four groups . It was clear that they were coming to Sainte @-@ Famille . When the people were taken , it was said they were going to give information about Inyenzi and residence certificates . We never knew what happened after . I beg him to tell us where they were taken @: what happened to those who proved innocent and those who were guilty so that we may even worthily bury them . The last thing , mister President , after having asked him about those who were taken to Renzaho 's .... -@ I guess I also have that right @- <EOS>
As you have just showed us the power you have on Munyakazi ... we shall bring our testimonies to the tribunal . But before I leave , I would like to ask you one thing @: he has been continuously evoking Rugema Donatien . He came to Sainte @-@ Famille escaping . You all know Rugema Donatien was jailed among accomplices in 1990 . I have a close family relationship with him ; he is my uncle . <EOS>
Rugema said @: "@ among people I have just escaped from , there is Munyakazi @"@ . He came crying and said @: "@ you should know that today is your last day @"@ . You all know Rugema at Kimihurura . His wife and children had just been killed . He arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille after his house had been attacked . Munyakazi had always been swearing to harm him . Rugema is my uncle . I will even communicate to him that Munyakazi 's case is being proceeded in the tribunal . <EOS>
We had tried it in 1997 . We wrote to the then military auditor general , Major Nzabanita Joseph that there was a man in the army called Laurent Munyakazi we were accusing of genocide . Fortunately gacaca has brought him to us . The judgment is up to you ! Ask us then . <EOS>
As far as I am concerned , we will continue together in proceedings because I have much to accuse him of ; from 1990 in the time of accomplices ' case . I accuse him of torturing Tutsis and people who were jailed among accomplices . He here is now ! I do not want to be too long mister President . We will be together in tribunals . I am asking you two things , Mister Munyakazi , in very strict words @: <EOS>
As you can see , this is still the information collection step . We have also tried to collect information concerning the people we lost . We heard of many things from people who happened to arrive at Sainte @-@ Famille during the first days . They told us that Munyakazi had been at SOPETRAD asking whether there was no shit to be cleaned off . That means Tutsis . He was answered that there were no tools . That is the information we have also collected so that justice for our people might be done . That is all they expect . <EOS>
They expect us to follow up their death because if we had known where that shit is , we would have buried it . They should tell us where our shit is then we shall bury it because it is just shit ! I do not want to be too long . We will be together in tribunals . The last thing , mister President , is about our personal security . You have just seen the way he is talking here ! The general might kill someone I swear ! Thank you . <EOS>
Tell us first your names then we will be asking you <EOS>
My names are Kayitaba Halufani <EOS>
Parents ? <EOS>
Karamutse Juvenal <EOS>
And who ? <EOS>
And Mukakibibi Ushizimpumu <EOS>
What is your cell of birth ? <EOS>
I do not know that . I left there cells changed . I will tell you my residence <EOS>
Your cell of residence ? <EOS>
I live in Rwampara cell , Biryogo sector , Nyarugenge district <EOS>
Raise your right hand <EOS>
Thank you ! Though you want me to swear , I am not giving any testimony . I am just asking <EOS>
Do not swear if you are asking <EOS>
I want to .... Mister Major General Munyakazi , you had told us a long story . However I think genocide took place between October 1st 1990 and December 1994 . He also told us about the invented scenario after which Tutsis were arrested in order to kill them . <EOS>
When you asked him you said that you want three things ; his role , what he saw and what he heard . You did not show us your role . In 1990 , at the time of the shootings I was here in Kigali . I know that many people were arrested by major General Munyakazi when he was still Major . He said that it was an invented scenario . I want to ask him why he arrested people knowingly . How did he consider that ? <EOS>
Second . At Nyamirambo Regional Stadium , many people called upon him for help because he was in a vey good position for that . Among people he helped , there is one woman he released and she went home . Others perished there . He told us he drew a report but I do not agree with him because if he had really drawn the report , he would have released the people from the stadium . On the contrary , he took them to jail . <EOS>
Third. You all know the international pressure . Even those who were not in the country might have read newspapers . That pressure made them release those they called accomplices . Why did n't he show us who was arresting people but only told us that he saved priests and nuns and did neither see nor hear of the death of more than 180 people at Sainte @-@ Famille ? Do you really think this gentleman will tell the truth as he swore ? He should spare our worries because the situation has already started worrying us ! Thank you . <EOS>
Come only if it is the matter of testimony . Those with suggestions will have their turn after . The turn is for witnesses . Those who do not have testimonies should move back ; they will have their turn and give their views . <EOS>
Right ! My names are Nyirubuntu Epaphrodite , I was born in 1970 . There is something I ... <EOS>
Wait ! Wait ! Tell us where you come from <EOS>
I come from Ntenyo district , Gasharu cell , kabusenyi sector , Ntenyo district in Gitarama <EOS>
Are you going to give us a testimony ? <EOS>
Yes , a testimony ! <EOS>
Eeh ! Raise your hand <EOS>
I , Nyirubuntu Epaphrodite <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God that what I am going to say is true . <EOS>
You did not mention your parents ' anmes ! <EOS>
My father 's names are Bugesera Wenslas , my mother 's Mukabaranga Asthérie . <EOS>
Tell us then ! <EOS>
Eeh , thank you ladies and gentlemen of the gacaca court Panel . I will only say little of Munyakazi . I will not say much since we have been given a short time . When the war broke off I was at Muhima . I was there when killings started . I left there on 14th with the help of someone who took me to Sainte @-@ Famille <EOS>
Eeh ... we spent there all the day on 14th and 15th . It seemed escaping from the rain under a sweating tree . Munyakazi came with Renzaho . He sent Interahamwe into the church . They started seating us in the very church and picking up people whom they packed in the red pickup he has often evoked . They carried them in eight rounds till they saw strong young men had almost finished . They mainly took young men <EOS>
Eeh ! Then after ... I will be brief . MINUAR came . They wanted to take people who wanted to go to the area controlled by RPF . MINUAR started by Mille Collines . We were carried in about two rounds . However Interahamwe could stop people at times but things ceased after on the date I do not remember well . It was probably on June 15th when MINUAR came . Meanwhile , they gave us a conference and told us they would come to take us . <EOS>
Eeh ! Renzaho entered . For Munyakazi , Sainte @-@ Famille was like his home because he usually came there . They usually came there with goats and asked to have their meal in priests ' buildings . The only priest who stayed there was called Wensislas Munyeshyaka . He [ Munyakazi ] was at Sainte @-@ Famille every time and every single hour . They were checking whether the number of young men was enough so that they might carry them out . <EOS>
They sometimes picked some and carried them out . Once they heard that MINUAR would come to take us . They met and said that in case young men were taken , RPF would gain much force . It would gain soldiers . It was decided that in case people would be taken , it had only to be children , old men and women <EOS>
At that time , Munyakazi himself , Renzaho and Munyeshayaka were standing there . They told a lady called Angelina to go and come with her Interahamwe in order to circle us . Let 's see ... they were discussing about the departure of young men on 16th That was the time they also told Angelina to come with her men to surround Sainte @-@ Famille <EOS>
They [ Munyakazi and others ] said that they would be bringing others during the whole night . The place was circled by the morning . Munyakazi himself came and went to carry them and dropped them behind the church . About 9 , they started climbing and getting into the enclosure . They ordered to only shoot at young men and not women <EOS>
We were seated and some of us were opened rapid fire at . We were seated on the floor . MINUAR came on 17th . It arrived . Those who were not killed , we were seated on the floor . Munyakazi who is defending himself entered and cried @: "@ withdraw ! Withdraw ! MINUAR are there ! <EOS>
"@ get out with those you have not yet killed and kill them outside @"@ . I also stood up among them . when I reached Sainte @-@ Famille ’ s door to the steward 's office , while Munyakazi and his colleagues were preventing MINUAR from getting in , I went to hide between containers which were there . Those who lived there know it . <EOS>
they did not see me because I was very small and they were rushing . They told them to follow the way ; I mean the very few who were not yet killed . They went to kill them outside . Some few days after , Munyakazi came back in the evening . He was with Munyeshyaka . They told us to carry the bodies . They went to hide them in the garage of the steward general 's office so that MINUAR might not see them . <EOS>
They left and on 19th Munyakazi himself came back with Angelina and Munyeshyaka . They said they wanted to see the gun which had been shooting at them . They did not want to have the gun actually ; they were looking for young men they might have not killed <EOS>
Munyakazi seated us and they picked young men whom they took into the minibus that stationed next to containers outside . I do not know where it had been taken from . Young men were seated in it . I stayed behind . This man owned a bar where Nzeyi worked . He [ Munyakazi ] even used to deliver driving licenses there some time ago in order to earn a little money . <EOS>
The man called Nzeyi was his employee . We could sometimes meet in Nzeyi 's bar . I stayed behind and I went to tell Munyakazi that we were not Inyenzi but displaced people . We were about to go downhill a bit . One of the young men tried to get off the car and enter the steward general 's office garage . Munyakazi and Munyeshyaka followed him . And I moved back . <EOS>
In so doing , ladies who worked in the infirmary that was there told me to sit down . They covered me with loincloths and sat by me . The young men sat there all along the day . In the evening , this man himself , Major General in front of you , came back . I do not know ... Though he is denying God will accuse him ! He himself carried away the young men . There were among them Gasongo Munyensanga , Uwiga Aloys , Ignace . I can only remember those because they were very close to me <EOS>
He carried the young men that evening . We do not know where he took them . Whether he employed them or ... we do not know . he should tell us where he might have kept our young men . He carried them away ; they were 18 . He took them away himself and only him ! Though he said he had no connection with Interahamwe , he once entered the church with twelve Interahamwe . They were not many and there was no policeman . <EOS>
Angelinana and Munyakazi were there . The Interahamwe left in the evening . Because he came back to take them away , he should tell us where he put our young men . I am almos through but , like my colleague , I also worry about my personal security . <EOS>

Raise your right hand and swear @: I ... <EOS>
I , Uwitije jean Paul , swear to God that what I am going to say is true <EOS>
Tell us the truth then <EOS>
I will tell you the truth . The first thing is that this very Munyakazi himself invited us . <EOS>
What Munyakazi told us is not a testimony at all . It is just a eulogy of his . Tutsis died . People from Ruhengeri killed them . what he said was not our expectation . We already know it . <EOS>
What I am telling Munyakazi is that he kept killing people and now people are accusing him . I am accusing him as well as someone who was at Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
I went there on 19th ... 14th . I left when the war ended . There are people who were at Sainte @-@ Famille but have not seen him yet well . I beg him to stare at me carefully . He himself , stood by me wile I was sitting down . I will remind him the words he pronounced then he will remember as he said he does not know anything . <EOS>
Munyakazi himself first came to Sainte @-@ Famille .... We 've been given few minutes by the way ! Munyakazi came and took away one lady called Chantal and about eight young men . He carried them in a pickup and he said he was taking them to Mille Collines . If the young men are still alive it might be just luck ; I can only see the woman today . <EOS>
Why is he saying he did not use to arrive at Sainte @-@ Famille ? I will remind him . After having taken those people ... He was always at Sainte @-@ Famille . When he came to Munyeshaka 's , he was like in his own property . He , with the Interahamwe of his company , always took people with them . When he was about to leave , they could put people into the pickup . Though he is saying he did not , we could see it starving though . <EOS>
Though he is saying he did not use to arrive at Sainte @-@ Famille ... you yourself Munyakazi ! After you had just seen people at Mille Collines , you came and stood in the middle of the path in the church garden near a water tank . You said @: "@ those who want to be facilitated to escape should come with me @"@ . <EOS>
We came in very big number believing you sympathized with us . You separated those who wanted to go to the side of Inyenzi and those who wanted to go to the government . Realizing that the number of those who wanted to the Inyenzi 's side was bigger , you became angry and moved your spectacles . You talked to Renzaho . I do not know what you said . Only you know . You even immediately left . <EOS>
The following day , I think there were still few people left at Mille Collines . You came for evacuation . When you arrived you did not allow any man to go . When he wanted you said he was going to join Inyenzi . You can see well that we know that you were present . Do not try to tell a single lie . Then after , you went and told the Interahamwe to stop men so that only women might go . <EOS>
Even those who received them can say it . On June 16th the day I will n't forget , after people had been taken to Saint @-@ Paul and we were staying there , you came and stared at us <EOS>
Then you went out and came back at once with Renzaho , commander Gisunzu , Angelina , and the then sector councilor called Odette I guess . You went some where . You were with the Interahamwe Kimba and Seseko . Because you are saying that you were not there ; I am just reminding you . <EOS>
You came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . Then ... you Munyakazi . They started picking people . Among those left , there was a man called Enock and others . There were still about ten people in front of Amri 's house . You talked and after a while we saw the Interahamwe standing all along the fence . We were outside the church . We were sitting in the sunshine . At once , we heard the Interahamwe shooting at the door of the church . <EOS>
Women had stayed in . they ran out . Meanwhile , there was a policeman with them called Yoramu or something alike . He was from Ruyenzi . He had arrived in the morning and told us @: "@ you know what ! Today might be your last day ! Inyenzi have taken others with them . What about you then ? @" <EOS>
What he had predicted became true . You came with many Interahamwe . Every man was shot at . We survived by heaven 's will . Only God saved us because no man would have survived . We stayed there till the night . I understand why you say you do not know it ; it is because it did not concern you . I was hiding in grass . There were toilets we had dug . <EOS>
Then I went down . I ran when gunshots worsened . Somewhere down I joined men sitting down . These are the men my preceding colleague was talking about . You came and stood on the slope . <EOS>
You were with the Interahamwe Kimba and Seseko . You came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . Then ... You Munyakazi ... They started picking people . Among those left there was a man called Enock and others . There were still about ten people left . <EOS>
Seseko was nicknamed Chief Staff . They used to call him by that name . I told him about a young girl of his family who had come from Mutara . Actually , he was killing us while he himself was being hunted . I do not know what he had been given so to kill ! I asked him @: "@ are you going to shoot at me as you do to others while I saved a girl of your family ? @" <EOS>
He asked me @: "@ why have you come here ? @" I told him @: that "@ I am businessman and all the money was taken from me ; so I have no money to give them so that I might be released . So I have come here @"@ . He asked me @: "@ why have n't stayed on the yard and prefer to join Inyenzi ? @" I said @: "@ I just came here ! @" He asked me with whom I was . I gestured like this and showed him that I was with all of them . He asked me @: "@ why are with all of these Inyenzi ? @" <EOS>
Then , came another black tall young man in sports suit . His name must be Ntirugiribambe Samuel ; I guess . You were standing nearby . He was brought there . Others were immediately shot at in the very place . You asked @: "@ why are bringing this ? @" they immediately shot at him and he ran away saying @: "@ mercy ! Mercy ! @" on that you said @: "@ taste it ! Why did you come here ? @" <EOS>
Calm down first then you will tell us . If you can n't go on , wait and calm down ! You have your time . Let him . He has not finished yet . He will resume . Let him calm down first . <EOS>
On 19th , you , Munyakazi , came back and took away people you found there . You said that there were others you had taken from the church . You came to us and we were about eight people down the water tank . You were with an Interahamwe . He himself said that at Rugenge . You started designating people telling them to stand up . The Interahamwe beat me with a gun on my back , I fell down and you came to stand by me and wondered @: "@ what hell on earth has this come here for ! @" <EOS>
"@ Have n't they always been told to stay on the yard ? @" did n't you say it yourself ? <EOS>
My names are Mudenge Sylivain <EOS>
parents ? <EOS>
Son of Byisi ..... <EOS>
1973 <EOS>
What is your cell of birth ? <EOS>
Gatsinda cell ; it is now Kabare ; Byumba province ; Rushaki district , former Kiyombe <EOS>
You shall raise your right hand if you are going to give a testimony . Or tell us whether it is a point of view . Is it a testimony ? <EOS>
There is someone we talked to who has got information . He shall say it and then I will give my testimony about what I saw then I will end by asking two questions . I will n't bee too long actually <EOS>
Raise your right and swear as it is a testimony . You shall say @: I , your name ... <EOS>
I , Mudenge Sylvain <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God that what I am going to say is true <EOS>
Tell us then <EOS>
I will start by the information I had from James . He told me how he lost his mother in 1990 . James is employed in MIMPLAN . Munyakazi ... <EOS>
It is an information ? <EOS>
It an information and testimony frm James <EOS>
From James ? <EOS>
But he is alive . He lives in Ubumanzi or Ubumwe cell <EOS>
Tell us an other name of James <EOS>
I do not remember it . Others may help me . But I know where he lives <EOS>
Tell us in brief what he told you . <EOS>
Actually , Munyakazi you know ! We even once had a talk . But I have first to say what I was told by James . It was in 1990 , I do not remember the date ; James will say it himself . Munyakazi took James and a person nicknamed The priest to police station . It was Kigali central Prison in the time . I was told this by James . When they arrived there He told them @: "@ do you see the place ? @" James will say this himself ; I only say this so that we grasp the information in advance . <EOS>
Arrived , he told them that he wanted to take them to that place . They both resisted . Then he told them @: "@ let 's forget about for the moment @"@ . He immediately called Muhima police station office . Since then they were jailed . It was in the time of "@ accomplices ' imprisonment @"@ . That is all I was told . We might ask him personally when he will be present . <EOS>
As far as I am concerned @: in the time , I lived in a different place . I lived in Ubumwe cell , Rugenge sector , former Kabasengerezi . I was a student in senior IV at Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux . <EOS>
I arrived in Cela on 7th at 1 p.m. on 22nd , Munyakazi , Renzaho , Angelina Mukandutiye and many others were there . I think this has even been being evoked by my colleagues <EOS>
You were coming for final cleansing . You were accompanying them and you arrived there . I would like also to beg you to ask the minister of defense here present because they once arrived together at Saint @-@ Paul . He arrived , I was with Robert and many other guys whose I do not remember names since I have not prepared it properly . I have just come from Cyangugu unexpectedly . When I heard that he would be invited , I took the advantage because I have come twice and it did not <EOS>
On 22nd , you came . I should also be asked about the 20th at Saint @-@ Paul in Cela <EOS>
Which month ? <EOS>
April. He used to pass there as an authority . When he had just left , Father Munyeshyaka , the then Sainte @-@ Famille parish priest , arrived in a gown together with Gasasira . When he talked he was wearing a bullet @-@ proof <EOS>
In case I forget I beg him to remind me because he , Munyakazi , came to take some people . There were Mukamurenzi and other athletes . I have forgotten many names . The reason I point at him is that he once came with Robert Kajuga . So , many often events overlap in fact . <EOS>
Without turning around the bush , I can firmly confirm that these people are genocide planners . I do n't want to take too long on that . Have a nice work and thank you . <EOS>
Wait. We want to ask you a little bit . You told us that you arrived at Cela but you have not told us how was the situation there <EOS>
I may have trouble . I will tell you when I will be invited or I may even send a script to you . Otherwise , you may read the book Entitled African . There is full information . For the moment I want to end by asking my questions <EOS>
Mudenge , can you please stop worrying and calm down so that we may ask you ? We may even wait a while for you to calm down and tell us what happened . You have just said that he arrived at Cela , with Renzaho , Nyirabagenzi Odette and Angelina . What happened next ? <EOS>
They came with Kagame . Kagame who is not the president of the republic . He can not be of such a riff @-@ and @-@ raff . They arrived there . They were many . I think they took with them Albert and others . I do not remember the . There might be people who do more than me . They made people stand on their knees ... even my sister was made to . <EOS>
I think even Honorable Kanzayire was hiding there . We went and sat down . We hid in an infirmary where priests found us . There were many people <EOS>
His Excellence Munyakazi arrived . After he left Father Munyeshyaka came too . They continued to saint @-@ Paul . It is too difficult for me to provide full information in fact . I am afraid I may lose control . However , I can answer some few questions if there are any . Or ... you may even ask the very questions to Renzaho or any other you may find belonging to his group . <EOS>
Ask the questions you have just evoked <EOS>
My question is about ... I was praying during that time . I would like to ask him about Father Munyeshyaka when he arrived at Saint @-@ Paul after him ... many have even been saying this . They came and separated people then took some with them . <EOS>
What can he tell us about Munyeshyaka ? He has already said a lot and you took notes . What can he tell us about the attacks at Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux ? I am curious because I was a student there but I did not have time to investigate due to everyday problems . Can he tell us about Saint @-@ Michel ? Can he tell us about Saint @-@ Paul after we left there saved and they still had Sainte @-@ Famille ? We want to spare our worries . <EOS>
The last speaker has just asked Munyakazi to say what happened at Saint @-@ Paul after they left there <EOS>
We would like to facilitate you Sir . So to go faster , we shall tell you questions to answer ! <EOS>
He has lastly asked about Munyeshyaka . We know that Munyeshyaka lives in France . Probably he would like to know what you know about Munyeshyaka 's role because he might have been close to you . Would you give some explanations about that ? Let 's start by that one . <EOS>
Munyeshyaka ... actually Sainte @-@ Famille 's parish priest was Mwumvaneza Anaclet . Wensislas was his assistant . On April 9th and 10th , Anaclet was Sainte @-@ Famille 's parish priest . He left the church , passed through the steward general 's office and went to hide at Bishop Vemeshi 's <EOS>
Wensislas Munyeshyaka stayed in the Sainte @-@ Famille church . However as I told you ... <EOS>
Listen Sir , in order to be brief and save time you should n't tell a long story when you are asked a question . <EOS>
Tell us for example @: Munyeshyaka did this and this or if you do n't know say you do n't <EOS>
All I know of Munyeshyaka is that he was in charge of those displaced people . I told you that I did not participate to those attacks people have been talking about . <EOS>
That is what I told the Court Panel . People have also been evoking the date of June 17th 1996 <EOS>
The Court Panel had already asked me to say what I did on this date of June 17th 1996 . I told the tribunal that on this date of June 17th 1996 <EOS>
When RPF had taken people from Saint @-@ Paul , you know there was a zone belonging to RPF , Interahamwe attacked all the places . I immediately went to Hotel de Milles Collines because the Interahamwe had just broken doors there <EOS>
Though it is being said that I was at Sainte @-@ Famille chasing MINUAR soldiers , those who were in that area were staying at Hotel de Mille Collines . I spent the entire day with them . their commander was lieutenant @-@ colonel Mwangi from Congo Brazzaville <EOS>
I never chased MINUAR soldiers . Neither did I see the attacks of Interahamwe as I told the tribunal . <EOS>
Start by the first question so that we may go on . I think you have just answered the first question by Epa <EOS>
I answered all of them together . People have all been revolving around the date of June 17th and I had already explained about it to the tribunal . <EOS>
So let us ask you some questions . Many questions have been asked in fact but we shall help you to go faster <EOS>
There is a question by Nyirangazare about the conference you co @-@ presided with Renzaho Tharcisse saying they had to leave Kigali for their places of birth <EOS>
You shall explain the reason for that in brief . Did it take place or no ? <EOS>
It did n't <EOS>
She evoked something of Sainte @-@ Famille but you have been explaining that . There is one question left <EOS>
What I can add , if you do allow ! I read of Nyirangazare in New Times and someone called Gasongo was often evoked . <EOS>
It is said that I took away that Gasongo from Kibuye on that day when he left saint @-@ Paul center <EOS>
Concerning what Gasasira said they had submitted the accusations in the army auditor 's office , at Nzabanita Joseph 's , I did n't know it . I was never called in order to provide explanations <EOS>
All I know is that people from Kibuye complied with the accusations by Rugema and Kabera who was the prefect as you might have learnt . A verification commission <EOS>
Was even established on June 1st 1999 . <EOS>
A member of the commission once joined me in Gisenyi . I will say his name later as you said this is not a trial . I was with officers I commanded . He told them that there were many accusations against lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi <EOS>
However , we conducted an investigation and we found that Rugema Donatien and Prefect Kabera were wrongfully accusing lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi . <EOS>
The person would have been here and give you explanations if he had not been abroad . If things do not improve , he told me he will come <EOS>
And show you that it was found out that those accusations were fake ones brought to me whereas we are all leaders as it sometimes happens when one hates another <EOS>
The person joined me there and told me that I was wrongfully accused ; that I never killed a single individual ; that those I took away <EOS>
On 17th , 18th , and 19th I took them to saint @-@ Michel cathedral ; that they found out that they are all alive . It was said when I was with officers ; they may come and tell you . <EOS>
I never knew that investigation conducted by the army auditor 's office . That 's all I knew . <EOS>
You are going too far Sir . We have what we are asking you that is simpler . <EOS>
We want you to be brief . We need to leave this place <EOS>
There is someone , I think Gasasira but others also said the same , who talked about eighteen young men that you might have taken away who were tied with shirts <EOS>
Saying they were to provide some information . They must be those you took away in order to save them . What would you say ? <EOS>
He , as well as others , may be wondering @: who proved innocent ? Where are others ? Would you explain it more ? <EOS>
I told you that the people I took on 17th , 18th , and 19th from Sainte @-@ Famille and Procure <EOS>
Were all taken to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . They are all alive . That 's what I told you . <EOS>
I never carried those other people in the pickup people have been talking about red or .... Not at all <EOS>
They said you arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille . Did you or not ? So that we may ask tell us first whether you entered ? <EOS>
I went there even at the time of GOMME falling down . Every time there was a problem and I was called upon for help I went as an authority <EOS>
Given many people always died there -@ you might be aware of it yourself @- and that you arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille Sir ; <EOS>
What did you do as far as stopping Interahamwe is concerned as an authority having armed men under your command ? Did you give any report about your humanitarian action at Sainte @-@ Famille ? <EOS>
I told Interahamwe were established by MRND and Impuzamugambi by CDR. They were not equipped by Laurent Munyakazi <EOS>
I also told you I did my best to help the population <EOS>
Would you spare our worries about the people who died on 17th and 16th whom Epa said you put their bodies in the steward 's office buildings , <EOS>
In the steward general 's office garage in order to hide them from MINUAR General ? Would you tell us about that General ? <EOS>
I did not kill them . here is the whole story @: <EOS>
Eeh ! Tell us if you do know <EOS>
As I told you , Interahamwe attacked Saint @-@ Paul center , Sainte @-@ Famille church , and Hotel de Mille Collines . I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . <EOS>
Interahamwe entered Sainte @-@ Famille church , took people form the church and shot at them between Procure and the church . As I was told by some priests .... I saw one here by the way ! <EOS>
He might explain it to you . ... their bodies were taken to the steward general 's office buildings . That took place yes but as I told you I did not head that attack <EOS>
I am accused of . I was fighting the Interahamwe at Hotel de Mille Collines . There are even proofs <EOS>
That is perfect Sir ! Have you just acknowledged you knew that the bodies were taken to the steward general 's office garage ? <EOS>
I was told by priests that the bodies were taken from where they had been shot at , between the church , Procure and priests ' buildings <EOS>
People were shot at there . There were many Interahamwe ; that is true . I was at Hotel de Mille Collines <EOS>
I never headed those attacks though I have just been accused of it together with colonel Renzaho , Angelina and Odette <EOS>
I was at Hotel de mille Collines helping all people who were there . I think it was that time when Father Uwimana saw that I had just helped people <EOS>
And asked me to go and help the people who were at Father Vermerie 's <EOS>
We got it . Would sit a bit ! Please wait a moment . Wait <EOS>
I am father Galican . My address is here at Saint @-@ Paul center . I was born in Gitarama in Rubona sector <EOS>
Cell ? <EOS>
Munyinya cell , ruhango town . The testimony I have come to give ... <EOS>
Wait ! You shall swear . Raise your right hand and say @: I ... <EOS>
I , Galican <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
We are expecting Father to tell us the truth given you were there and watched the whole scenario <EOS>
My mother is Kamanazi charlotte <EOS>
Year of birth ? <EOS>
1962 <EOS>
Tell us the truth Father ! <EOS>
I would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
Whereas it is the center of the problem . People have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way <EOS>
We , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @: <EOS>
on Sainte @-@ Famille primary school playground , on Sainte @-@ Famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by Interahamwe <EOS>
Those who were at Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul even at Cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from Interahamwe <EOS>
Right ! We did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from Interahamwe <EOS>
We did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . That means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings <EOS>
In order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there <EOS>
As well us to make sure their security is guaranteed during that time <EOS>
We did not , however , inform the displaced people over there that we resorted to this person or another <EOS>
We did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against Sainte @-@ Famille <EOS>
There were even people who held meetings among them . There were Xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack . The information could be got that way <EOS>
Since we could not know those who were connected to Interahamwe , we did not reveal anything . <EOS>
One could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . That is the way it worked <EOS>
I do not even know why people have not evoked Munyeshyaka . Munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . He never intended to betray people . <EOS>
That is why I was telling you people understand things in differently . We , as priests either in Sainte @-@ Famille or <EOS>
Saint @-@ Paul ... we had appointed Father Celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ Paul . I do n't know why people did not mention that Interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies <EOS>
As they came to Sainte @-@ Famille to take and kill people . This leads me to talking about Munyakazi now <EOS>
Because Munyeshyaka was close to soldiers , we had appointed him to calling gendarmes to come to us for help <EOS>
He was also appointed to going and fetch food from Nyamirambo and CARITAS be cause he was known in high @-@ ranked soldiers <EOS>
What I am telling you is a true testimony . I would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
We had resorted to Minister Aloys . Munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and Interahamwe were coming to kill people <EOS>
He said he was going to handle the situation . I worked with Munyeshyaka . Then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day . <EOS>
Gendarmes settled at Procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed . <EOS>
Once a very strong attack came to take people from Sainte @-@ Famille and because Interahamwe entered in disorder , <EOS>
We asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance . They did it . <EOS>
However as I said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks <EOS>
They were stronger than them till Munyakazi himself some were stronger than him <EOS>
We should not say he did not help us in fact . However , he may say that at a time he could not handle the situation . Unless those people would not have probably died <EOS>
I am still on <EOS>
Please , listen ! <EOS>
I still have the floor . If we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things <EOS>
We shall ask him questions . He will explain . Listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his . Please , stop shouting <EOS>
What I can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed . <EOS>
It became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting Inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield <EOS>
We asked that some might be transferred . You can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out . <EOS>
After that , the Interahamwe talked about who were at Sainte @-@ Famille set a barrier saying Inyenzi were being given water . <EOS>
After the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . They did it . <EOS>
If one does not agree , I would ask him to tell us where the water used to cook the food he ate was from . That happened but I was not with you anymore . <EOS>
Another thing is that on the 17th when people died I had already left <EOS>
In the parish Yuhi where I lived , I went with Major Nsanzimfura Jean Baptiste after having called him for help that that the Assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . I told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place <EOS>
He told me to go and take them . I first feared to go far and he ensured me that if I was to die we would both die . <EOS>
So , we went together . Okay ! That evening we were facilitated from Gitikinyoni to Sainte @-@ Famille by one thing ; <EOS>
Inkotanyi were shooting and bombarding a lot in order to come and take people from Saint @-@ Paul . <EOS>
We came and arrived around midnight because our tyre deflated . We had never been at ease all along the journey . At any time we could be told @: <EOS>
"@ Speed up ! We may get shot at @" because the car was slow . <EOS>
Arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille , I spent the night in Procure with Father Munyeshyaka because I had forgotten the keys of the door from the steward 's office to Saint @-@ Paul . <EOS>
Then we heard a lot of bullet shots in Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
We heard a lot of bullet shots and thought that Interahamwe had come to kill people because it had been rumored <EOS>
That people in Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul not killed yet would be killed together without much effort of killers . We immediately thought the latter were killing people . <EOS>
I remember that Father Munyeshyaka told a soldier called Murekezi to call MINADEF and tell them that Interahamwe were killing people left at Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
The soldier did then told him @: "@ Inkotanyi are already there @"@ . They had just known what we thought was wrong . <EOS>
I wanted to leave then and I told them that at night one can not recognize that another wears a bulletproof . What they said is true he wore a bulletproof . <EOS>
The following morning -@ I had already spent the night in Procure @- The intrepid people I talked about ... I mean Interahamwe <EOS>
Would you be brief father ? There are still other people who want to talk <EOS>
Okay ! I just want to tell you about the following morning . It is true that colonel Munyakazi arrived <EOS>
In the morning <EOS>
On 17th ? <EOS>
On 17th he arrived and left some time after . After he left ... after he arrived we got up . Coming and seeing people who were shot at by ex @-@ FAR <EOS>
for having attempted to get to the round @-@ about when hearing bullet shots -@ some were dead and others wounded @- the Interahamwe said @: "@ weep not , we are soon revenging you @"@ . <EOS>
No sooner had they said so than I quickly ran to hide in Saint @-@ Paul . <EOS>
As I was saying , those people really died in the yard of priests ' buildings . <EOS>
After they were killed , the bodies were thrown in the grave that was in the steward general 's office garage <EOS>
I can n't say that ... I with others wo were in Saint @-@ Paul only heard they were being killed . We ourselves were hiding <EOS>
In the afternoon , around 5 p.m. General Munyakazi came to take us . He took us to the archbishop 's palace . <EOS>
We went there . Some time after the French Bernard Couchner met us there . We told him @: "@ so to verify the scandals , <EOS>
Go to Sainte @-@ Famille and enter the garage ; you will see a heap of bodies @"@ . <EOS>
It was true because we had just known that the bodies were still there . <EOS>
They went . As soon as they arrived ... the gendarmes who were at the main entrance ... -@ I do not know whether there are some who are still alive . But in case there are , they should apologize to you <EOS>
Because they prevented those people from getting in order to cover the scandals that were done @- <EOS>
That is what happened there but the story is longer than that . If there are questions you may ask me . <EOS>
I want to ask you one question Father ; the bodies thrown in the garage , have they been exhumed and worthily buried or not yet ? <EOS>
After some time after the bodies went stinking and people came and went to bury them . But where they were buried .... <EOS>
Who took them away ? <EOS>
I can not know that . We were at archbishop 's palace at that time . I do n't have information <EOS>
Were they taken from the graves and taken away ? <EOS>
They were taken from the graves and taken away ? The graves were still stinking even after war . <EOS>
Have you said Munyeshyaka had a bullet @-@ proof and a pistol ? Was he a soldier ? <EOS>
He was n't <EOS>
Are you allowed to possess guns and military uniform ? <EOS>
Munyeshyaka first owned a Kalashnikov , then <EOS>
Please listen <EOS>
He once phoned me and told me that he had just had a gun . I went and joined him at Sainte @-@ Famille . I asked him whether he could dare bear a gun on his shoulders and walk . He told me that it was of course heavy . <EOS>
He told me that he was going to ask for a pistol . He asked for it and he got it . I asked him whether he would shoot at person with it . He slipped on his shirt and put it here . <EOS>
Then I told him @: "@ what will you do with a pistol ? @" He answered @: "@ I can not dare kill . <EOS>
It is just to make the Interahamwe believe that I am one of them and then fear me @"@ . That is what he told me . So , I told him to slip on it but not to reveal it . <EOS>
"@ It would be of no use . @"@ Why would I have asked for it if I slip on it then ? It is just to make the Interahamwe fear me , see me and find in me a partner @" he said . <EOS>
Are you allowed that at least ? <EOS>
Of course we are not . We are not soldiers . <EOS>
Let 's go to Mister Munyakazi once again . Did you tell us that the Inkotanyi came and took people from Saint @-@ Paul on April 16th 1994 ? <EOS>
Munyakazi arrived there in the morning . What did you talk with him ? What did he come for ? <EOS>
I did not talk to him <EOS>
What did he come for ? <EOS>
I do not even know that . I just got out of Procure -@ I spent my night there @- and I found him there . Then after he left . I would be lying if I gave further explanations <EOS>
You might go to your place ! We want the lady who wants to for work . Do not worry . Your turn is coming soon . You can also see that she is old . Introduce yourself first . <EOS>
Thank you . My names are Agnes Mukandutiye <EOS>
Parents ? <EOS>
Vincent Bujegenya and Gashongore Marianne . I was born in Rutonde <EOS>
Your mother again ? <EOS>
Is a testimony ? Tell us whether it is testimony <EOS>
I am going to give a testimony just for some minutes <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear @: I , your name ... <EOS>
I , Agnes Mukandutiye <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
That all I am going to say is true <EOS>
Tell us now <EOS>
In my speech , I will focus on the date of June 19th 1994 especially about the confusion of the red and white cars . <EOS>
On that date in the morning , Angelina who was the school inspector in Nyarugenge arrived with Munyakazi . She said that Inyenzi had been shooting at her all along the night and that they were shooting from Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
They immediately went in the church together with Interahamwe . I do not know their names because I was from Cyahafi sector . <EOS>
Angelina saw me and exclaimed @: "@ Tutsis , you are as hardy as weed . Are you still alive Mukandutiye ? @" She was an acquaintance of mine actually . <EOS>
Next she told me to join others . They were 18 young men and I was the nineteenth . <EOS>
In my testimony I want to thank this man Munyakazi because he saved me . How would have saved me if he had not arrived then ? <EOS>
I went out with the young men . When we reached the red car I was talking about , Munyakazi told Angelina @: "@ I do n't know anything wrong with this woman ! @" <EOS>
Angelina replied @: "@ We have been sent by Renzaho . Why do n't you come with us and go to tell him that the woman is innocent ? @" <EOS>
What Munyakazi did immediately ; he told me @: "@ go back @"@ . I really thank you Sir . However , we would like to know where the young men disappeared . <EOS>
Let 's receive that one . What are your names ? <EOS>
Ntaganzwa Evariste <EOS>
parents ? <EOS>
Eeh ! ... <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear @: I ... <EOS>
I , Ntaganzwa Evariste <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
Tell us now ! <EOS>
I will n't say much of Munyakazi . I have come because of the red car he is denying . <EOS>
The day many people among them Bidede were carried from Saint @-@ Paul is the day when he [ Munyakazi ] carried many people among them Bideli in three rounds of time . <EOS>
He carried in the car Bidede and others . That is the day when people were killed at Rugenge sector 's office . You remember their number . <EOS>
For the first round , he carried Bidede and others . What about the second and the third ? <EOS>
The first round I am talking about there were Bideli and other young men from Kacyiru whose names I do not remember . There were also other guys from Nyanza <EOS>
There were also Murashi 's children from Numuhungu 's place and a one @-@ handed small boy called Rukinirwa . Actually those bodies which were lying there from the tarmacked road down to Rugenge . All those bodies ! For sure Bidede was among them . <EOS>
I am talking about Bidede because he was the first to be caught , then shot , and finally burnt with oil <EOS>
From there , they went downhill killing people up to the farm in Rugenge sector . <EOS>
When the car reached , people on board included @: Ngamije , <EOS>
Ndamage , Bikomagu who was Nyirabagenzi 's brother I guess . <EOS>
They said that they were sent by Munyakazi in order to take off the shit down Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
I was listening . The barrier was set in front of Kigega 's and Martin 's houses . They came and said that was the task given to them by Munyakazi . I was sitting in a bar near Bizimana 's house . I was listening . <EOS>
They told me to join others and go to cleanse . I told them that I did not understand that language . I sat down again . I was holding a bible . <EOS>
They went up cleansing as they said . They went to Saint @-@ Paul . The first person who approached me is Mazimpaka who asked me about Murashi 's son ... <EOS>
He told me that in case I found one of his family members I would tell him about his death . Of course if would be still alive myself ! <EOS>
No sooner had he said it than Ngamije and Ndagijimana asked me whether I knew him . I said that I did , that his name was Mazimpaka . They ordered me @: @" go this way ! follow him @" <EOS>
Then I told them @: "@ yes I will @"@ . When I wanted to stop they pushed me and I fell on the other side of the road . I sat there . <EOS>
They started their task . What I want to say is that though Munyakazi is denying the red car , it went for the first round , went back to carry others . It went three times . <EOS>
For the third round he brought those young men . They were sixteen . They were killed in CND down Rugenge sector 's office . <EOS>
There was Mutarambirwa 's son who jumped over the fence of the house over there and went downhill through those houses . This is written in the cell gacaca court record . <EOS>
The car turned back . They said it was going to bring others up there . I do not those , however . So , denying the car , whereas the people said they were sent by Munyakazi to cleanse , is contradictory . <EOS>
After a while I saw the same car to the place where we were . He may then explain how he did not it given he said that the displaced people comprised two parts of which one for the government in Sainte @-@ Famille yard . I think he must know them . <EOS>
Another part @: those who were hiding in Sainte @-@ Famille church . I think he might clarify those things and how he does not know the car ... Actually I once saw him in the white car <EOS>
that he acknowledges . He came to the barrier to see someone . I do know the man who was with him . He immediately met one cell leader from Rugenge ; Narcisse . <EOS>
They went together some steps to Nyanza . I was watching . After some minutes they were back and held a small a meeting . They left Nyirabagenzi there who ordered not to tear Tutsis ' steel sheets anymore but collect them and later be used to build houses to live in , <EOS>
and to grant to the poor survivors some of the steel sheets . <EOS>
The following morning , Mukeshimana 's father came to destroy steel sheets of Nzabonitegeka Gaston 's houses . When he started , I reminded him that the sector councilor had ordered them not to destroy steel sheets . <EOS>
I asked him @: "@ why are you destroying them ? What will you build your own houses with ? @" On that , he ordered Jonas ' son to come and teach me a lesson and go back to carry wood . <EOS>
Please Evariste ; tell us about the role of this man first . We shall follow up that after <EOS>
His role is that though he is denying the car , everything was done under his command . Jonas ' son beat me here ! <EOS>
When I went for treatment at Rutayisire 's , I did not find him . He had been taken to the hospital because all other people of his clinic had been all killed <EOS>
I went to Sainte @-@ Famille ; the gendarmes and Xaverians sled me where I would be treated <EOS>
Nurses there could not treat me . Then they told me to go out very quickly because something bad was to take place in a short time . <EOS>
When I went down to Sainte @-@ Famille the Interahamwe there took me and made me sit down there all the day . Munyakazi should not deny because he used the two cars . <EOS>
No one should not go beyond three minutes . Be brief . As a group you should write and give us a written testimony . <EOS>
You shall Bring the testimony to the tribunal if there are other issues in relation to aiding and abetting . <EOS>
Wait a moment <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear @: I , your name <EOS>
I , Uwanyirigira Mathilde <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going is true <EOS>
That what I am going is true <EOS>
Tell us <EOS>
People have been talking about Sainte @-@ Famille and Saint @-@ Paul . I was at Nyamirambo in Saint @-@ André. I want to talk about what happened there . <EOS>
because the gentleman might have no time to go there due to daily activities . <EOS>
It was on the 6th . It was known that there were babies from Nyacyonga . <EOS>
When we were attacked , priests who were there said that they had babies who deserved no death at all <EOS>
Then , we asked the priests @: "@ as you have babies , take also ours , go and put them may be in Red @-@ cross or Hotel de Mille Collines ... wherever provided they are survive . Please help us . <EOS>
We knew that we had absolutely to die . <EOS>
On June 8th , they called upon a French who worked may be in Red @-@ Cross , I do not remember well <EOS>
He came to see the babies . As soon as he arrived , he was shot at . Priests called Mister General Munyakazi for help . He came and entered the place where we were staying <EOS>
anytime we heard soldiers we would immediately went under beds , in rooms , everywhere ! He came and took all of us from there . He used a French word @: "@ c' est impossible ! We thought here were only babies . Get out . All of you @"@ . <EOS>
We went out . We went closer and greeted him . He did not harm us at all . We told him @: "@ we know you are a high @-@ ranked soldier here in Kigali . <EOS>
And we have babies . We are not asking you to save us . We know you can go nowhere with us . Pleases save at least our babies ! @" <EOS>
He told us that he would handle the problem @: @"@ on va voir ! @" it was on 8th . On 9th we spent the day there . On 10th , people among them Munyakazi , came shooting into windows . <EOS>
They shot tear @-@ gas into us in such a way that some babies died . There were many women and babies . We were then packed like cassavas or beans into a DAIHATSU pickup . <EOS>
Once on the pickup , I realized that my eldest child who was five was not there . I insisted to go down and take my child . <EOS>
I went down and looked for my child . Once I found , we came together . When I arrived I found that people on board were being beaten with guns . <EOS>
I remember that there was an Interahamwe who moved off a priests ' motorbike . General Munyakazi shot at its tyres and said @: "@ have you come to take off priests ' property ? @" <EOS>
Before I got into the car , I heard some people saying for example @: "@ I am hutu @"@ . They were replied @: "@ where are you going then if you are hutu ? @" <EOS>
I told an Interahamwe beside me that I was hutu as well . <EOS>
He showed me where to stand if I was hutu . When they were distracted , I went back into the house . They carried those people away and none of them was seen back . <EOS>
General was there . That is what I had to say . Thank you . <EOS>
May you come back so that we may ask you ? Do you remember the number of the people taken away ? <EOS>
They were about 300 . Their names are too many that ... <EOS>
Who do you remember ? <EOS>
Ladies such as Donathile ; Immacule , Vianney 's wife , there were very many . I knew all of them .... <EOS>
Introduce yourself first <EOS>
My name is Nyirinkwaya ...... <EOS>
Parents ? <EOS>
Nsanzimana martin and Kankindi Anastasie <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear @: I ... <EOS>
I Nyirinkwaya Geoffrey , <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
Tell us <EOS>
I will n't say a lot . I will talk about some places evoked by people before me @: <EOS>
CELA . It does not mean that I do n't know what happened at Sainte @-@ Famille . I just want to talk about the attack headed by this very man Munyakazi at Cela <EOS>
Actually , Tutsis from Kiyovu , Kimicanga and Muhima had all gathered at Cela <EOS>
because it was a place where they thought they could be safe . We arrived and spent four days there . I do n't know the dates . You may ask Munyakazican because he participated in attacks and entered there . <EOS>
We spent about four days . On the second day , young men who were there , we thought of establishing self @-@ defense system against Interahamwe <EOS>
so that they might not easily invade . The formed self @-@ defense group was made of Albert , the chief , <EOS>
Gihana , Makombe , and others whose I do not remember names . <EOS>
The group was so strong that we beat the first Interahamwe 's attack . At the second time beat them as well . <EOS>
We were no longer afraid . We hanged on the entrance wall and the following one the timetable for watching in turns to ensure everybody 's security . <EOS>
After being severely defeated , the Interahamwe went to resort to a higher security level . You know well it was headed by the very Munyakazi who even headed the following attack . This shows he had been called upon by them . <EOS>
When they came , they were with this man , Renzaho Tharcisse , Angelina and many others I do not remember well . People who are here know and remember them . <EOS>
They came hitting everything . There were about 1000 Interahamwe I guess . They were really strong and armed with machetes ... with everything <EOS>
People who were frightened suggested not to fight since if we fought , we would all be killed . Otherwise , in case we did not , women and children would survive . <EOS>
We went and approached our chief aside and let Munyakazi , Renzaho and others get in . they passed through between Cela buildings . You can see the corridor yourself <EOS>
They went past the first house , reached the second which was seemingly a chapel , where some were hiding . <EOS>
Others were in a guava garden . They told all people to come to the upper side . Munyakazi himself gave the order of closing the upper path . They started cutting down the bush on the upper side in order to see who might be hiding there . <EOS>
We gathered . Everyone was taken from the hideaway . Renzaho said @: "@ there are now only Tutsis . Shoot at them @"@ . <EOS>
This one said to wait lest there should be hutus among them . I ask him to remember ; he said that instead of being killed together they should be killed according to their residence places . <EOS>
"@ Muhima here , Kimicanga , upper Kiyovu , lower Kiyovu @"@ , he himself pronounced those words . He said that people should be killed . He used those words . <EOS>
All people gathered according to their regions or sectors of origin . I , my two elder brothers , my cousin and few other people did not have any group to belong to . <EOS>
Renzaho asked @: "@ where do these belong to ? @" we answered @: "@ we are visitors from Kibungo . We do not have reason to enter any of the groups . Integrate us wherever you like . You may kill or save us @" <EOS>
"@ There is no Kibungo 's group unfortunately ! @" we were answered . Munyakazi told us @: "@ stay here @"@ . Our chief Albert , Degode , Wilson , and children of one man who lived in Kiyovu were killed there . <EOS>
Because their mother had been interviewed for a long time , she begged to be told to call the father if they wanted him and have her children saved . <EOS>
The mother went down to call her husband where he was hiding behind a cupboard . No sooner had they arrived than this one and his men took them and killed the whole family there . <EOS>
That one started killing people like that at everyone 's sight with a cruel torture in Cela <EOS>
Someone called .... has been asked and did not dare say it but this man in front of you headed the attack at Cela . <EOS>
For the sake of reliable information collection , in case he feels I am not telling the truth , I would beg him to come and say for example : @"@ this and this is not true or I did not arrive there @"@ ... <EOS>
He was fully there ! He watched the death of people , he gave suggestions holding pistol when the Interahamwe were doing their best to exterminate people , Tutsis . <EOS>
Just after Degode , Wilson , Gihana , Vincent who was a judge were killed , <EOS>
This very man ordered that the people gathered in sectors and cells be taken away to be killed . <EOS>
Munyakazi himself , as you see him in front of you , wore his trousers far below the waist , very proudly , believing himself to be the Almighty <EOS>
They took the people to CND to kill them and we stayed standing there as my colleague has just said . <EOS>
After they took and killed them there , I and one of my elder brothers were told to stand aside . But my oldest brother who was a driver <EOS>
and my cousin they worked together thought that because Renzaho was from Kibungo , he would save them . So they went to him . <EOS>
They went to that side . I and my elder brother stayed with this man . There was also another called Antoinet . They told us @: "@ join those Interahamwe @"@ . <EOS>
That was actually a way of delivering us to them . Fortunately , we went through the entrance of Cela , we went and arrived among displaced people at Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
When we joined those displaced people who were in Sainte @-@ Famille , they all moved away from me because I was easily remarkable . I mean ... among the wanted . <EOS>
Both Tutsis and Hutus left me alone on the yard so that I might be caught . <EOS>
I thought that instead of betraying others I should stay and be taken from there . <EOS>
It was about 10 or 11 a.m. People were being taken away one after one , slowly by slowly . I was still with my brother . <EOS>
The following day , I was the only one to survive among the security group . Others were killed in my eyes like yours who did such a work . <EOS>
The following day , this one came and entered Sainte @-@ Famille church . The Interahamwe also came with the list we had made in Cela in order to find who might be still alive . <EOS>
This one entered as to go to the priest 's . He was accompanied by Interahamwe who had swords and machetes rubbed with blood . It was in everyone 's sight . They had all necessary tools to kill <EOS>
They called @: "@ Nyirinkwaya @"@ ... First they called Albert @: "@ is Albert around ? @" He was n't . "@ Gihana ? @" He was n't . Then they called my name <EOS>
I thought @: @"@ this is my end now . Let me just go @"@ . I put off my coat and my watch ; I gave them to my elder brother so to keep them and I decided to go . <EOS>
Luckily one of the Interahamwe , Faustin , said @: "@ we have absolutely killed all these Inyenzi ! @" they called another who came after me on the list . His name was Makombe . He is also here right now , he can give you his testimony <EOS>
He was the fourth to be called and I was the third . Because they had just thought we all died , we survived that way . <EOS>
This man Munyakazi , himself , headed the attacks at Cela . He is responsible for the death of those people . Absolutely ! I saw these things with my own eyes . I even have more . <EOS>
There are men namely Rutabana who said that he killed people at Sainte @-@ Famille . Yes , he [ Munyakazi ] once came and found me sitting where I used to sit -@ people moved any time I would sit near them @- <EOS>
I was sitting like this . He held the coat I was wearing like this , and told me to go out . All people murmured @: "@ the guy is finished now ! Absolutely ! @" <EOS>
At that time I decided to go to cook porridge where the Interahamwe often passed so to be caught from a public place instead of betraying others . <EOS>
If he can remember where porridge was cooked , I was the cook . So , ladies and gentlemen , that is what I had to talk about this man . Thank you <EOS>
I would also like to beg him as a Rwandan that has understood unity and reconciliation , to show me where my elder brothers were thrown so that I may worthily bury them . Thank you ladies and gentlemen <EOS>
We want you to be brief <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear @: I , your name <EOS>
I , Munyankore martin <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
Swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
Tell us <EOS>
Martin The first testimony I want to give you dates back to 1991 <EOS>
martin In October 1990 when Inkotanyi started the war , the sector councilor Odette was an acquaintance of mine . Then the time of "@ Rwigema 's burial @" arrived . Banana stems were brought to us so that we bury them . All of us I mean <EOS>
She came to me and asked @: "@ why have n't you joined others to bury our enemy ? @"@ I answered her @: "@ he is not my enemy @" <EOS>
She asked again @: "@ do you mean you will n't come ? @" I answered @: "@ definitely ; I will n't @"@ . She told the cell leader @: "@ I do n't want to see this man when I am back @"@ . I got arrested . There was a soldier who was a friend of mine . He took me back when we arrived at Six @-@ Heures <EOS>
After taking me back , <EOS>
Please Martin , we would like to go straight to ..... <EOS>
I am almost on it . I will n't be too long actually . So the matter was closed . <EOS>
Martin In 1994 after the death of Habyarimana the killings started . I had a son , Kagame who was already murdered . <EOS>
We went to Sainte @-@ Famille . Munyakazi and MINUAR were there . They said @: "@ because people have come to join Inyenzi , let 's make a list of those who are joining the government 's side and those on the Inyenzi 's @"@ . <EOS>
They told us to write our names and the side we wanted to go to . Some refused . I told my colleagues that it probably intended to abduct us . <EOS>
We committed to solving the problem . There was a woman close to MINUAR . She told them [ MINUAR ] but they did not know the intention of Munyakazi and Father Munyeshyaka <EOS>
The would @-@ be father . These thought that we wanted to pass through her and MINUAR so it might systematically transport those who wanted to go RPF . <EOS>
During the two days I had been abducted twice and people with me had paid for my ransom . <EOS>
One gendarme once took me and told me @: "@ for this time , come @"@ . I asked him @: @"@ where are you taking me brother ? @" He replied @: "@ you already know where you are usually taken @"@ . I thought that was actually my end . <EOS>
People gave money . Some of them are even here . On that day , the lists arrived back from MINUAR . Munyakazi had been with the Father all the day <EOS>
talking . They said that people should be observed and put into their categories ; tall ones ... The young priest Father Munyeshyaka -@ I do n't master his names ! Sometimes I am likely to .... <EOS>
Okay ! Then Father Munyeshyaka with this man said @: "@ follow this order ; separate tall people from others @"@ . <EOS>
On that day , they had been holding a meeting all the day . Father Munyeshyaka came wearing a bullet @-@ proof holding a pistol . When he was celebrating the mass and moved like this the pistol fell down . <EOS>
When it fell down we wondered @: "@ who is this guy reading the word of God with a gun that that has started falling down ! Will n't he shoot at us in the church ? @" <EOS>
I had been there for few days . I had failed to arrive before . Finally MINUAR said that the lists had to be drawn again and that selection would take place at the football playground <EOS>
according to an alphabetic order . The first section was brought to Kabuga . <EOS>
There were eight Gatete 's on the list . When they reached them , I thought my name will n't be read when I am still alive because I had been abducted from time to time . I decided to answer under the name of Gatete . <EOS>
Arrived outside .... By the way ; I had five children , mine and my sister 's , who had just died . I was with this man and the other lady....Odette . <EOS>
They said @: "@ make sure Munyentwali does not escape . Can you imagine someone who called his son Kagame ? Can you imagine that ? He even refused to go to Rwigema 's burial saying he was not an enemy . By the way , you , sector councilor , why have kept such a person till today ? @" <EOS>
It was on the playground . I was about to get on the truck . This man and Munyeshyaka refused absolutely . It became a great dispute . Finally , MINUAR took me away by force . <EOS>
Those who stayed at Sainte @-@ Famille were killed after we left . I was at Kabuga . That was my testimony . <EOS>
We were together for thirty minutes during the dispute with MINUAR when I was getting on board . How can he be denying all these things ? <EOS>
He was preventing you from getting on board ? <EOS>
He and Munyeshyaka . They said that I had to stay because I was not on the list . They checked the list and found out that I had a different name . I had my identity card with me . They refused saying that I should wait for my turn and I could be alive till that time . <EOS>
I had already been abducted for five times . People paid for my ransom . I was only abducted by gendarmes . No Interahamwe did . <EOS>
Did you see this one getting in Sainte @-@ Famille when you were still there ? <EOS>
You mean this one ? He was there with ... the Father , his partner . <EOS>
You can go <EOS>
Say your name first ! <EOS>
I , Nkusi Antoine swear to God that what I am going to say is true . <EOS>
What I am going to say about Munyakazi is true . <EOS>
On the 7th we escaped to ..... We spent many days there . I will n't say much of him . <EOS>
My colleague already said it and we were together <EOS>
We were even in the same group <EOS>
but we were dispersed by this man and his men . <EOS>
I think , they started by cutting down the bush on priests ' fields . <EOS>
They first came cutting down the bushes . He was with Renzaho <EOS>
and Nyirabagenzi . They were always together . <EOS>
We were hiding and had been gathered together , this man observed <EOS>
and realized that people of his ethnic group would also die with us in case we were all killed . <EOS>
He said @: "@ put them in groups according to their cells of origin @"@ . It was done as such . <EOS>
Some were packed into the car . Among those Rwanga and his children . <EOS>
He is responsible for all of that because he did it there . After some time we left the place <EOS>
covering our heads with mattresses . Some went to Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
Fortunately we arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille . He was always there . <EOS>
Because people have already talked about it , I want to be brief and ask him one thing ; <EOS>
to show us the eighteen people he took away or , if he killed them , <EOS>
to show us their bodies so to worthily bury them . That 's it . <EOS>
Thank you ! My name is Safari , Rugenge sector , <EOS>
Nyarugenge district , Kigali city . What I have realized about this man , Munyakazi .... <EOS>
I , Safari Hamoud , swear to God that what I am going to say is true <EOS>
What I have realized about this man , Munyakazi is that he is contradicting himself <EOS>
as far as 1990 and 2005 are concerned . <EOS>
One might say he is adjusting his position to Vision 2020 ! <EOS>
Though he has been denying the red car , he actually traveled in it in 1994 . <EOS>
I saw him myself . I heard him myself talking to Interahamwe among them Maroc , <EOS>
Kavurivundi and...who were on the road . <EOS>
He looked out of the window and told them @: "@ what is wrong ? There is no shit here ! @" <EOS>
The Interahamwe answered him @: "@ we have no tools @" <EOS>
He replied @: "@ how come that you do n't ? @" He looked out of the window again and talked to the gendarmes in the boot . <EOS>
He told them @: "@ provide them with tools @"@ . They immediately gave them grenades . I wonder how the shit had to be removed with grenades ! <EOS>
Was that a wheelbarrow to remove the shit ? <EOS>
After being supplied by him , they entered my aunt 's house where I was staying . <EOS>
They met me the first . They told me to stand on my knees . They told me @: " say your last pray because you are going to die ! @" <EOS>
I stood on my knees and say my prayer in Arabic . They said @: "@ this one is talking to Kagame in their language @"@ . <EOS>
They told me @: "@ speak any other language you like @" <EOS>
Kavurivundi told me @: "@ pray our Father @" <EOS>
I did not know Our Father and I mixed it with Hail Mary . <EOS>
Another called David , beat me with a machete in my back . <EOS>
The Interahamwe called Maroc saw me and remembered that we used to play together at Kimihurura . <EOS>
He said @: @"@ this boy is not an Inyenzi . We used to play together at Kimihurura . <EOS>
I never saw him involved in such things @"@ . <EOS>
He held the grenade given to him by Munyakazi . He told them @: "@ if you kill him , I send you to hell with this grenade . I swear ! @" <EOS>
They were frightened and left me . I do n't understand why Munyakazi is standing here <EOS>
and denies that he travelled in the red car , that he supplied the Interahamwe <EOS>
whereas I watched him supplying them . That was my testimony <EOS>
My names are Mukangarambe Domithile , daughter of Buyenge and Mukamuganga Anastasia <EOS>
I was born in 1949 <EOS>
Cell of birth ? <EOS>
Muyange cell . I am going to give you my testimony <EOS>
Raise your right hand and swear <EOS>
I , Mukangarambe Domithile , swear to God that what I am going to say is true <EOS>
The testimony I want to give to you is that this man Munyakazi ... First he held a meeting . He was with Odette . <EOS>
In the meeting , they told people to destroy Tutsis ' houses so that their sons might have steel sheets to cover their houses . <EOS>
After the meeting people came downhill . There was an old man of my neighborhood called Charles Kabendegeri who <EOS>
came to my door and started sharpening a machete . <EOS>
A man called Emmanuel arrived and asked him @: "@ do you still have meat given cows have finished ? @" He replied @: "@ you already know my meat , man ! @"@ . <EOS>
He pointed at me and said @: "@ it is as if traitors who are here have not heard what the Gendarmerie commander has told us @: <EOS>
that we must get rid of these traitors @"@ . Something else I want to say about Munyakazi concerns the people he is denying . <EOS>
I mean one hundred eighty @-@ six of Sainte @-@ Famille <EOS>
They were put on MINITRAP 's truck . <EOS>
They drove them down to Kiyovu . <EOS>
Munyakazi was in a red car though he is denying it . <EOS>
He came with a driver from the gendarmerie called Murindwa <EOS>
who was my neighbor . He arrived asking whether there were not tutsi shit . <EOS>
They were laughing . One could see even people in the MINITRAP 's truck boot . <EOS>
That is the time when I saw him talking to their driver Murindwa . <EOS>
They turned back the truck . The car of this one followed it . He was asking @: "@ is n't there any shit here ? @" <EOS>
Others could reply @: "@ when we kill , we immediately bury ! We do not need help ! @" <EOS>
Who said that "@ When we kill , we immediately bury . We do not need help ! @"@ ? <EOS>
The Interahamwe who were there . Murindwa also said it . <EOS>
He told them to get on the truck and he followed them . Only he knows where he carried them . <EOS>
I saw him again when the gendarmerie headquarters was captured by Inkotanyi . He came to see Murindwa and told him to go and carry soldiers <EOS>
having lost their legs . Those who were dead were carried to Gisenyi to be buried . <EOS>
I saw him again coming to Murindwa 's house . He said @: "@ I think the Inyenzi are beating us now ! @" <EOS>
Is Murindwa alive ? <EOS>
No. He is dead ! <EOS>
I can n't imagine why he is defending himself whereas he used to come to people 's homes to hold meetings . <EOS>
I did not even know that his name was Munyakazi . <EOS>
He used to come with Nyirabagenzi and others to hold meetings . <EOS>
I can n't imagine why he says he was not involved in killings <EOS>
whereas he is the one to have sensitized people about the presence of Inyenzi ! <EOS>
That is what I had to talk about him according to what I saw . <EOS>
Let 's start by Gisimba Damas <EOS>
My names are Mutezintare Gisimba Damas son of Gisimba and Mukamanzi Dancile <EOS>
It is the matter of testimony and point of view because the gentleman cited you as a witness <EOS>
I think it will be a point of view since I was not in all places he has cited . I was at Saint @-@ Michel <EOS>
Be brief . You only have three minutes <EOS>
Briefly , I met him during the war . <EOS>
I was at Nyamirambo , in my orphanage <EOS>
There were many displaced children because there had been an orphanage for a long time . <EOS>
Many children having lost their parents escaped there . There are even those who were killed there . <EOS>
The war was very cruel ; the Interahamwe often attacked us but failed to harm us . <EOS>
Try to be quick , Mister Gisimba <EOS>
Something important I did is that I hid people <EOS>
with the help of a white person who worked in an American organization . <EOS>
They did their best and helped us to escape to Saint @-@ Michel . <EOS>
The operation to displace people was carried out by Major Karangwa <EOS>
He and about four gendarmes took us from Nyamirambo . <EOS>
We went to Saint @-@ Michel . Once Munyakazi came there . <EOS>
he came , observed and did not say a thing . <EOS>
We were hosted by Father Karibushi , the then parish priest . <EOS>
He had first hesitated and I told him @: "@ these are displaced people of mine . Remember the vow you made to God ! <EOS>
All people are your sheep . These are mine I put within your hands . <EOS>
They are yours as well @"@ . I did not see him anymore . Soldiers abruptly got in . <EOS>
Soldiers not gendarmes ! They were soldiers because they were staying in front of staff headquarters . <EOS>
They came asking many questions . I introduced my self . They said they wanted to take older children to Lycée Notre Dame . <EOS>
I resisted because I could see that they wanted to trick me in order to kill them . <EOS>
I could n't see in Lycée Notre Dame anything that would separate me from the children . <EOS>
I went on tricking them till they were all confused and gave up . <EOS>
During those days we arrived , Interahamwe killed none of mine or displaced people . <EOS>
No one was killed by Interahamwe at Saint @-@ Michel <EOS>
Do you mean that no one died at Saint @-@ Michel ? <EOS>
No one died when I was there . We stayed there for very few days , <EOS>
then Inkotanyi found us there on 4th and many soldiers were escaping on the 3rd . <EOS>
Things did not ... we started planning to take the way of Kiyovu and run away . <EOS>
The following day in the morning , about 4 , I went out . <EOS>
I found RPF soldiers who wore differently . <EOS>
They saw me , called me and asked me who I am . I told them . They told me to go back <EOS>
That 's fine . We only wanted to know whether people did not die there or ... <EOS>
Do you have any other information to give us ? <EOS>
No people died there ! <EOS>
Introduce yourself <EOS>
My names are Gatete François . I was born in Kibuye . I am the son of Gashonga and Mukabashinga Fayini . <EOS>
I , Gatete François , swear to God <EOS>
That what I am going to say is true <EOS>
I am going to talk about General Munyakazi who is in front of us . <EOS>
I will talk about what happened in1990 because I do n't know much about 1994 <EOS>
I want to talk about the former prefect of Kibuye , Donatien <EOS>
who , he is telling us , was among the officers he commanded in Ruhengeri . <EOS>
He is saying that he got the information that Kabera Assiel and MP Donatien Ruhima <EOS>
were wrongfully accusing him . I am talking as someone who fully knows him @: <EOS>
Major General sitting here behind . <EOS>
Those two men were misfortunate and beaten <EOS>
at Nyamirambo stadium . He wanted to evoke them because of what he did to them . <EOS>
He and his gendarmes had a group of Interahamwe . <EOS>
I will n't talk about his actions . He is responsible for their death before the heavenly God . <EOS>
Assiel I have just evoked died of wounds . He had been shot at there at Nyamirambo . <EOS>
He was cruelly tortured . Maybe someone will talk about it . <EOS>
He and others with him only took porridge . Once , this man and his group of <EOS>
Interahamwe and gendarmes prohibited that they be given the porridge anymore . <EOS>
They could put off their shoes and take the porridge with them . <EOS>
I ensure you , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , <EOS>
that only Assiel himself would tell the Munyakazi 's deeds if he was alive . <EOS>
Fortunately for him he died . Assiel 's death shocked me . He pitifully died . <EOS>
Munyakazi himself says that he is wrongfully accused by Kabera Assiel and MP Donatien . <EOS>
I would like to ask you to investigate about Assiel 's death or ... <EOS>
because it was a pitiful one . We people from Kibuye , have not understood it yet . <EOS>
There are different rumors outside there . Fortunately we 've just had one to ask . <EOS>
Kabera Assiel died with rotten feet because of Major General Munyakazi ! <EOS>
Donatie was his brother . <EOS>
I would like to let him know that Kabera Assiel 's father and Donatien 's <EOS>
parents are our family members . So , saying that people from Kibuye ..... <EOS>
I would like to ask gacaca courts to study the case of 1990's survivors <EOS>
who were here at Nyamirambo , who were beaten and tortured . <EOS>
To be brief ... He worked in finance . He was a very important person . <EOS>
.... I do n't know what to say about the Major General . May God consider his case ! <EOS>
I may only tell you that we have failed to understand Kabera Assiel 's death . <EOS>
But now that we know he had been told that there was someone secretly hunting him , <EOS>
that he [ Munyakazi ] jailed Donatien till he was shot at without having given such a testimony at least , <EOS>
that we did not know how he was shot to death , Major General shall have to pay that . We will go to all tribunals to accuse him of that ! <EOS>
My names are Rwanyange Robert , my father is Rwanyange Aloys and my mother Marie . <EOS>
I , Rwanyange Robert , swear to God that what I am going to say is true . <EOS>
People have been talking about the Colonel 's actions . We were at Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux . <EOS>
The place has been evoked many times and was one of places he had to control . <EOS>
Actually on 30th , around 8 , they came there to abduct people . <EOS>
Men were separated from women . Then the survivors , we escaped <EOS>
We went to ... on April 30th 1994 , <EOS>
Those who were lucky to survive , we went to hide in a small forest that was there . <EOS>
Around 10 or 11 , Munyakazi with gendarmes came to Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux . <EOS>
They called people and some including me kept hiding . <EOS>
Some women were discovered where they were hiding because it was very near . <EOS>
After some time , Munyakazi could even call @: "@ show yourselves ! Show yourselves ! <EOS>
I am lieutenant @-@ colonel @"@ . We had not even recognized him before . <EOS>
Those who thought we would get killed if we showed ourselves , we stayed there . <EOS>
Some desperate mothers , I guess , went and showed themselves . <EOS>
They went to meet this man . They told him that people had been killed there . He already knew and that is why he was coming . <EOS>
He knew that people were killed and told us @: "@ do not worry , your people are safe @"@ . <EOS>
They had been taken through one path that goes down from Lycée in order to be killed somewhere else . <EOS>
They told him @: "@ we know they died @"@ . He replied @: "@ do not worry ! Nothing bad happened to them ! @"@ . <EOS>
I knew that they were dead . So , I would like to ask him to tell us about their death . <EOS>
That is all of my testimony . <EOS>
What are your names again ? How old were you ? <EOS>
A list of people who died at Lycée is available . <EOS>
I wonder if I could have it . They were about 18 when getting registered . <EOS>
We are asking you about your relatives ! <EOS>
There were many people including my elder brother <EOS>
What is his name ? <EOS>
Abel <EOS>
What about friends ? <EOS>
Mwumvaneza , Kagorora André , a lady called Grace and many others . <EOS>
There was Rugaba as well . <EOS>
Many people were taken from there . I would like to learn about our people 's death in Lycée <EOS>
My names are Jean Bosco . I was born in former Gishoma commune <EOS>
Tell us your parents ' names first . <EOS>
My father is Onesphore . I , Mwisesneza Jean Bosco , swear to God that what I am going to say is true . <EOS>
I do not know much of this man but I saw him on 20th <EOS>
June at Saint @-@ Paul . When Inkotanyi came to take people over there I was unlucky to stay there with other few people . <EOS>
We stayed there with someone whose deeds should be highly exalted ! <EOS>
His name was Léonard . He was a watchman at Saint @-@ Paul . I remember that , once Interahamwe attacked saying they wanted people who stayed there , <EOS>
Léonard put me into a hole . He told me that he thought I would be killed by this one . <EOS>
I was saved by him . He was a watchman . Many people know him . <EOS>
Léonard could tell me everything because I could not go out . <EOS>
On 20th , it was said that gendarmes who guarded Saint @-@ Paul would no longer stay . <EOS>
They would be transferred . By the way , I stayed because someone <EOS>
who was a guard at Rugenge sector 's office had advised me not to . We knew each other from early childhood . <EOS>
We were found where we used to hide the day people were abducted from Saint @-@ Paul . <EOS>
He was with ... you have heard of him . <EOS>
He had told me not to move because an order had been given ; to kill people who shifted from Saint @-@ Paul to Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
I stayed there that night . Interahamwe kept coming to rob in Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
because people had left rushing and lost their stuffs there . <EOS>
I was there every single night they came for robbery . <EOS>
Once I went asleep <EOS>
and around 4 a.m bullet shots awakened me ; <EOS>
people of Sainte @-@ Famille were being killed . <EOS>
I had already been warned by the gendarme . I was in Saint @-@ Paul center conference room . <EOS>
I saw Munyakazi once in my life . This is my second time to see him . <EOS>
I could only see him in a car . I had never come close to him . <EOS>
On 20th , when we were ordered by Interahamwe to go to Sainte @-@ Famille , <EOS>
Munyakazi joined the Interahamwe who stationed on Saint @-@ Paul yard . <EOS>
There was a barrier set by the Interahamwe near a kiosk that was there . <EOS>
They wanted to kill me there . I felt some courage and thought to beg this man 's help ; <EOS>
I said @: "@ I am innocent . You should rather be fighting Inyenzi who are at Kicukiro and elsewhere <EOS>
but not be killing Hutus , your blood , at Sainte @-@ Famille ! @" He said @: "@ watch out guys ! This one was in the car . He never got off ! @" <EOS>
He asked me @: "@ hey you , are you hutu ? @" I answered @: "@ Yes I am hutu @"@ . He asked again @: "@ where do you come from ? @" <EOS>
I did not answer him because I knew that being hutu <EOS>
born of Gishoma deserved death as well . <EOS>
"@ I am from Kimbogo ; Bucyana and Bigoli were from our village @"@ . <EOS>
The two communes , Gishoma and Kimbogo were very close to each other <EOS>
I said the two men were my uncles . This man ordered to release me . <EOS>
The Interahamwe accompanied me to Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
I thought @: "@ if I reveal my names and origin , I will get killed @"@ . <EOS>
What I thought was actually true . I went to Sainte @-@ Famille and took the name of Ntezirya . <EOS>
Republican Guards could sometimes come there and say that they were sent by their chief . I never knew who it was . <EOS>
I saw the Republican Guards coming to Sainte @-@ Famille but I never knew what they were coming for ; <EOS>
they only said they were coming to look for people who had been at Saint @-@ Paul . <EOS>
I always prayed God . Luckily the Inkotanyi arrived at Sainte @-@ Famille <EOS>
and saved us . That is what I can remember about Munyakazi <EOS>
Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux @: on April 30th 1994 , the day this man has just evoked . <EOS>
It is true that extremist soldiers who were in staff headquarters went to Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux <EOS>
because they were supposed to control the area . A battalion was appointed to control the area . What he said , that nuns called Father Karibushi on phone is true as well ; <EOS>
They told him what was taking place . Karibushi called me because I controlled the area of Saint @-@ Paul cathedral . <EOS>
You should also tell us who participated in those attacks and killed people , Sir ! <EOS>
I told you they were soldiers from staff headquarters as well as the Interahamwe . They went to take people who were here on April 30th , <EOS>
1994 <EOS>
You should tell us the names of those you knew because this is testimony . <EOS>
I can not know them . Nuns said that they saw soldiers entering their house . I was called by Father Karibushi asking to give them gendarmes to protect them though Lycee Notre Dame was not within my area . <EOS>
Those nuns were actually attacked by soldiers as I said it . I left Muhima <EOS>
to Lycee Notre Dame de Citeaux . On that day , I met the nuns and I gave gendarmes to them <EOS>
I ordered Captain ... to appoint gendarmes to protect Lycee Notre Dame de Citeaux . <EOS>
I was just asked where those soldiers and Interahamwe took them . I do n't know . <EOS>
They called me for help and I helped them . I guess there is nothing bad in it . <EOS>
As far as the attack at Cela is concerned , I think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ? <EOS>
He just said that he arrived at Cela on April 7th . <EOS>
What about the attack of April 22nd ? <EOS>
Yes , those attacks at Cela took place and were headed by Interahamwe . That is true but I never headed the Interamwe 's attacks . <EOS>
Did you hear of that attack of April 22nd which cost lives of people , Sir ? <EOS>
People who were at Cela moved to Saint @-@ Paul center and we protected them there . <EOS>
Do you agree that there are those who survived at Cela and moved to Saint @-@ Paul where you protected them ? <EOS>
Yes I do agree that there were people who escaped from Cela by jumping over walls . However , I did not head that Interahamwe 's attack . That is all I can add . <EOS>
What do I think about the red car all people have been insisting on ? <EOS>
I think I even started with it , saying that I never travelled in that car ! <EOS>
I never travelled in that car at all as people are saying . <EOS>
I absolutely reject that I travelled in that red car . Never ! <EOS>
Maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel Munyakazi ! <EOS>
But I never used it . <EOS>
Please Sir ; there are people who say you travelled in that car for humanitarian actions . What do you say ? <EOS>
During genocide it was used by others but <EOS>
you had yours somewhere not far ! <EOS>
The car never got to ... I never travelled near it . <EOS>
Never ! Concerning the groups that killed people in Kigali ; <EOS>
they were many . There were Interahamwe as we 've been saying . The last one has just evoked Republican Guards who used to come where he was . <EOS>
There were even many intelligence agents employed by other authorities . <EOS>
So Munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes ! <EOS>
You should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel ! <EOS>
I should be asked about what happened in my area @: Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . <EOS>
Gisimba has even told you that all people who arrived with him and those he found there survived . <EOS>
Had the groups entered Saint @-@ Michel cathedral , I would tell you their names . <EOS>
But the other area was controlled by Nyarugenge territory company as I have already told the court . The groups were MRND , CDR under the staff command <EOS>
Who abducted people ? Those groups of killers must be responsible for it . I , Lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi , was not commanding those groups . <EOS>
The accusations about what happened at Saint @-@ André brought against me are all wrong as well . <EOS>
The accusations are wrong ones . I never arrived there . I only arrived at Fathers ' house . I was with Major Ngirabatware . <EOS>
After the killing of eight Brothers , Father Blanchal called Ngirabatware asking him that we might go to carry brothers who were with him . <EOS>
We first went to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . We then went to carry them . We brought the first group to Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . <EOS>
You may ask Father Blanchal and those Brothers . <EOS>
Gendarmes went to bring the second group that was still at Nyamirambo . <EOS>
They brought them to Hotel de Mille Collines and Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . You can ask the question to Father Blanchal . <EOS>
I never headed any attack against Saint @-@ Michel or his parish <EOS>
Please sir , remember your duty was to protect the population and I can realize that you mainly concentrated your efforts on priests and brothers . <EOS>
Why did you forget other people who were being killed because of their ethnic group ? <EOS>
We actually saved many people . The only problem is that even someone I carried in my car denies it when he arrives here ! <EOS>
However , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned . <EOS>
I am telling you that all priests who were in Kigali are alive . All priests and brothers who were in the area of Plateau are alive <EOS>
No one died and all were saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel Munyakazi but once you save man and he comes here to accuse you as I have just seen it here . <EOS>
Please sir , you have seen yourself people who have been here to say something . They have not been appointed by the court . We do not even now them . <EOS>
I think you only know two people from Rugenge . However we can ensure you that the witnesses were not appointed by the court in order to accuse you . <EOS>
We can not even dictate people what to say . You have seen that they even gave different experiences . <EOS>
In addition , you asked to come and give the testimony on your own initiative and the administration only convened people <EOS>
We have come just as court agents to listen to your testimony . Our questions are based on what people have said . <EOS>
We want to ensure you about that . <EOS>
There are a lot of things about the meetings you held in Rugenge . So , ... <EOS>
The meetings , going outside and say there was no shit , supplying killers ... can you imagine as an authority having gendarmes under your command ! ... <EOS>
Concerning destroying houses in Kigali , I think you can see it yourself that areas controlled by gendarmes were safe . Saint @-@ Michel cathedral was not destroyed , <EOS>
Sainte @-@ Famille was not , Saint @-@ Paul was not <EOS>
Hotel Mille Collines was not as well . Saying I sensitized about destroying houses is just a lie . <EOS>
This is not a debate Sir . The houses in the areas were not destroyed that is true . Let 's consider people who died because man is more than houses . Houses are built but man passes away once for all . <EOS>
Houses were not destroyed but many people died . You have yourself heard of saint @-@ Paul 's and Cela 's events , <EOS>
those of Saint @-@ Paul , Sainte @-@ Famille ... you know it yourself and all people do . Why did you deploy your men there ? <EOS>
Was it to protect houses after having failed to protect people ? I would like you to explain it to us . <EOS>
The group under my command protected people at Saint @-@ Michel cathedral . You should ask me to explain what happened there if any problem arose at Saint @-@ Paul cathedral or Sainte @-@ Famille church controlled by gendarmes as I told you . <EOS>
Nyarugenge territory company , Kigali formation and Interahamwe attacked the institutions . <EOS>
Someone also o evoked Kabera 's death . I did never participate in his killing . <EOS>
I did not evoke him before because on March 1st 1995 , <EOS>
he and others were at Saint @-@ Paul ... at Lycée ... Saint @-@ Paul center ... Sainte @-@ Famille church ... with MP Rugema . It was in that time people say I took 13 people and carried them in a pickup . They even published it ; I read it . People from Kibuye even established a commission <EOS>
which had to investigate about those men 's rumors . I already explained it . But I tell you that I am not among people who shot at Kabera . <EOS>
Investigators have to run the enquiries but I was not among the shooters . <EOS>
Let 's go over to ... <EOS>
Thank you mister President , thank you all gacaca court panel members . I have asked to speak as one of the people who were at Cela . I arrived there on 7th . <EOS>
My names are Kanzayire Bernadette . I am not giving a testimony . I want to have some explanations from our brother General Munyakazi . <EOS>
As it was said , I was at Cela . On 22nd , the place was attacked and all people escaped to Sainte @-@ Famille <EOS>
And Saint @-@ Paul . I lived in all those places . Munyakazi said that he was in charge of the mobile group . <EOS>
He also said gave some orders to gendarmes who were at Sainte @-@ Famille , Saint @-@ Paul and elsewhere . <EOS>
He said that he gave orders to territory company men because their commander could not be there . e Member of audience This means that those men were just executing orders . I think that General Munyakazi should be responsible for everything they might have done since he had taken the responsibility to gave orders to them . <EOS>
Furthermore , in his testimony he did not say anything about the areas of Rugenge and Muhima . <EOS>
He only talked about Saint @-@ Michel and Hotel de Mille Collines . I have wondered why he has avoided talking about Sainte @-@ Famille , Saint @-@ Paul and Cela . <EOS>
He has talked about them after people did . He told us that he went to Saint @-@ Paul . There was a priest who was in charge of the center who helped us a lot . I even thank you , General Munyakazi , if the information we have been provided with is true ; <EOS>
that you facilitated Father Celestin to help us . He said he helped him to get water and food <EOS>
From CARITAS ' stores . However , why did n't he help him when Saint @-@ Paul was attacked ? <EOS>
He should have helped the only priest we could find because others were hiding . <EOS>
He would have helped us more like that . I would also like to ask him to tell us what he did when he went to Saint @-@ Paul @: to get food or whatever ... <EOS>
What he went there for ? Did n't he get any information from gendarmes who were there about people who had been killed there ? <EOS>
He was called for help but I heard that he arrived after people were already killed . <EOS>
In 1994 , young men were taken from rooms where they had escaped . <EOS>
The young men were about 60 . They were killed near the place . Lieutenant @-@ colonel knows it but he did not tell the court . <EOS>
How did he consider that , as someone who had given orders to gendarmes ? Mister president , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca panel , <EOS>
He gave orders as a military authority . <EOS>
It was an organ of the army and there is a way in which orders have to be executed within a military hierarchy <EOS>
What did he do mister president ? Thank you ! <EOS>
Remember that this is not a party so that we rejoice and clap our hands ! We only thank one for his good deeds . <EOS>
Many people died at Saint @-@ Paul and I think you already know that <EOS>
Remember you were an authority ; you had men , equipment and weapons to stop killers , who by the way , were not as trained as your men <EOS>
as far as preventing such catastrophes and lay people having been accidently armed ! You should also tell us about arming the population by the way ! <EOS>
There were many unities . I am going to pass through them as follows @: Rwandan army staff with generals here and then ; <EOS>
Gendarmerie staff which was in Kigali city ; Kigali operation command ; <EOS>
There were also .... A lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned , <EOS>
this implied fighting against the Interahamwe and taking Kigali formation to Kacyiru . We did not want it to go there <EOS>
rather stay here with twelve guards at Saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
Sorry to interrupt sir ! the question was about Saint @-@ Paul attacks <EOS>
and Sainte @-@ Famille . Among your responsibilities as an authority , you had the ability to stop the attacks and save lives of civilians <EOS>
who had escaped there because of their ethnic groups . We want you to tackle that issue . <EOS>
I am almost on it . There were twelve gendarmes at Saint @-@ Paul and twelve at Sainte @-@ Famille . <EOS>
There is one who said that people were abducted from Saint @-@ Paul in the eyes of gendarmes . What were they doing then ? <EOS>
I told you that the....entered to abduct people . <EOS>
I think that the abductors of people from Saint @-@ Paul and Sainte @-@ Famille should be asked questions on their own because I was never told that such @-@ and @-@ such went to abduct people . <EOS>
I would know it if they did it at Saint @-@ Michel . You have realized that the areas I controlled never experienced such problems . <EOS>
Why did you usually go there while it was not your area ? <EOS>
I told you that on 20th , in the morning , I went to saint @-@ Paul <EOS>
And Sainte @-@ Famille to see our gendarme who had died during an attack <EOS>
At Saint @-@ Paul . I also told you that I went to Saint @-@ Paul center after ... I was at Hotel de Mille Collines . <EOS>
What about those who were at SOPETRAD , former SOPECY I think ? <EOS>
There were battalion 61 gendarmes at SOPECYA . <EOS>
No gendarmes with villagers there ? <EOS>
I mean those who were with villagers on the barrier at SOPETRAD . <EOS>
No , there were no gendarmes there from SOPETRAD to Poids Lourd road . <EOS>
This was guarded by battalion 61 . <EOS>
There were no gendarmes on the barrier at all . <EOS>
Be seated please ! <EOS>
we have wished to have the long report so that we may learn more about this matter . <EOS>
We do not want to this to be too long and boring . He wants to say something before we close this cession . Can he ? <EOS>
But he should be very brief . <EOS>
I started by introducing myself . I entered ESM in 1973 . <EOS>
when those events broke out , I was lieutenant . The genocide of Tutsis started in 1959 . <EOS>
The genocide of tutsis was planned and implemented by the Government of Rwanda , <EOS>
the governments of Rwanda till 4th 1994 @: <EOS>
from 1 st 1990 till 31 st 1994 . <EOS>
I was never involved in genocide or any other crime against humanity . On the contrary , I did my best to help people <EOS>
in bad situations . However , when the government of Rwanda implemented carried out genocide , <EOS>
I was a state employee . <EOS>
Though I was not involved in genocide or any other crimes , I , Major General Munyakazi , do apologize <EOS>
for having been employed by the criminal government and governments that killed more than one million people in 1994 and that now I am being accused of those crimes . <EOS>
In February 1995 , in front of you all , <EOS>
I decided to separate from the criminal government that had exiled to Zaire <EOS>
And still planned to invade Rwanda in order to resume the genocide of Tutsis . <EOS>
On March 1st 1995 , <EOS>
Considering what I said on Radio Rwanda , some thought that I was for the Interahamwe 's side . <EOS>
On March 16th they went to report me to Criminology Department saying that Munyakazi 's testimony showed that he was for the Interahamwe , that he did not want to tell the truth . <EOS>
It was said that I might have worked with Colonel Renzaho . For that reason , they started bringing fake accusations against me . <EOS>
