We left the priest 's place . Two days later I remember it was on 14th [ June 1994 ] , that day was the worst day of my life . They took around 70 young men ; we counted them after everyone started to talk about those we knew among them . This time they came really serious , and searching each and every corner . The thing is when it is not your turn to die , then nothing happens to you . None of them did guess where we , I , Anselme and Dominique , used to hide . From where he hid , we continued to watch them what they were doing . They were tiring two by two using a shirt . I remember one of them ; this young man wrote on his high school diploma these words "@ I forgive my killers . @" He gave it to his mother , his mother lives now in a place called Kabasengerezi and she has it . He wrote on his diploma those words before he left . That time they took a large number of young men among which , Muyoboke Bosco , another one called Hategekimana also known as Nyarisaza , including Gasindi , another one called Twaha and another one called Mutarambirwa . Among those seventy people was included an old man called Murasadonyi who was one of the few old people that were taken . They were taken to be killed inside a man called Yaremye 's big building located in Kiyovu residence . They were buried inside that building . It was on 14th , the same day Kameya got killed . He was brought from Kinyamateka to be killed . <EOS>
They were proud of having killed Kameya saying that is now the turn for Lieutenants inside Saint Paul . "@ We hope to catch them @: @" they said . We were the ones called Lieutenants . Early in morning on 15th because of a large number of people who lost their lives , it was said that a lot of them came from Saint Paul . It was even announced on the radio . The united nations peace keepers [ MINUAR ] came and had a small meeting with us . They said @: "@ Do n't worry , write down your names we will pick you up tomorrow . @" The next day on the 16th they did not come . In the night , we left Saint Paul because we were told that we cause problems other refuges and we felt unsecured . We wanted to go to Gisozi hoping the lucky person will get there . <EOS>
We told the priest , he packed for us bread and gave us a guard to escort us . He said to us @: "@ He will go with you and will keep on informing you the location of barriers because he lives in Gisozi so he is used to cross those barriers . We left around 10 pm , when we reached in the small forest close to Saint Paul , we heard some people behind and they started to shoot on us . We ran back to where we came from . Before we went separate ways , Dominque said to me @: "@ Do you know what , let 's go back and we will leave the place tomorrow if the Inkotanyi do not come to rescue us , I have hope they will come to rescue . That is what happened , we went in separate places in order to sleep as we knew none of the interahamwe would attack in the night , they always attacked day time but we continued to hear gunfire increasing , within the gunfire I heard people coming and they said @: "@ Masengo it 's us inkoyanyi . @" They were calling Masengo , Tunga and Kariyopi , the reason those inkotanyi knew our names is because they are some people whom we were together in Saint Paul and were got rescued by the UN peace keepers [ MINUAR ] , so those people told those Inkotanyi about us . Among those people was one called Ndengeyingoma and another one called Musafiri , so those inkotanyi came to rescue us . <EOS>
They came saying , Masengo it 's us inkotanyi do n't worry ; come out of where you are . I thought it was Interahamwe trying to fool us so that they can take us . I tried to leave the place in order to hide in a nice place because I was feeling unsafe . I left the place around 2 am and while I was going out I heard them talking , but there was still a lot of gunfire outside . It was an exchange of gunfire between Inkotanyi and Interahamwe . I went down slowly and hid myself in a bush , I saw Ndengeyingoma in front of those soldiers calling me . I carefully looked at them , because I knew how Inkotanyi looked like . They were some of them I knew at CND and others I knew from military course I took . I came out of the bush and said to them @: "@ I am Masengo , I am here ! @" Ndengeyingoma said to me @: "@ We are Inkotanyi and we came to rescue you . @" He told me to call others , I went back in the building to call them and the ones in the house said to me @: "@ You want us to get killed . @" <EOS>
It has been a good while they did not see me ; I usually came in the night . I said to them @: "@ I can not lie to you ; you know I am the one with the problem so they are inkotanyi . @" They said to me @: "@ You want us to get killed . @" I said no , they are inkotanyi . Few young men went out and found it was them , so they came back to confirm that it was inkotanyi . Some of them refused to come , we were about 1700 people and 30 of them remained there . They [ inkotanyi ] told us to sit on the ground and they said to us @: "@ Go down this way . @" They showed us the way and we knew that road . We went down until we reached the first road in Rugenge , we continued up the second one until we reached the third one known as the heavy weight road [ Poid Lourd ] . We passed through the swamp , heading to Kacyiru by the time we reached Kacyiru it was already in the morning and the soldiers were few around thirty soldiers . The ones who managed to reach Kacyiru continued but other camped there . The soldiers tried to find them places to stay in and they went back to fight with Interahamwe . <EOS>
They fought the whole day to protect the people they rescued . Other soldiers [ Inkotanyi ] joined them in order to give them a hand , in the afternoon that is when the remaining group managed to cross . On the way going , some people like the wife of Manyenzi , another girl lost their lives due to the shooting ; some were caught by the bullets because we were a long chain of people . We went and reached Gisozi , We were welcomed . If I go back a little bit , the 30 people who stayed at Saint Paul saying that it was Interahamwe trying to fool us were killed almost all of them . One man called Ally was one of the few people that survived the Interahamwe attack . He does n't know how he survived all he remembers is that he slept down and they started to kill people . So for us we reached Gisozi . The young men became soldiers and the old women and others were taken to Kabuga . I was one of the young adults that became soldiers . The war [ Genocide ] came to an end . We did not stay longer as soldiers ; some were still young so want to return to school . The main purpose was to quit the army because we felt kind of traumatized when remembering that someone had a family of ten people now he is left alone . <EOS>
We applied to leave the army and some were allowed . We went on and started new hard lives where there is no father , no mother only you alone . We found the houses already destroyed . It was very hard the first days ; there was no food we had to search for it if not try to find a place where to sleep also visit friends . That is the kind of life I lived in . I tried to search if there is any one of my family who is still alive unfortunately all of them died except one girl called Chantal who was out of the country . She was out of Rwanda during the war time . I knew about the death of everyone , my siblings , my mother and I accepted what happened . About the other school I applied for , I was not able to go for it because I felt unhealthy , very weak , I felt I was not able to add two numbers . I wondered why do I have to go to school , will it resurrect my mother so I felt it was useless . A lot of people begged me to go back to school as I was still young . I said to them @: "@ I saw where intellectual people went , even the PHD holder died ! @" <EOS>
I stayed in that miserable life . Sometimes God remembers someone . I and the other sister of mine whom I told you , tried to rebuild our home house in order to have where to stay . In our financial weakness we managed to get small jobs . We worked in O.I.M and the small salary we could get out of it , we would use it to buy cement or other good people would buy for us cement . We finally completed the house . It was a big problem to have where to live ; it was hard for us to stay in several places , spending the whole year changing houses to live in when sometimes the people in there are financially unstable . The ones who are financially stable are mostly bad people . Our houses were destroyed and their too . So asking for help when they also have such problem , we preferred to let it go . After completing the house , my sister got married and I stayed with the housekeeper . As time passed by I had this idea to go back to school and I finally went to school at ULK University . I have finished the second year and I am going for the third year . It does n't mean that the life of genocide survivors is easy ; we are not treated the way we should be treated . We always hear someone is dead , a genocide survivor , and another day you hear a criminal was released . That is the way we live , a criminal was released and a genocide survivor was killed . <EOS>
You hear it on the radios . In this country the security of Genocide survivors is insufficient . We can not forget that we have to live and we are aimed at living but what these men did for us , it is not that hard for us to do it too but we were not created for that . I realized it is even hard for me to kill a rabbit or a chicken . Imagine you take an innocent baby and hit the baby on the wall or remove an old woman all clothes and rape her . You ask yourself if this person was created as you were created and you can not get an answer . Another thing that hurts me , you find a person really confessing proudly of the a hundred people he killed , the horrible way in which he killed those innocent people , and the next day he is realized because of that . You find the government is spending a lot on him while there are old women let 's say in Gisozi who have nothing to eat , no where to live . This should be taken care of , the government should think about this . Okay for us we are still young men , they should care about weak people , wounded people , raped people and old women so they could die happily because the ones who betrayed us die happily . They came back and were given their properties . Got back their money from the bank got back their houses . It is sad to see someone who destroyed your house living in a very nice house of his father . We do n't want those nice houses , the government should build for Genocide survivors houses to live in . it is our right , when he is given back his properties he lives nicely than us . If this is not changed so the government will n't be helping us . <EOS>
Here is what I want ; all people who hurt us should be punished . If not I do n't see where this unity and reconciliation will come from . There is this thing of asking forgiveness between each other and I find it bad . What are we going to ask forgiveness for ? It is because they killed us ! I hear some leaders insisting that we should say sorry as if is there any fault we committed . You hear them saying that they are going to give us indemnity because we do need it . Let me tell you that there is no indemnity that can replace a human . It should not even be called indemnity ; it should be called compensation or another name . They should find a way so the old men and women , and those wounded people could live . They should maintain the security of Genocide survivors . It is sad people are killed in the day time , this happened in Kabuga . In kaduha , it is also the same . You hear a person was sent to prison , but during the visiting days they take for him meat , tea , and other nice things . You find that he struggles only from Monday to Thursday , but he lives nicely on Friday like the way he lived while he is outside . <EOS>
You find that they have already forgotten our people . They say that the Genocide came to an end but you find it is still there , so we do n't understand . Among our leaders there are some who committed crimes during Genocide . I think we have enough intellectuals ; they should remove those bad people and promote others who were not involved in the killings , the innocent ones . It is sad when you know that someone used to killed people , I was always hurt whenever I could see Munyakazi getting promoted in army ranks when he never stopped to come and take people from Saint Paul and Ste Famille . Okay it 's good now he was sent to prison but there are other people like him . They should stop them to work because as they get the kind of jobs they try to hide necessary information . Let 's say if I was a colonel , I would just go and tell someone to leave me alone and to not say anything . They intimidate officials like the ones in the court and they give them respect because of who they are . Those courts respect them for who they are and they can not step forward and arrest them but even though it was an ordinary citizen...they will get killed as well . They should also take them as ordinary citizen and get arrested . The funny thing is that in court they call them "@ Your Honor @" during the time of judgment , how can you judge a man you have already respected that way . <EOS>
If it happens to be a citizen like Masengo , when I arrive in the court they will come straight to the point . They will start to say the crimes I committed and "@ Your Honor @" will be put aside . In brief , this is my testimony and I thank you . <EOS>
Thank you too ; there is someone who said they call you Nsababera , or Nsababera Eraste . <EOS>
Uuh ! <EOS>
Your mother built for him a house ; did you find him after Genocide ? <EOS>
I said about it . <EOS>
If is there anything you can say about it , go on and say it . <EOS>
After when Nsababera Eraste caused us problems in Ste Famille , he came to know where my mother was and shifted her to another place . He really respected my mother . He took her and said to her @: "@ Old woman , things are getting worse here in Kiyovu so leave because you are most wanted . @" He took her from she was , at another old woman and took her to the Carcuters . In the Carcuters that is where my mother lost her life . When Nsababera came back , he got a way to kill people . He respected my mother at a point he could not kill while my mother is watching him . As my mother was far from him , he got strength to kill people . We raised Nsababera as a child in the family . We used to call him Kajevuba [ New Comer ] because my mother did n't know his name . She used to call him Kajevuba . He took the spear and started to kill . <EOS>
He came to kill a man called Ruhotorinyana , Ruhotorinyana 's wife was a Hutu . His wife ran to the sector where she could find the police . Among those police men there was one who was a born again and she reported to him . The born again asked Kajevuba @: "@ Why did you kill Ruhotorinyana ? @" he [ Kajevuba ] replied @: "@ I kill him because he is a Tutsi . @" The born again said to him again @: "@ Do n't you know the rules , so I am going to kill you too because you are a Hutu . @" Kajevuba said @: "@ You can not do that ! @" the born again told him @: "@ I am going to do it . @" Kajavuba said to him @: "@ I have twenty thousand on me , you can have it . @" The born again replied @: "@ No , I do n't want your money . @" Ruhotorinyana 's wife went to report to the police meanwhile Kajebuva and other Interahamwe stayed behind and dug a hole in which they wanted to bury Ruhotorinyana . This born again police man arrived when they have already dug only fifty centimeters but it was enough to put in a person an cover him with sand . The police man said to him again @: "@ You have kill Ruhotorinyana because he is a Tutsi and I am going to kill you because you a Hutu . @" Kajevuba said to the police man @: "@ You can not do this to me ! @" the born again replied @: "@ You think I can n't do it , I am going to do it . @" Kajevuba gave him the twenty thousand , the police man refused . He gave him everything he stole within the few days he spent as killer , few days after my mother 's death but the police man refused . The police man said to him @: "@ Stand in front of the wall and I shoot you . @" He begged him to give him the chance to say goodbye to a man called Gikongoro . The police man said to him @: "@ I do n't care , I came to kill you . @" He stood in front of that wall and he got shot . Ruhotorinyana did not die straight a way . The police was a good person , may God bless him . He called other people to take Ruhotorinyana at the hospital , on the way going to the hospital Ruhotorinyana died . Kajevuba was put in the same hole he dug for Ruhotorinyana and that is how he died . <EOS>
Sometimes a person would say "@ Things are not going well @"@ . You feel like commenting on it , a small advice to the government . Yes it is good you have started the Gacaca justice but it should be followed in a certain way . There is also unity and reconciliation but it should come after this or match in another way so that we can conclude within this direction . The raison I say this is because there are people who are willing to give genocide survivors their respect back , who want criminals to be judged and to send free innocent people . The kind of people who work truthfully , I think this is the way we should pass through . <EOS>
Thank you again ; I do n't know why I did not talk about Gacaca justice . I always follow most of Gacaca justice in our area but there is one thing that hurts me . The Gacaca justice started well , people were learning how it is done and after , it became corrupted . People started to get bribes in order to drop charges . There is a rule that states @: "@ When a decision does not satisfy the congress of Inyangamugayo [ Honest people ] , they have to vote and the majority wins . @" When it 's a case of releasing a person , even the minority has to sign too for that release . It is remarkable especially in our area , there is a trial that has to be repeated because one man was claimed by ten survivors and nothing was done . We were really sure about the crime this man committed but still he was sent free . The survivors sworn to never claim anyone else because their testimonies are useless . <EOS>
What is called ubunyangamugayo [ the fast of being a person with integrity ] it 's not an easy task . Actually the fact of being "@ Inyangamugayo @" [ Honest volunteer ] , you are not allowed to drink beer . You are not even allowed to hit a child because you are an honest person . The Inyangamugayo nowadays are different from the old men in the old time that were called Inyangamugayo . These old men known as Inyangamugayo were really honest . I once heard that a thousand of them were arrested because of corruption . I ask the government to carefully choose a really Inyangamugayo . I am sure the government is not able to look in their hearts but there are some criteria to follow . Like choosing a person who is not related to Genocide , I mean the one who was not involved in any of the acts of Genocide or a person related to few people , another thing not related to Interahamwe . If it happens that I am Inyangamugayo and I have to judge a member of my family , I will do it in the right way . So this thing should be followed up , also they should set the school level they must complete . <EOS>
Studying is a tool to a better knowledge ; the same knowledge will enable you to understand the society and get to know how to handle the society . We do have intellectuals in this country ; let 's take an example of the ones who finished high school because they have lived in society for a while . They know what is true or wrong . You can not take an old man and it happens that he judges his son , this is a rare case . The probability that it happens is one percent out of ninety nine percent . If it happens , the judgment will be dropped . I endorse the fact that Gacaca justice is there . There is no other choice , the number of people is big and the capacity of the country is small so the Gacaca courts are there as a quick solution . This is a good way but there are some people involved in this while they are not Inyangamugayo [ Honest people ] . The good thing is to remove the kind of people ; a person can not commit a mistake first time , second without noticing it . It 's impossible . Thank you . <EOS>
