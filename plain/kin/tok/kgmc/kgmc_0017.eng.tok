We would like to ask you what happened during the genocide ; how you were called , how you responded , how you joined the attackers troops or if there is some one you strungled to death , generally tell us how you saw it . <EOS>
My name is BAMPORIKI EMMANUEL I live in NYAMATA DISTRICT in KIBUNGO SECTOR in the PROVINCE of KIGALI rural . I am married and I have one child , and I am 31 years old . I witnessed every thing that took place in Kibungo . I followed up whatever happened during the day and in the night in that area in 1994 . It is true that there was a war in 1994 and I must admit that I participated in this war with other different people with the object of killing Tutsis and finishing them completely . But before that , the local leaders had sensitized the locals to participate in the killing together with the help of the soldiers , who were later joined by the policemen in the sensitisaton . All those leaders tried to persuade citizens to kill Tutsis . And if anything , to destruct all their properties and they assured us that no one would accuse us or follow up their cases . I will start by telling you what happened in that area . Generally the massacre started on the 9th . If I remember well it is when Ndengeyeinka 's house was destroyed . They even tortured him . On the 10th the massacre continued . Some villagers from this area , together with the help of soldiers , attacked a certain centre called Nyarunazi . So many people lost their lives in that attack . I can remember some of their names . There was Ndekezi , Bikino , Sango and Rubangiza . In that time you could see that people knew what they were doing and they did it with all their efforts . It did not stop there , on the14th April in 1994 . That was when we attacked Ntarama at the church . But before we went there , we held a meeting with people who lived in the sectors that surrounded Ntarama that is ; Kibungo , Kanzenze , Rurindo , Musenyi , people from other neighbouring districts like ; Gitarama district , Kanombe and Butamwa commune plus so many other people from here and there . We had to meet in one place near Ntarama , led by a policeman called Subuhindo who used to live in KANZENZE . I remember very well that we arrived there on the14th . Most of the TUTSI who were being hunted had fled to that church . Most of the soldiers and policemen we were with started planting bombs around the church and throwing grenades in the church . We did not stop there , but we also went and entered the church . We found that some had already died because of the bombs . So we started killing others using machetes , clubs . Honestly one has to say that . That time the TUTSIS were killed very harshly and the truth must be said . I was also there with the intension of killing and I should say that I also participated and I killed an old man using a club . For that reason I was imprisoned for six years . After all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile . When we returned the country I was imprisoned by the current government because I had participated in the massacre that took place in MURAMBI . Later , I admitted and I said the truth on what I did in MURAMBI and the people I was with . I had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow RWANDANS , so I felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it . I was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but I had already admitted and I had said the truth on what happened and the people I was with and I was released after that rule that was given by the president . But it does not mean that I have forgotten what I did . I remember very well that I killed that old man on that morning when I was in NTARAMA and I am always ready to say the truth of what happened in NTARAMA . <EOS>
Besides the Ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ? <EOS>
that centre , but I participated by giving them support like bringing back people who were trying to escape and others would kill them . But I believe that I would also have killed them myself if the people I sent them to had not killed them . I should admit I did terrible things by stopping these people maybe if I had not stopped them they would have escaped and be able to survive . I still admit that I participated in the genocide in public and killed someone using a club . <EOS>
It 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . But you participated in only two ; that of Ntarama and Nyarunazi . Why did n't you participate in several others ? <EOS>
In the area where we lived , we never used to attack homes in the same area . Instead local attackers would be deployed in an area where many people had gathered . What does this mean ... ? The Tutsi whom we were neighbours , left there homes and went to Ntarama plus many other people who had come from different sectors that make up Nyamata district . They all gathered up in Ntarama . Therefore in order to attack them , we had to first make a sufficient team . And verify if we were strong enough to attack . As a result , there were few attacks in my area . However , there was another attack that I followed it 's stories and I know how it started although I never joined it . That was in a place called Bironda in Rusekera cell . That is the only other attack that took place in this sector . The rest of the attackers would gather from Ntarama with an aim of killing people in Ntarama . <EOS>
Did you know the old man you killed ? <EOS>
Sincerely speaking in Ntarama ... I never knew who it was . And the reason why I did know him , in Ntarama several people gathered there ... To be sincere , they were very many and I guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there Identity cards for one to tell who was who . Well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the ID to know who was who or where he was coming from . The main theem was killing . And our motto was to finish the ethenic of Tutsi ... looking for Ids by then , was nosense . Point was in killing only because that was the deal . <EOS>
Do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations . To the extend that , if one had a bias in the Tutsi would ... ? <EOS>
If I consider that war ... as a person who followed up everything yet I was mature by then . We live in peace with our neighbours . I did not have any hatred for TUTSIS because I had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years . But the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of HABYARIMANA . We sensed segregation among people that particular day . People started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at TUTSIS as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the TUTSIS . And so you should stand up and defend him . <EOS>
You have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . That means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed . Well before the Genocide there used to be several political parties . Can you tell us the one you belonged to ? How did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ? <EOS>
Yes I was old enough to join any party I wanted to join and by then I was a member of MDR. I was there as any other Rwandan , and because I was illiterate ; I could not get any good post . Therefore , I simply had a membership card for that party . But what I know is , that party disliked the TUTSIS so much . I had told you that I did not have any hatred for TUTSIS . But most of these parties always taught us that the only enemy we had was a TUTSI . <EOS>
Though you did not have any hatred for the TUTSIS . When MDR was teaching you how TUTSIS were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ? <EOS>
I did not attend most of MDR meetings . But I remember some time when Sebuningo Oswald ; he was the representative of the party in Kibungo sector . He held a meeting at Kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto . But one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . And the whole meeting was about the "@ Hutu . @" Therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights . Thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide . <EOS>
During the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ? <EOS>
During that time of year 1994 , there were many political parties but some were more powerful than others were . For example MRND and CDR. CDR was like a branch of MRND . Those were the most power parties in the country and they had imposed others in the country . <EOS>
We know that you are one of the people who admit that they killed and you are ready to say the truth on what happened in NTARAMA . Are there some of the people you were with in NTARAMA that you accused ? <EOS>
The troop that attacked Ntarama was very big and so powerful and I should say many people died in that attack . I do n't even think that there was anyone who survived . In case there is one , it would have been through God 's mercy . I remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking Ntarama . I accused Sehene Siriveste , Sindikubwabo Gilbert , Karangwa Charles , they all admit that they killed . Plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something . But I accused so many people and that shows that I was not alone . And I realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing I can do to pay the fine of what I did . During the war I was not being hunted . So , I was free as a Rwandan . Therefore , I witnessed whatever happened and I feel that I should say the truth about what happened . Because the majority of Rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . And survivors do not know everything because they were hunted . Others are Rwandans who came from exile . They were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . The only alternative is us who were free by then . And fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector . <EOS>
There is some thing we call ; "@ asking for forgiveness @" and what we call "@ admitting what you did . @" Therefore , I would like to ask you about the survivor ; there are some survivors who do not know those who killed their relatives , and though they survived , they are always hurt about what happened to their people . I would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? Have you ever asked them to forgive you ? <EOS>
It is true that those people faced horrible things and they lost their people , which is very sad . Personally I do not know the family of the person I killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families I decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general . But we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like RWIHEZA INNOCENT . He was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector . We would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise . But the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ Gacaca level . @" In Gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ I am sure we know family per family ] . Then we will count . It would be more or less like a census . Then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies . Well I can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried . Hence they exhume and rebury them officially . In that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything . <EOS>
On behalf of the servivors , it is agony to loss their beloved ones . And when they add on not knowing where those people died , it hurts a lot . In the Gacaca corts that are going to take place in the next few months , we planned to come together as Rwandans and say the whole truth about what happened . We will tell the truth to the survivors and we will pread for forgiveness as much as we can . The crime we committed we will never do it or think about it again . We will tell them the truth about all the people we killed and how they were killed . Those whom we still remember where they were dumped , we will show them to those who survived . And those that we do n't remember ; because they are some who died from here and there . But we shall use "@ saying the truth @" as our weapon to calm them . Saying the truth is nothing much rather than showing people what we did and put everything in open . We have to avoid keeping it as a secrete believing that once you are released from prison , you are going to enjoy out there forgetting the main reason why you were released . We are ready to say the truth in Gacaca . <EOS>
What do you feel about people who criticise the Genocide . People who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of Genocide ? <EOS>
Up to this moment , some Rwandans believe that Genocide is just a simple fight . A fight like that between two drunkards who start it up and maybe one of them dies . The same people say that there was no genocide . I as a Rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , I admit that there was genocide in Rwanda . I do n't deny it . Yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" And they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @" One group of Rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed . Up to this day leaders in the former government are behind it . Yet those of us they were leading in different places by then , admit it as a truth that Genocide happened here . We have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was Genocide . Those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country . There is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her . We admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light . As a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful . Instead they should unit together with the Rwandans who are ready to say the truth . And together tell people what happened and how it happened . They should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime . This means that , there was Genocide . Then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there . Preach them how it took place repeatedly . But not keeping quiet about it . Until when everyone will learn that Genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country . <EOS>
Thanks a lot . I would like to ask you about those who participated in the Genocide yet they are not imprisoned . You may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ? <EOS>
Yes there are there . Up to this moment in my document I mentioned so many Rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed . Some of them are out there and I remember them . When they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily . "@ Though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did . He is lucky he was released . @" That is what they say . One can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . And it is true their time will come and they will be put in open . Because I will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . I do n't intend to hide the Genocide . Therefore , those who are still out there , I would like to remind them that Gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime . Those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . But they should also have the courage to say the truth . Saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed . If it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true . Instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did . Therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only . There is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth . So , you killed some one you better say it . Because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the Genocide . <EOS>
Among those people , do n't you know some who are leaders nowor those who are not at the same level with the locals ? For example people like you who were locals say that ... <EOS>
There are some who are leaders . In the beginning I gave you an example of the cops . When someone is at the level of [ adjudant chef ] is already a leader . I know of someone called Sebuhindo , but I do n't know where he is now . Even policemen are leaders in a country because they are armed . Mr Bizimungu Issac who is in RIRIMA at the moment . He is also a leader . I remember inspector Karerangabo Vincent . He was also a leader and educated . I even remember ... <EOS>
Was he arrested ? <EOS>
No , nobody knows where he fled . The other people that I knew died . but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area . We normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released . <EOS>
After being released he disappeared ? <EOS>
Yes , he disappeared . <EOS>
Where did he flee ? <EOS>
He lives up there ... in the former Kanombe commune . In case he is needed by the authorities I can get him face to face . I know his adresses . <EOS>
Does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why I asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide . Can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy . <EOS>
It would be possible to find them , since the government is putting in a lot of efort in getting those people who participated in the genocide hidding out of the country . For example if I had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to Arusha it is better . if it means to go and witness in Arusha I can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond Rwanda . Lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called Issac . He lives in Ririma . If he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , I can hurry to go there and convict him . I would remind him whatever he did while I was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period . I feel that even the government is delaying me because I am very ready to say the truth on what happened and I feel that I should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too . <EOS>
May be you were not first taught or forced in order to admit what you did . You did it willingly . And by doing that , your punishment was reduced . Do you think that the punishment you were given should be given to the other person who might have done the same crime but denies what he did ? <EOS>
To be honest , the punishment that I was give did not suite the crime I committed . Because when you kill someone you are also suppose to be killed . But that is not what happened , because the current government used a new rule , which says that whoever reveals the truth , his punishment will be reduced . And that is what I chose to do . Therefore , the fact that I was sentenced to a seven years imprisonment yet I killed somebody , but simply because I revealed the truth and asked for forgiveness , pleases me a lot . And I must say that I am pleased . But such people who still denies and hides the truth , they should not be given the same punishment . Because they are hiding the truth and that adds weight on what they did . To me , I believe such people should be punished by the authorities accordingly , following the rules that guide them . <EOS>
In conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to Rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors . <EOS>
What I can tell Rwandans in general , is that "@ it is true there was genocide in our country . @" And so many people died ; more than one million people died as it is shown in the statistics . And all those people were killed by their fellow Rwandans . Which was done in broad daylight . I believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the Rwandans . Therefore I believe that Rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ Rwandans ] . So , I am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it . Because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . People were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open . Therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth . To the genocide survivors I would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible . Which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history . In the past , Rwandans used to be kind . Therefore , I am kindly asking Rwandans to be strong and forgive us . And what we promise to reveal the truth , because that is the only thing we can offer . That is our only contribution ; "@ showing the truth . @" So that , the truth is written in the world 's history . We will tell them how their people were killed , and then ask for forgiveness from the bottom of our hearts . Thank you !!! <EOS>
