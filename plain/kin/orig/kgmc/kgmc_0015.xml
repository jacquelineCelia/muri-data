So let's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by French long ago. it's like they replaced Belgians so that they don't just let us go. It's as if they replaced them yet they hadn't agreed on it. They didn't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that. Actually whenever we disagree with the French, Belgians don't mind it, it makes them come back saying they got they took their place. I guess that's how I understand, it I didn't really think much about it. Belgians left but the French refused since they did not go anywhere at all, instead they said this time since Belgians are leaving. Let's put that little thing back in our pockets.
